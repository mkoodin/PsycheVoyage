It  has  given  me  a  chance  to  reexamine some of what I think I know and discover yet again that 'knowing' is a dynamic and changing process. It has given me a sense of drive to keep expanding my 'comfort zone' by exploring issues and learning things that have taken me beyond the easy and familiar.\nNo one does a sizeable project such as this one truly alone, even though it sometimes seems  that  way  when  it's  2:00  a.m.  and  it's  just  me,  my  computer,  and  some  strong coffee. In truth, there are many people who have helped support, encourage and needle me in the best of ways. My wife, Diane, has been and continues to be my greatest find in roaming the planet and searching for what matters. Her unwavering love, honesty, and the sheer strength of her being is a continuous reminder of how lucky I am to have a life partner who is so very special.\nI have many professional colleagues who have helped teach and inspire me. I want to acknowledge with great appreciation the wonderful people who helped shape my views over  the  years  of  what  it  means  to  be  a  clinician  and  teacher.  I'm  expressive  of  my appreciation for these people, so I have good reason to believe they know who they are. I also want to thank all those friends and colleagues around the world who have invited me to come and teach some of what I know. The clinical trainings keep me well informed about what clinicians want to know and what issues are on their minds, and help provide the encouragement to continually evolve ever-clearer ways of describing and demonstrating hypnotic interventions.\nMy friends and family have also taught and inspired me in more profound ways than I could possibly describe. Every day I am gifted with their love and support for all I do. No matter where I am in the world or what I'm doing, they are always in the forefront of my mind.\nFinally,  I  want  to  acknowledge  the  many  people  at  Brunner-Routledge  who  brought this intensive  project  to  completion.  Brunner-Routledge  has  been  my  professional publishing  home for a very, very long time, and I am grateful for their support of my work.",

        "text": "I  attended my first hypnosis workshop more than 30 years ago, and it shines vividly in my  memory.  While  learning  the  rudiments  of  clinical  hypnosis,  I  was  privileged  to witness  Dr.  Erika  Fromm  conduct  fascinating  demonstrations  of  hypnotic  phenomena including  analgesia,  time  distortion,  and  age  regression.  At  the  time,  there  was  only  a modest empirical foundation for the use of hypnosis in psychotherapy and, in the public eye,  and  even  in  some  professional  circles,  hypnosis  was  as  much  linked  with  hocus pocus, flummery, charlatanism, and the like, as it was associated with bona fide clinical practice. Nevertheless, I had an immediate sense that hypnosis would play an important role  in  my  professional  life,  and  not  long  after,  I  decided  to  be  a  serious  student  of hypnosis. I now believe that virtually every clinical practitioner can benefit from being a student of hypnosis, and I am delighted to introduce Michael Yapko's superb sourcebook on clinical hypnosis: Trancework: An Introduction to the Practice of Clinical Hypnosis .\nWhy use hypnosis as an adjunctive procedure in the first place? Over the years I have learned  that  hypnosis  can  instigate  profound  transformations  in  the  way  people  think, feel, and act. Fundamental to the practice of hypnosis is the idea that deep and enduring change is possible when people are fortified by the belief that they can change and are able to integrate new ideas, perspectives, and growth-oriented experiences into their lives. When  clinicians  introduce  hypnosis  into  the  therapeutic  relationship,  it  is  a  dramatic indication of their intention to be helpful, as well as of their professional expertise and readiness to employ efficient techniques to assist clients create themselves anew. I have often  observed  how  the  mere  expectancy  of  pain  relief  for  the  hurting,  the  balm  of relaxation for the anxious, and a rosier worldview for the depressed can engender hope and  forge  a  positive  therapeutic  alliance  and  mental  set  toward  treatment  in  general. Practitioners  of  hypnosis  are  likely  to  be  attuned  to  the  helpful  as  well  as  the  harmful effects  of  words  and  nonverbal  communications,  and  are  trained  to  devise  therapeutic suggestions  that  can  target  the  cognitive  and  behavioral  under-pinnings  of  diverse psychological  disorders  and  medical  conditions  with  exquisite  precision.  A  suggestive approach,  at  its  best,  involves  an  intimate  collaboration  with  the  client  geared  toward determining  some  combination  of  effective  strategies  and  techniques.  It  is  to  Michael Yapko's credit that he has captured and made explicit in this volume many of the details and  fine  points  of  how  effective  therapy  can  occur  when  hypnosis  is  used  as  a  core component of the intervention. In this way, the author achieves one of his central goals: to convey the 'artistry' of hypnosis to the reader.\nAn  emerging  body  of  research  supports  the  idea  that  hypnosis  can  be  an  effective catalyst to therapies ranging from cognitive-behavioral to psychodynamic (Barber, 1985; Lynn,  Kirsch,  Barabasz,  Cardeña,  &  Patterson,  2000).  Nevertheless,  newcomers  to hypnosis  are  often  chary  about  learning  hypnosis  given  the  cultural  myths  that  have surrounded it from the time of Mesmer, and are intimidated by the prospect of crafting\ninductions  and  suggestions  and  of  not  'doing  hypnosis  right.'  If  you  are  such  a newcomer, Trancework is  an  authoritative  primer that will start you on your way. In a step-wise,  logical  sequence,  you  will  learn  the  nuts  and  bolts  of  how  to:  (a)  establish rapport and demystify hypnosis, (b) create an hypnotic induction and devise a plethora of useful therapeutic suggestions, (c) assess responsiveness to suggestions, and (d) minimize untoward reactions to hypnotic procedures.\nReaders  already  familiar  with  hypnotic  procedures  will  appreciate  the  nuanced  and engaging  discussions  of  influential  hypnosis  theories,  the  role  of  informed  consent  in treatment, recent developments in cognitive neuroscience in understanding hypnosis, the pros  and  cons  of  formal  versus  informal  hypnotic  suggestibility  assessment,  and  the advantages  and  disadvantages  of  different  types  of  hypnotic  suggestions  (e.g.,  direct, indirect, permissive, authoritative) and  manualized  versus  individualized  treatment approaches. Novice and seasoned readers alike will appreciate the humor and wit, good advice,  anecdotes,  and  rich  case  material  that  is  the  author's  stock-in-trade.  I  found myself  flipping  through  the  pages  like  I  was  reading  compelling  nonfiction,  and  like some of the novels I treasure, I was disappointed when the book ended.\nThe title, which features the controversial term 'trance,' might dissuade some readers from perusing the book. That would be a mistake. As the author explains, the title is a vestige  of  previous  editions  of  the  book,  and  was  retained  in  this  thoroughly  updated revised  edition  in  order  to  identify  it  with  its  two  immensely  successful  predecessors. Although  Yapko  acknowledges  that  the  term  'trance'  is  obsolete,  there  is  nothing obsolete about the contents of the book. In fact, Trancework brims with virtually up-tothe-minute  references  to  research,  contemporary  hypnosis  theories,  clinical  issues  and techniques,  and  intellectually  stimulating  controversies  and  theoretical  debates.  The author's  presentation  of  controversies  regardingthe  nature  of  hypnosis  and  the  role  of hypnosis in creating false memories isfair to different theoretical perspectives, faithful to the empirical literature,and accessible to a wide audience.\nIt is evident that writing this book was a labor of love for Michael Yapko. He speaks with the authority of many years of clinical experience, shared in this and his many other excellent books. But he is also a knowledgeable, clear, and compassionate teacher who takes  seriously  the  challenge  of  making  the  skills  of  hypnosis  accessible  to  a  broad audience. I heartily recommend Michael Yapko's Trancework to what I hope will be a growing legion of students of hypnosis around the world.\n-Steven Jay Lynn, Ph.D., ABPP Professor of Psychology Binghamton University Binghamton, NY",

        "text": "First, let me say a few words about why a new edition was necessary, and what you can expect to find in this volume. The second edition of Trancework came out in 1990, more than a dozen years ago, and so much has happened in the field in the interim that this revision  is  actually  quite  long  overdue.  In  fact,  so  much  has  evolved  that  I  considered changing the title of the book simply to eliminate the use of the obsolete word 'trance' just to keep in step with the times. But, the title Trancework is so well known within the field that it made practical sense to keep it, thereby requiring people to look beyond the title to see what's new.\nSo, what's new in this third edition? Two brand new chapters have been added, as have many entirely new chapter sections spread throughout the book. Other chapters have been substantially modified, a response to the explosion of good recent studies revealing and clarifying many aspects of hypnosis. An invaluable addition to this edition are the many hundreds  of  reference  citations  provided  throughout  the  text.  For  careful  readers  who want to be pointed in the direction of supportive research for points made, or who simply want further information on a particular topic, the extensive reference sections at the end of each chapter will be welcome.\nEvery  field  has  its  share  of  distinguished  contributors,  and  clinical  hypnosis  is  no exception. You will be introduced to many of them in this book through special sections throughout called 'Frames of Reference.' In these sections, you will hear pioneers and innovators  in  the  field  of  hypnosis  present  some  of  their  ideas  on  principles  and applications of hypnosis. I am pleased to have the chance to introduce you to some of the field's most influential figures.\nT rancework is  a  textbook  meant  to  guide  your  training  in  hypnosis.  It  is  meant  to inspire you, of course, but also to teach the skills to be effective in applying hypnosis. The chapters are filled with practical information, and at the end of almost every chapter, you will be presented with 'Things to Discuss' and 'Things to Do.' I hope and expect you will find these an invaluable part of the learning process.",

        "text": "Clinical  hypnosis  has  been  the  subject  of  serious  scientific  inquiry  for  only  about  70 years, but has been the source of fascination for students of human experience for more than two centuries. Only in the last two decades, however, has hypnosis research reached a level of sophistication that offers some objective evidence for its clinical value.\nThree  powerful  forces  converged  in  the  1990s  and  continue  to  the  present  that  reshaped  many  of  our  understandings  of  clinical  hypnosis.  The  first  of  these  forces  has been  the  growing  emphasis  in  the  field  of  psychotherapy  on  proving  its  worth  with empirical data affirming its effectiveness. The drive for developing so-called empirically supported psychotherapies  has  pushed and pulled the  field  in  different,  and  sometimes even  contradictory,  directions,  taking  hypnosis  along  with  it  since  hypnosis  is  most commonly applied in the psychotherapeutic domain. A direct result is the division within the field of those who see hypnosis as a vehicle for delivering 'standard' psychotherapies (e.g., cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, etc.) and not a therapy in its own right, and those who see hypnosis as a special form of therapy reflected in the self-defining term 'hypnotherapy.' Regardless of one's position, the salient research questions have been, 'Does hypnosis enhance treatment results?' and, 'Can hypnosis correctly be considered an 'empirically supported' style of intervention?'\nThe second force re-shaping clinical hypnosis in recent years directly and explosively collided with the first. I'm referring to the so-called repressed memory controversy. In the  mid  1990s,  the  controversy  reached  its  zenith,  bitterly  dividing  the  mental  health profession over the presumed role of repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse as the  underlying  cause  of  a  client's  current  symptoms.  Extreme  positions  by  'experts' dominated the field, encouraging clinicians to either believe all memories excavated in treatment  through  hypnosis  and  other  suggestive  memory  retrieval  techniques  or  to disbelieve  all  such  memories  as  fabrications  in  response  to  untoward  influence  by therapists or others. (The controversy has since quieted as evidence for both/all points of view helped define an informed clinical practice.) Suddenly, hypnosis and the phenomenon of human suggestibility was in the center spotlight as experts in persuasion, interrogation, memory, trauma, and hypnosis squared off against each other, both in the journals and the tabloids, further confusing an already confused public about what it all meant. Meanwhile, each day's headlines blared a new story of some trusted figure being accused of abuse on the basis of memories recovered in hypnosis. The field of clinical hypnosis was forced to redefine itself more scientifically while directly addressing and correcting many of the common myths held about the nature of human memory and how it is affected by hypnotic procedures.\nThe  third  major  force  reshaping  the  field  has been  the  advances  in  cognitive neuroscience.  There  is  something  about  the  experience  of  hypnosis  that  invites  careful neurophysiological inquiry. After all, unusual things happen: A person has normal bodily perceptions one minute, then focuses on suggestions for experiencing a dramatic change in bodily sensations, and the next minute the person actually experiences those suggested\nchanges.  How  does  the  mind  influence  the  brain  in  hypnosis,  and  vice  versa?  Newer scanning  technologies,  such  as  functional  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (fMRI),  have made it possible to begin investigating the brain during hypnotic procedures in ways that simply were not possible years ago. The possibilities in this new domain of research are very exciting and may eventually help us focus our clinical efforts.",

        "text": "Has a state of hypnosis, what used to popularly be called a 'trance state,' been identified? No, nor do people in hypnosis generally think of themselves in some unique altered state of consciousness. The use of the term 'trance' to characterize the experience of hypnosis is not  particularly  descriptive  of  anything  either  scientifically  precise  or  clinically relevant, and so I have dropped it from the body of this volume. Instead, I will talk about the subjective experiences of hypnosis from the standpoint of the person in hypnosis, and the  processes  of  hypnosis  from  the  standpoint  of  the  person  conducting  the  hypnosis session. I will generally use the term 'client' to refer to the former, and either 'clinician' or 'therapist' to refer to the latter.\nWith  data  being  the  new  currency  in  the  field,  researchers  have  taken  a  newly ascendant position, and clinicians a largely defensive one, struggling to continue to do what they feel works, even if the evidence is not yet there to validate them. Clinicians understand that no matter how much scientific data are generated, clinical practice will always require a high level of artistry. Consequently, I think it is imperative to provide you with some expo-sure to the scientific side of hypnosis, citing many (but only a small percentage of) the good research studies available. And, I think it even more imperative to  highlight  the  actual  skills  that  go  into  developing  and  delivering  effective  hypnotic processes. After all, no matter how much data and scientifically supported rationales you might  have  for  a  specific  intervention,  it  means  next  to  nothing  if  the  client  doesn't benefit  from  it.  (Frankly,  it's  why  I'd  prefer  we  'validate' therapists rather  than therapies.)  As  you  can  tell,  I'm  a  pragmatist.  My  emphasis  throughout  this  book  will reflect that orientation, highlighting what is practical and effective.\nHelping you evolve the artistry in both conceptualizing and applying clinical hypnosis is a primary goal of this volume, especially in light of recent clinical controversies and the demands of modern clinical practice in an age of accountability. I hope you will enjoy learning  both  the  art  and  science  of  clinical  hypnosis.  And,  I  especially  hope  you  will discover both the personal and professional enrichments as well as the many benefits to your clients when you integrate clinical hypnosis into your practice.\n-Michael D.Yapko, Ph.D. June 2003 www.yapko.comcom",

        "text": "Although I am not a practitioner of the Ericksonian approach, nor a strategic therapist, and hold different opinions on aspects of hypnotism from Michael Yapko, I believe I can correctly  state  that Trancework is an  excellent  exposition  of  current  teachings  on Ericksonian  therapy  or,  as  the  author  prefers  to  say,  of  the  naturalistic  approach originated by Milton H.Erickson.\nThe  naturalistic  approach  to  therapy  and  to  hypnotism  can  be  summed  up  in  a  few words: It is the 'utilization,' that is, the use by the therapist of whatever capacities and kinds of responses the patient has and is capable of giving at any particular moment; even his or her symptoms can be used.\nT rancework is also an  excellent  introduction  to  strategic  therapy,  which  is  an outgrowth  of  this  naturalistic  approach.  Strategic  therapy  was  originally  defined  quite broadly  by  Jay  Haley  (as  a  result  of  his  study  of  Erickson's  therapeutic  work)  as  any therapy in which the therapist takes the responsibility of directly influencing the patient according to a plan of treatment determined by the presenting problem. But to be a true reflection  of  Erickson's  approach, as  it  was  intended  to  be,  this  definition  should  have added that the plan is also determined by what can be utilized out of what is offered by the patient at any given moment, a plan that is both fluid and unique for each patient. It is in this sense that I see Trancework as an exposition of strategic therapy.\nHowever, Trancework is not just an exposition of Ericksonian methods or of strategic therapy. It is more; it is a reflection of Michael Yapko's personal understandings, skills, and  experience  as  a  psychotherapist  and  psychologist.  One  way  of  summing  up Erickson's approach to psychotherapy is to say that it is an integration of hypnotic and nonhypnotic phenomena brought about naturalistically for therapeutic purposes. It is to Yapko's credit that he not only has been able to capture the essence of this approach, but he has also been able to make it available in a practical way.\nWhile  the  author's  subject  matter  is  primarily  clinical  hypnotism  as  viewed  from within  a  naturalistic  framework,  he  does  not  ignore  matters  pertaining  to  traditional hypnotism and introduces the reader to its principal concepts and methods. With fairness, he  points  out  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  two  approaches  as  he  sees  them, although clearly giving his overall preference to the naturalistic approach.\nThere is considerable didactic material in Trancework, but the book remains above all a practical work aiming not only to teach the reader the art of doing hypnotherapy but, more importantly, the art of doing effective psychotherapy. For, as already intimated, it is in the nature of the Ericksonian approach not to separate the use of hypnotic patterns of communication  from  therapeutic  communications  in  general.  For  both  Erickson  and Yapko, effective communication is the key to both the skilled use of hypnotic phenomena and to effective psychotherapy. One may not necessarily agree with the author that all influencing  communications  constitute  hypnosis-which  seems  to be his  position-but\nthere is no question that readers who practice the communication techniques he details will be well on their way to becoming skilled clinical hypnotists and therapists.\nA valuable pedagogical feature of the work that should not be over-looked are the lists of topics for discussion and the assignments with which each chapter terminates. Readers would be well advised to give them their attention.\nT rancework will  be  a  good starting point for beginners, and a good review for more advanced workers. It brings together a great deal of material, and should be particularly instructive for practitioners who have thus far limited themselves strictly to the traditional approach.\n-André M.Weitzenhoffer, Ph.D. Nathrop, Colorado",

        "text": "When Trancework first came out in 1984, it was riding on a wave of enthusiasm for the creative approaches to hypnosis and hypnotically based psychotherapy of the late Milton H.Erickson,  M.D.  The  focus  on  Erickson  and  his  innovative  methods  has  spawned  a whole  new  generation  of  clinicians  interested  in  hypnosis  and  the  applications  it  may have in various clinical contexts. Trancework is not a book about Erickson, though. It is a book about practical methods for developing the kinds of relationship and communication  skills  that  will  increase  the  effectiveness  of  your  clinical  methods, regardless of the context in which they are applied. I am a practical-minded fellow who is interested in therapeutic patterns that work. Erickson's emphasis was also a practical one, which I can appreciate. His influence on the material contained here is significant.\nThis  second  edition  represents  an  effort  to  make  the  acquisition  of  skills  to  apply hypnosis more easily accomplished by the reader. The exercises and discussions can be the  most  powerful  teachers  of  hypnotic  skill,  but  this  revised  edition  presents  new features that will enhance the learning process. First, two new chapters have been added. Chapter  19  contains  transcripts  of  portions  of  actual  hypnosis  sessions  conducted  with bona fide clients. Chapter 20 presents a verbatim clinical session in its entirety, including commentary  intended to amplify points of interest in the learning of hypnotic communication.  Both  new  chapters  are  intended  to  provide  greater  insight  into  the clinical applications of hypnosis and are considered a valuable addition to the text.\nAnother new feature is the Frames of Reference sections, which include worthwhile quotes on a variety of stimulating topics from leading figures in the field. These Frames of Reference provide an enjoyable glimpse into the thinking and the history of notable authorities.  The  reader  will  note  that  the  Frames  of  Reference  are  listed  separately, immediately following the table of contents.\nAlso  new  to  this  edition  are  20  tables  that  clearly  and  succinctly  provide  key information. These tables can be easily memorized, allowing more rapid integration of the  material.  What  makes  hypnosis  so  potentially  useful  a  tool?  Is  it  the  emphasis  on acknowledging and respecting the subjective reality of each individual client?  Is  it  the emphasis  on  the  cooperative  nature  of  the  therapeutic  relationship?  Is  it  the  enhanced appreciation  and  use  of  the  recognition  that  words  can  heal?  Certainly,  all  these  are factors  contributing  to  the  effectiveness  of  hypnotic  patterns,  but  the  strength  of  doing trancework comes from undefinable sources within each human being. Whether these are termed  the  'unconscious,'  'inner  wisdom,'  'the  God  within,'  or  some  other  equally ambiguous name, there is a remarkable potential in each person that surfaces during those states  of  absorption  called  'trance'  that  one  can  readily  appreciate.  If  there  is  a  more dynamic and potent means of empowering individuals than by working hypnotically, I am not yet aware of it.\nIt is unfortunate, but nonetheless true, that the field of hypnosis remains an internally\nconflicted one. The focus on the clinical approaches of Erickson has been substantial in the last decade, and it is a basic truth that every movement creates a countermovement. While many were (noncritically) touting the wonders of 'Ericksonian hypnosis,' others were  openly  criticizing  the  apparent  lack  of  objectivity  in  such  strong  claims.  Just  as there  are  divisions  in  the  field  of  psychotherapy,  there  are  those  who  align  themselves with one model of hypnosis and openly express disapproval for any other model. It is my hope that Trancework will permit you to side-step issues of alignment and instead focus on  issues  associated  with  discovering  how  you  as  an  individual  practitioner  can  best apply these approaches in a manner congruent with your training and personality. While I generally favor the flexibility of less direct and imposing techniques, I am quite aware that what works well for me may not work as well for someone else.\nKnowing what I know about trance states and ways to induce and utilize them, I am inclined  to  integrate  the  seemingly  irreconcilable  views  about  hypnosis.  I  generally promote  the  perspective  that  while  the  experimental  production  of  specific  trance phenomena  is  not  an  apparent  capability  of  all  people,  the  'real  life'  utilization  of specific trance phenomena to create reality (including wellness and illness) is evident in all.  The  question  of  what  is  and  what  is  not  'trance'  is  interesting  fodder  for  debates which cannot be won, but is irrelevant when a client is in distress and needs a skilled, flexible, creative therapist to interrupt self-limiting patterns while building self-enhancing ones.\nTechnique  is  inevitably  bound  to  context.  What  succeeds  in  one  context  can  be faithfully duplicated but still yield unfortunate results in another context. What Trancework is  ultimately  about  is  synthesizing  what  is  known  about  social  influence, communication,  psychotherapy,  and  clinical  hypnosis  in  order  to  sensitize  you  to  the healing  power  of  words,  the  healing  power  of  beliefs,  and  the  healing  power  of relationships.\nIn  that  regard,  I  have  chosen  not  to  focus  on  facts  and  issues  unrelated  to  the development of actual skills in using hypnosis. Detailing the ancient history of hypnosis or reporting unusual experiments with hypnosis that lead to nonclinical questions such as whether  or  not  hypnosis  can  be  used  to  get  someone  to  rob  a  bank  is  simply  not consistent with my aim in writing Trancework . I am all too aware that most professionals do  not  get  their  hypnosis  training  in  academic  institutions-they  get  it  in  privately sponsored  workshops.  If  you  are  taking  a  university-sponsored  course  in  hypnosis, consider yourself fortunate to have some progressive aspects in your curriculum. Most hypnosis training takes place in small groups of interested and experienced clinicians. As one who routinely offers such training, I am aware of the participants' desire to focus on skill-building above all else. For this reason, I have included things to discuss and things to do in every chapter. The conceptual framework of the first part of the book is simply a foundation for more easily assimilating the techniques of the second part of the book. The true skills, however, come only with practice, as you would naturally expect.\nI  would like to make one final point about usage in this edition. Rather than refer to people exclusively as male, as tradition suggests, or exclusively as female, as I did in the first  edition,  I  have  consistently  made  use  of  both  male  and  female  pronouns  in  an inconsistent  way,  thoughout  the  book.  Male  and  female  therapists;  male  and  female clients. Just like in the real world.\nI  hope  you  find Trancework a  valued  ally  in  your  efforts  to  learn  clinical  hypnosis. More importantly, I hope you find resources in yourself you can appreciate as you learn. -Michael D.Yapko, Ph.D. San Diego, California",

        "text": "Milton  Erickson  was  known  for  his  flexible  and  effective  therapeutic  communication which was predicated to a great extent on his ability to read nonverbal behavior. Early in my  training  with  Erickson,  I  asked  for  instruction  to  be  able  to  better  understand nonverbal behavior. In an amused fashion, he asked if I knew the definition of 'zyzzyx.' I  replied  that  I  did  not  and  asked  what  it  meant.  He  instructed  me  to  look  it  up  in  the dictionary,  stating  that  you  first  learn  the  alphabet,  then  the  words,  then  the  grammar. There is no substitute for direct experience and, before one goes on to complex tasks, it is important to really know the basics.\nIn this volume, Michael Yapko presents the alphabet of hypnotic influence communication  based  in  part  on  Erickson's  strategic  and  symptom-based  therapy,  a methodology  that  uses  hypnosis  both  formally  and  naturalistically  to  promote  change. Whereas  traditional  therapy  made  understanding  and  insight  primary,  Ericksonian methods center on promoting effective living independent of the therapeutic situation. To accomplish  goals  and  to  maximize  patient-based  change,  Erickson  pioneered  indirect techniques,  noting  that  communication  occurs  on  multiple  levels,  including  the  verbal content,  the  implications,  and  such  extraverbal  factors  as  tone,  duration,  intensity,  and body language. In fact, some experts maintain that only a small fraction of our response to communication is due to the verbal content.\nTraditional  therapists  interpret  the  patient's  multiple  level  communication,  that  is, describe  back  to  the  patient  what  he  'really  means.'  Modern  Ericksonian  methods, however,  are  predicated  on  the idea that if the patient is intelligent enough  to communicate  on  more  than  one  level,  the  therapist  should  be  equally  intelligent. Therapeutic communication does not need to be interpretive, concrete, direct, or linear to be effective. In fact, therapeutic communication is best when the therapist is flexible, uses indirect techniques, and focuses as many output channels of communication as possible (Zeig, 1980).\nYapko  gently  eases  us  into  the  world  of  hypnotic  communication.  He  provides  a balance  between  direct  and  indirect  techniques,  integrating  clear  examples  of  each approach  into  the  text.  Examples  also  are  given  of  content  and  process  techniques (roughly,  those  that  are  specific  and  those  that  are  more  general).  Direct  and  indirect techniques along with process and content suggestions have their place in therapy. Yapko does  not  tell  us  which  to  use  or  when  to  use  them;  rather,  he  examines  possibilities, presenting  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  each,  reminding  us  that  the  amount  of indirection to be used is directly proportional to the perceived resistance.\nYapko's approach to hypnosis is a radical departure from other authorities. He defines hypnosis  as  influence  communication-a  position  sure  to  be  considered  controversial because some might think that definition too general, thereby unnecessarily diluting the territory.  However,  Yapko  presents  his  arguments  cogently  and  has  a  position  that\ndeserves recognition in the literature and can be supported by citations and references.\nT rancework was  written  to  promote  clinical  hypnosis  and  make  it  more  available  to psychotherapists. It will motivate many to enter the field and broaden their interests so that there will be active use of and research into hypnotic communication.\nI  find  this  book  particularly  interesting  when  it  describes  the  induction  process,  the utilization  of  trance  phenomena,  and  the  wording  of  different  types  of  suggestions. Professionals will appreciate the attention given to the ethical use of hypnosis. In good Ericksonian fashion, we are admonished to attend to individual differences and meet the patient at his frame of reference; the emphasis is on communication skills, not on rigid formulas.\nT rancework provides  the  building  blocks  necessary  to  learn  the  vocabulary  and grammar  of  hypnotherapy  and  effective  forms  of  influence  communication.  We  look forward to other expositions from this talented writer.\n-Jeffrey K.Zeig, Ph.D. Director, The Milton H.Erickson Foundation Phoenix, Arizona",

        "text": "If the word 'hypnosis' conjures up images of a powerful, magician-like figure dangling a gold  watch  in  the  face  of  a  stuporous  subject  while  giving  the  command  to  'sleep deeply,'  then  you  are  in  a  for  a  pleasant  surprise.  Not  only  is  that  not  what  clinical hypnosis is all about, but that old stereotype of hypnosis has little relevance to the current perspective of hypnosis as a rich system of communication.\nHypnotic patterns are evident wherever influential communication occurs. The artistry of  meaningful  applications  of  hypnosis  can  be  appreciated  when  one  considers  the dynamics of how one person can use communication to alter the experience of another.\nIt  is  my  hope  and  anticipation  that  hypnosis  will  become  a  significant  part  of  your range of interactional skills, even if after reading this book you never formally induce a trance in anyone for the remainder of your life. Although that may seem a grandiose goal for  a  hypnosis  book,  many  years  of  teaching  hypnosis  to  practicing  professionals  and graduate students have convinced me that the skills in communication described in this book can make a positive difference in the work you do and in the relationships you form with virtually everyone.\nSo  much  has  happened  in  recent  years  in  the  fields  of  clinical  hypnosis,  clinical psychology, communications, linguistics, neurology, and other fields relevant to understanding human behavior that the impact has yet to be fully appreciated. Certainly a revolution has taken place in perspectives on hypnosis, described throughout this book. In the past there have been numerous theories explaining the various phenomena associated with  the  trance  state,  yet  the  practice  of  hypnosis  was  generally  limited  to  one  of  two forms:  (1)  the  'traditional'  application  of  hypnosis  emphasizing  the  power  of  the hypnotist in relationship to an obedient subject (this approach is best represented by the stage hypnotist), and (2) a 'standardized' approach emphasizing the responsibility of the client  to  adapt  herself  to  a  scripted,  and  therefore  nonindividualized,  program  of  the hypnotist  (best  represented  by  prepackaged  tapes  and  'cookbook'  treatments).  Both approaches have been quite limited in their ability to obtain positive results reliably (see Appendix A).\nFortunately,  the  field  of  hypnosis  has  evolved  past  these  two  limited  approaches  in recent years. This development is due in large part to the innovative and untiring work of the late psychiatrist and hypnosis pioneer Milton H.Erickson, M.D. Erickson evolved his own unique techniques which could recognize and use the creativity and individuality of each person. Recently, numerous texts and articles have flooded the hypnosis literature promoting Erickson's methods, collectively called the 'utilization' approach, though also referred  to  as  'Ericksonian  hypnosis.'  In  this  model,  emphasis  is  placed  upon  the utilization of as many dimensions of the client's inner world as possible, particularly the unconscious mind's unique resources.\nThe progression of hypnosis as a field beyond demanding blind obedience and offering\nscripted routines has radically changed  its conceptual and practical frameworks. Hypnosis is no longer the 'occultish' mystery it once was, although undeniably there are still things about hypnosis remaining to be explained. With  the progression in understandings  about  hypnosis has also come  acceptance.  Although  most  people encountering hypnosis for the first  time  still  do  so  in  a  stage  show  context,  increasing numbers  of  people  are  also  being  made  aware  of  its  clinical  and  other  appropriate professional  uses.  Typically,  they  have  been  made  aware  through  the  media,  which frequently runs programs and articles on hypnosis, or through friends who have obtained help through hypnosis.\nThe sole  purpose  of  this  book  is  to  introduce  professionals  to  the  rich  and  complex world  of  clinical  hypnosis.  I  hope  it  will  allow  you  to  acquire  a  comprehensive understanding of the concepts and issues related to its practice, and to acquire the basic skills  that  only  years  of  regular  practice  and  continued  pursuit  of  excellence  can  build upon. Re-read, if you don't mind, the last sentence. It is one written with great sincerity. To become truly skilled in the use of hypnosis (or any other worthwhile endeavor for that matter) takes a great deal of time and commitment. This book can provide a broad and solid framework of understanding and experience that more advanced, specialized studies of hypnosis can build upon.\nThere are plenty of books, cassette and videotape packages, and training programs that promise to make you a hypnotist 'overnight.' They are not lying, either, for you can be a hypnotist  overnight.  Guiding  a  person  into  trance  is  not  particularly  difficult,  nor  is reading a prepared script to the hypnotized subject. Such approaches may even get some positive results occasionally. However, obtaining consistent results across a wider range of  client  concerns  requires  a  sensitivity  and  deeper  knowledge  that  is  not  available  in such approaches. Developing sensitivity to the individual needs of the client and learning how to best develop her unique inner resources is not taught in the 'overnight hypnotist' programs.  Only  rigid  formulas  are.  The  oversimplifications  of  the  traditional  and standardized approaches make them, in many instances, undesirable for use.\nUnfortunately, a powerful tool like hypnosis can be placed in the hands of people who are not in a position to appreciate the full implications of its use. This is another reason why  anyone  can  be  a  hypnotist:  It  is  legal  for  anyone  who  wants  to  to  hang  out  the 'hypnotist'  shingle  on  her  door  with  no  formal  credentials,  not  even  a  high  school diploma. Hypnotists who are untrained in the health professions are routinely providing physical and psychological health care, under ambiguous names of course, but health care nonetheless. Some are really quite good at what they do, but the potential dangers should be apparent.\nAfter you have read this book you will be faced with decisions about how much more, if  any, training and proficiency you want to obtain. Beyond what you will be aware of learning,  you  can  learn  a  great  deal  more  without  even  realizing  you  are  learning,  and perhaps you can decide to learn just enough to take pride in your knowledge and skills. This is a book for training in hypnosis. There are exercises to do, concepts and terms to master, and points to discuss. I encourage you to experience and practice all the\ntechniques you can. Ultimately, you can read about hypnosis, then read more about it, and talk about it, and then read still more about it, but there is no substitute for hours and hours of working with it. A lot of commitment, but the payoff is most rewarding.\n-Michael D.Yapko, Ph.D. San Diego, California",

The  numerous  doctors  she  presented  her  symptoms  to  seemed  unconcerned,  and  she reported  that  several  were  even  abrupt  and  dismissive  of  her.  She  assumed  the unwelcome reactions she received from her doctors were probably because her patient file was so thick and included an extensive history of mental health issues. The doctors reasoned, and apparently more than one even said it to her directly, that anyone with such  an  accumulation  of  hospitalizations  and  doctor  visits,  most  of  them  psychiatric, must  be  a  deeply  troubled  woman.  Presumably,  she  must  be  prone  to  exaggeration  at least, and she may be a frustrating and time-consuming hypochondriac, or perhaps she is even  delusional  She  rationally  countered,  'But,  even  hypochondriacs  get  sick!'  and asked for appropriate medical tests. By the time she was finally diagnosed with terminal cancer, it was too late for her to be heard. The cancer had already spread throughout her body, and was in her brain, bones, lungs, and adrenals. She was told she had a very short time left to live, probably just weeks. There were no apologies or expressions of regret from her dismissive doctors.\nV icki had tumors growing in her body that caused her considerable pain at times. She was  told by her newly  sympathetic doctors that she could have  whatever  pain medications she might need or want to make her last days comfortable. But Vicki didn't want to take any pain medications at all, if possible, out of concern that she would be negatively  affected  mentally  by  them.  She  wanted  to  be  fully  alert  mentally  and  as physically active as possible in whatever time she might have left. She found her way to me in order to explore whether it might be possible for her to learn how to use her mind to  manage  pain  without  drugs.  She  had  heard  that  clinical  hypnosis  was  a  valuable therapeutic tool that could even be used by patients to undergo major surgeries without the  use  of  any  chemical  anesthesia.

What could I teach her about her inner experiences and hidden resources that would help her manage dying with the kind of dignity and clarity she wanted?\nB y the time we began the hypnosis session, Vicki had revealed many facets of her Self that  were  extraordinary:  courage,  determination,  resilience,  focus,  and  so  many  more. All that she had experienced in her life, right up to age 42 when I saw her, had come to serve  as  powerful  personal  resources.  What  hypnosis  does  best  is  amplify  people's",

A  full  transcript  of  my  entire session  with  Vicki,  including  commentary  and  analysis,  can  be  found  in  chapter  20 . When you have learned what's in the chapters between here and there, you'll likely find the  session  a  moving  example  of  how  hypnosis  can  be  used  to  make  a  meaningful difference for someone struggling with issues as deep and powerful as life and death.\nThe power of hypnosis. The 'magic' of hypnosis. The mystery of hypnosis. The very word has an aura of intrigue associated with it.\nWhat is hypnosis? How is hypnosis relevant to clinical intervention in treating client problems? And, how can you begin to acquire the skills for incorporating hypnosis into your  clinical  practice?  These  three  questions  provide  the  foundation  for  this  text,  and aspects of the complicated answers will evolve as each chapter unfolds. This book will provide clinicians wanting to learn hypnosis with both perspectives and methods that are based on current scientific understandings of hypnosis as well as the realities of modern clinical practice.\nHypnosis has no single agreed upon definition (Lynn & Rhue, 1991). A widely cited definition  is  the  one  offered  by  the  American  Psychological  Association's  hypnosis division, called the Society of Psychological Hypnosis (1993): 'Hypnosis is a procedure during which a health professional or researcher suggests that a client, patient, or subject experience  changes  in  sensations,  perceptions,  thoughts,  or  behavior.'  This  broad definition acknowledges the role of the person doing hypnosis, the context in which it is done, and the role of the person experiencing hypnosis. What happens in the mix of these three factors that makes it possible for someone to essentially direct someone else to have an experience that, under normal conditions, would seem, at the very least, unlikely? For example, telling someone to have a sense of numbness in a particular physical location is not typical conversation! Something very special is going on in the world of hypnosis, as I hope and expect you will discover here.\nHypnosis has been up and down on the roller coaster of acceptability to both layperson and  professional  alike.  To  help  gain  acceptance  for  hypnosis  (or  themselves),  some practitioners have made some pretty wild claims, sensationalized treatment results, and, in  general,  built  hypnosis  up  into  a  magical,  mystical  process  that  seems  to  have everything going for it but a formal endorsement from the Almighty. Unfortunately, the more  grandiose  a  claim  for any product  or  service,  the  more  skeptical  the  careful consumer must become, and the more extreme a position its advocates are subsequently pushed into. The result is almost inevitably more turn-offs than turn-ons.\nIn  recent  years,  however,  hypnosis  has  increasingly  become  the  subject  of  serious scientific inquiry, effectively scaling down the grandiose claims while steadily increasing what can be said in its favor with substantive evidence. Thousands of articles have been published in the best of scientific journals (Nash, Minton, &  Baldridge, 1988; Weitzenhoffer, 2000), and membership in the professional societies has encouraged more and more clinicians and researchers to join together to investigate the merits of hypnosis",

        "text": "(Baker, 1987; Lynn, Kirsch, Neufeld, & Rhue, 1996).\nHypnosis is an innately fascinating topic to most people. It's a phenomenon that invites lively discussion, curious speculation, and even profound philosophizing about the nature of  human  consciousness  and  the  complex,  confusing  relationship  between  mind  and brain.  Hypnosis  has  been  at  the  heart  of  major  controversies  in  recent  years,  and  it continues to confound the general public who, understandably, can't readily grasp how hypnosis can be in the spotlight in cheesy stage acts (that don't seem to, but probably should,  embarrass  everyone  involved),  and  yet  it  can  be  taken  seriously  by  prominent researchers and clinicians who unequivocally declare it an effective vehicle of treatment.\nMore and more frequently, I encounter people who have had positive exposure to the applications  of  clinical  hypnosis.  There  have  been  some  wonderful  segments  showing hypnosis which have aired on popular television programs in recent years, some excellent articles describing clinical hypnosis have appeared in popular magazines, and hypnosis has  been  featured  favorably  in  a  variety  of  other  media  avenues  available  to  both  the general public and the professional community alike. As a direct result of these and other influences (such as highly respected individuals and institutions aggressively promoting its  use),  hypnosis has steadily grown in depth and breadth to become an important and more widely utilized component of the health treatment team. There is still a long way to go  in  making  hypnotic  principles  and  methods  a  part  of  most  helping  professionals' repertoire  of  fundamental  skills.  But,  my  experience  in  teaching  clinical  hypnosis  to health professionals of diverse backgrounds and interests suggests that when hypnosis is made  a  more  practical and  understandable tool, its positive use grows  and  the appreciation for its potentials spreads.",

        "text": "This book doesn't seek to sensationalize hypnosis, nor is it intended to make a statement about  how  hypnosis  is  'the  answer  to  all  of  life's  challenges.'  Rather,  hypnosis  is conceptualized  and  treated  as  a  means  of  helping  clients  develop  powerful  personal resources that can be purposefully directed toward achieving their therapeutic goals. The evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  hypnosis  is  substantial  and  ever  growing  (Kirsch, Montgomery, & Sapirstein, 1995; Lynn, Kirsch, Barabasz, Cardeña, & Patterson, 2000).\nTherapeutic  intervention  of any type  inevitably involves  skilled communication between client and clinician. Therapy's interpersonal (i.e., social) aspects are a primary focus  in  studying  hypnosis,  since  a  primary  question  we  routinely  ask  ourselves  as clinicians  is  the  one  posed  above  in  the  Vicki  vignette:  What  can  I  say  to  ease  this person's pain? Studying hypnosis teaches us a great deal about how to present ideas and how to structure interactions for maximum therapeutic benefit (J.Barber, 1991; T.Barber, 2000).\nJust  saying something with an intention to be helpful isn't enough, however. How a client  hears  what  we  say  is  an  obviously  crucial  piece  of  the  interaction.  The  study  of hypnosis  offers  substantial  insights  into how  human  beings  construct  their  individual realities, and  how  the  various intrapersonal components  of  human  experience  can  be assembled to help generate wellness at one end of the continuum and pathology at the\nother (Lynn & Sivec, 1992; Brown, 1992).\nStudying  hypnosis  will  no  doubt  change  your  understandings  of  people  and  their problems  by  encouraging  you  to  look  for  client  strengths  in  ways  you  may  not  have considered before. Acquiring skills in the use of clinical hypnosis will be an invaluable means for enhancing your clinical abilities. Integrating hypnosis into your treatment plans can allow you to obtain lasting results in the therapy work you do. Perhaps best of all, use of hypnosis can be a way to promote self-sufficiency and independence in the clients you work  with,  helping  them  to  feel  more  in  control,  resourceful,  and  self-assured  (Lynn, Kirsch, Barabasz, Cardeña, & Patterson, 2000; Schoenberger, 2000).",

        "text": "Clinical hypnosis has many different facets, each reflecting a different dimension of the phenomenon. In this book, I will primarily pay attention to the clinical context in which hypnosis  is applied. By  focusing  on  the  clinical use  of hypnotic  principles and approaches, I will be paying greater attention to the essential skills of using words and gestures in particular ways to achieve specific therapeutic outcomes. Thus, the emphasis throughout  this  text  will  be  on  the  use  of  hypnotic  processes  as  agents  of  therapeutic influence involving patterns of effective relationship and communication skills. This is not to say that hypnosis is only about the skills of the clinician, particularly when it is well established that hypnosis only happens when the client permits it and has the salient resources for it (Woody, Bowers, & Oakman, 1992; Hilgard, 1992). But, the skills of the clinician are a large part of the hypnosis equation, and these skills are the focus of this book.  The  orientation  toward  hypnosis  emphasizing  skillful  relating  to  the  client minimizes the use of ritualistic or impersonal approaches to hypnosis, instead encouraging  an  assessment  of  and  flexible  responsiveness  to  individual  client  needs. Identifying and responding to the unique attributes of each client is more demanding than adopting a  'one-size-fits-all'  approach,  and  accounts  in  large  part  for  the  considerable effort involved in becoming skilled with hypnosis. I would say the same thing, of course, about developing any clinical skill.\nMy  emphasis  throughout  will  generally  lean  heavily  in  the  direction  of  being 'practical'  and  'understandable.'  I  intend  to  present  the  concepts  and  techniques  of hypnosis in a way that will allow you to evolve clinically useful understandings. In doing so,  I  would  like  to  avoid,  whenever possible, the unanswerable philosophical questions that knowledgeable people have debated about endlessly, such as whether there is such a thing as 'reality' or whether Adam was in hypnosis when God took his rib to make Eve. Instead, I will focus on specific clinically relevant skills that can be obtained through the study of hypnotic phenomena and patterns of hypnotic communication.",

        "text": "Almost everyone has an established attitude about hypnosis. Most people have seen or heard of it,  and  whatever  they saw,  heard,  or  felt  at  the  time  left  an  impression  as  the\nbasis  for  their  attitude.  Hypnosis  has  been  demonstrated  in  movies,  kiddie  cartoons, television programs, stage shows, state fairs, and night clubs everywhere. You may have seen someone dabble in the art at parties (usually just before his lampshade-on-the-head routine). It may have caused someone you know to try to quit smoking in one of those 'instant success' programs and feel even worse when they may have failed to do so. It was rumored to be the reason that the kid in your neighborhood joined a cult. With these kind of negative exposures, it is little wonder that many people feel certain that whatever hypnosis is, it is beyond understanding…and probably dangerous.\nFor stage performers, keeping the mystery in hypnosis means more bread and butter. Unfortunately, these are the people least able to use hypnosis effectively to its greatest potential as a legitimate clinical tool for helping people improve their lives. Instead, they misrepresent  hypnosis  to  the  public,  both  layperson  and  professional,  as  an  apparent mind-controlling instrument with frightening implications. As sophisticated and enlightened as many people are becoming in many areas, change of mind seems to come a  bit  harder  in  the  field  of  hypnosis.  It  is  difficult  to  bridge  a  gap  as  wide  as  the  one between the crudeness of stage hypnosis and the refined applications of clinical hypnosis.\nFew fields have had the ups and downs hypnosis has had. Hypnosis as a recognizable phenomenon has been around, in various forms and with various names, for thousands of years. Acceptability has ranged from moderate to none. People who practiced hypnosis had their rituals ('techniques') and superstitions ('this induction worked pretty well on the last client I had with freckles…'), but they had very little scientific understanding of what they were actually doing. The assumption was that there was something inherently powerful  about  the  technique  itself,  thus  too  little  attention  was  paid  to  the  inner processes of the client or the nature of the situation in which the hypnosis was applied. With  ever-increasing  evidence  of  the  effectiveness  of  hypnosis  in  catalyzing  positive clinical outcomes, and with acceptability and applicability of hypnotic processes growing in scope as a result, the need for a sensible, understandable approach is more necessary than ever for maximizing positive exposure to the merits of hypnosis. That is a primary goal of this book.",

        "text": "The current climate for clinical practice, and the climate that will likely prevail for the foreseeable future, is one that heavily emphasizes empiricism. Clinicians in all fields are now routinely being asked to explain and justify their methods in terms of objective data attesting to the merits of their interventions. In the practice of psychotherapy, clinicians are  expected  (by  insurance  companies,  employers,  and  even  clients)  to  use  only  those methods that have a strong base of support in clinical research. Some in the field have even gone so far  as  to  promote  the  idea  of  manualizing  treatment  such  that  therapy  is performed according to a specified format developed on the basis of controlled research indicating its value.\nThe field of hypnosis has been directly influenced by the push for what are generally termed  'empirically  supported  treatments.'  In  recent  years,  substantial  high-quality\nresearch has been done in order to assess what, if anything, hypnosis can contribute to the positive  effects  of  treatment.  Thus,  a  growing  body  of  good  hypnosis  research  is becoming available to clinicians of all types, especially since this valuable research is no longer being published only in hypnosis specialty journals.\nWhat  does  the  hypnosis  research  say  about  hypnosis  as  an  empirically  supported treatment? How should we view such research? These are important questions to consider at the outset of your study of hypnosis. As you evolve your own individual conceptual framework and style for applying hypnotic approaches, you will be better equipped to determine for yourself the significance and relevance of particular research findings for your work.\nLet's  briefly  consider  the  issue  of  how  to  view  hypnosis  research  before  discussing general or specific findings. Much more will be said about these issues later, of course, but  in  this  first  chapter  it  seems  necessary  to  address  the  research  issue,  even  if  only superficially.  Let's  pose  the  question  directly:  Does  hypnosis  work,  that  is,  is  it  an effective therapy? The question seems deceptively simple, as if there should be a clear response. Unfortunately, though, the issue isn't clear because of one confounding factor: The  debate  still  goes  on  to  this  day  as  to  whether  hypnosis  should  be  considered  a therapy,  or  simply  a  therapeutic  tool  and  not  a  therapy  in  its  own  right  (American Psychological Association, 1999; Kirsch, Lynn, & Rhue, 1993). There are prestigious and persuasive advocates for both positions. For those who view hypnosis as a therapy in its own right, a therapy which employs hypnosis is termed 'hypnotherapy' and it implies that hypnosis  is  the  principal  mechanism  of  intervention.  Hypnosis  is  viewed  by hypnotherapists as a style of treatment that is as well-defined and as distinct in character as, say, behavior therapy. On the other side of the issue are those who view hypnosis as a tool  of  treatment,  integrated  into  a  larger  conceptual  and  practical  framework  that transcends  the  hypnotic  procedures  themselves.  Rather  than  hypnosis  or  suggestive procedures being 'stand alone' methods, hypnosis is used to further the aims of other, more  well  defined  interventions,  such  as  cognitive  therapy.  (It  may  seem  like  an annoying semantic issue to some, especially in the United States, but in many European countries the issue is substantial because how you define your work determines whether or not you are eligible for payment from government insurance resources.)\nWhether hypnosis enhances treatment results is not dependent on resolving the issue of whether to define hypnosis as a therapy or a therapy tool. The dividing line between a therapy and a therapy tool in this case is sufficiently ambiguous to arouse debate by the experts.  What  matters  more  is  the  growing  body  of  objective  evidence  that  when hypnosis is part of the treatment process, it generally increases the benefits of treatment (Kirsch,  Montgomery,  &  Sapirstein,  1995;  Lynn  et  al.,  2000;  Schoenberger,  2000). Hypnosis has been effectively applied in the treatment of far too many conditions and disorders to name them all, but some of the best known applications are in the domains of pain  (Chaves,  1999;  Eimer,  2000;  Montgomery,  DuHamel,  &  Redd,  2000),  anxiety (Kirsch et al., 1995; Schoenberger, 2000), post-traumatic stress disorder (Brom, Kleber, & Defare, 1989; Spiegel, 1996), depression (Yapko, 1992, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c), phobias (Crawford  &  Barabasz,  1993;  Weitzenhoffer,  2000),  children's  disorders  (Milling  & Costantino,  2000;  Olness  &  Kohen,  1996),  irritable  bowel  syndrome  (Galovski  & Blanchard, 1998; Gonsalkorale, Houghton, & Whorwell, 2002) and dissociative disorders",

Thus,  when  one  researcher  concludes  hypnosis  did  not significantly increase positive effects, or, conversely, when another researcher concludes it did, it bears more careful scrutiny by the reader to determine what kinds of procedures were used, and whether they reflected a particular style or orientation to hypnosis that enhanced or diminished the value of the findings.\nThus,  the  question,  'Does  hypnosis  work?'  is  a  complicated  question.  Is  it  the hypnosis itself that 'works,' or is it the larger treatment plan of which hypnosis is only a part that is effective? In the most general sense, though, it can be said with confidence that hypnosis helps improve treatment outcomes. That in itself justifies the time and effort it takes to learn hypnosis.",

Almost  everyone  has  had  some  direct  or  indirect  experience with  hypnosis,  and  it  is  often  incorrectly  assumed  that  whatever  I  do  with  hypnosis  is similar  to  whatever  anyone  and  everyone  else  who  uses  hypnosis  does  with  it.  Few people have had enough exposure to hypnosis to be able to differentiate the types and applications  of  hypnosis  from  one  another.  This  is  a  drawback  to  being  an  overt practitioner  of  therapeutic  hypnosis;  the  general  public  assumes  that  'hypnosis  is hypnosis is hypnosis,' and all they have to do as consumers is shop around in order to find the most inexpensive deal with the most promises attached.\nUsed skillfully, however, this problem can become an asset. By exploring the various treatment  approaches  and  possibilities  with  the  person  seeking  information  about  my work,  I  can  help  that  person  become  knowledgeable  enough  to  make  meaningful decisions.  Helping  consumers  have  the  information  necessary  to  make  an  informed decision about treat-ment should, in my opinion, be basic to any professional practice. Just because someone doesn't ask questions doesn't mean he or she has none. It usually means the person just doesn't know what to ask.\nBy involving people in a brief discussion about their needs and the nature of clinical hypnosis  as  part  of  the  treatment  process,  one  can  provide  information  that  helps consumers  more  realistically  assess  their  needs  and  the  best  means  for  meeting  them. Often, formal hypnosis (i.e., a procedure clearly defined as hypnosis) aimed at symptom removal alone is neither a desirable or realistic treatment alternative, but was turned to by the  person  for  some  'magic'  and  a  chance  to  avoid  the  maze  of  pursuing  other,  more personally challenging, approaches to treatment.\nThe fact that hypnosis is used as a stage act in the media (live shows especially, but also  in  cinema  and  television)  contributes  to  popular  stereo-types  of  hypnosis  as  a magical means for instant problem resolution through powerful suggestions. I wish I had a nickel for every person who has asked for a 'quick suggestion' to stop some unwanted behavior.

If  the  unusual  situation  arises  where  it  may  be  of  benefit  to  the  client  to not be directly  active  in  treatment,  one  might  choose  not  to  hold  an  informative  discussionoccasionally an appropriate alternative. Clarification, however, leads the person to face the fact that there will likely be no miracle cures other than the ones he or she provides for him- or herself. It means both accepting personal responsibility for the problem and being active in its resolution.\nAlmost as dangerous as the stage hypnotist in promoting misconception, perhaps even more so, is the hypnotist who, through ignorance or greed, uses hypnosis in a practice that  caters  to  public  misconception.  Such  people  usually  have  little  or  no  formal education in hypnosis and the clinical sciences, but know just enough to mislead people with claims of sensational power.\nThese  are  just  a  few  of  the  challenges  faced  by  hypnosis  as  a  field  in  its  quest  for greater visibility and appreciation.

For example, if a new co-worker is introduced to you as a patient recently released from a psychiatric unit, how will  your  perception  of  the  person  be  influenced  by  the  label  'psychiatric  patient'? Would you react to the person in the same way if no such introduction was given?\nWhen you consider a simple, concrete object, such as a chair, the tendency for labels to bias you and get in the way of open-minded experience is not so troublesome. The word 'chair'  represents  something  tangible  that  most  people  can  experience  similarly.  In considering something as abstract, complex, and subjective as 'hypnosis,' however, the difficulties  arise  almost  immediately.  The  word  represents  different  experiences  to different people, literally preventing the attainment of a precise shared meaning.\nTraditionally,  hypnosis  has  been  considered  a  subjective state of  experience  ('in hypnosis') in which the individual has capabilities or experiences generally regarded as atypical of the 'normal waking' state (Dixon & Laurence, 1992). Hypnosis has also been considered to be a process ('doing hypnosis') in which a hypnotist offers suggestions to a subject or client (Weitzenhoffer, 2000). Both of these concepts are correct, yet both are limited in using the word 'hypnosis' to describe an individual, subjective state and also a process of offering suggestions to another person.\nHypnosis as a word has been overused to the point of robbing it of any real meaning.",

As a direct result, the field of hypnosis is internally divided, much as the field of psychotherapy is internally divided (Kihlstrom, 1997; Lynn & Rhue, 1991). Different practitioners  and  researchers  each  tend  to  emphasize  a  different  facet  of  hypnosis  in striving to explain it. While  each  viewpoint  adds to our understandings of the phenomenon, they also frustrate efforts to achieve a unity within the field.\nBecause hypnosis is one word for many different kinds of experiences, most people's exposure  to  hypnosis  remains  quite  general.  The  average  person  is  led  to  believe  that 'hypnosis is hypnosis,' regardless of context. Furthermore, because the word 'hypnosis' is used for many different experiences, even helping professionals untrained in hypnosis are  skeptical  about  its  use  in  clinical  contexts,  uncertain  whether  it  differs  appreciably from the silliness demonstrated in stage shows. As you will learn, though, the context in which hypnosis is applied is ultimately what defines it and gives it substance.\nProponents of hypnosis have long recognized the difficulties in getting people to be open to its  clinical  use  when their  previous  exposure  to  hypnosis  has  only  been  to  the stage  variety.  Some  have  even  tried  to  rename  hypnosis  with  more  scientific  sounding names, yet the term 'hypnosis' remains virtually unchanged in common usage.

There are simply too many unknowns about both mind and brain,  too  many  contradictory  and  paradoxical  findings,  and  too  many  unique  and idiosyncratic  aspects of  human experience highlighted in hypnosis to develop a single, well-elaborated description of it. Moving in that idealistic direction, though, some of the leading perspectives may  help  illuminate  some  of  the  facets  of  hypnosis.  These definitions include:\n1. Hypnosis is guided daydreaming. The hypnotist, either another person (heterohypnosis) or one's self (autohypnosis, self-hypnosis) acts as a guide for an experience regarded as fantasy (Barrett, 1979).\n2. Hypnosis is a natural, altered state of consciousness. The person enters a state called 'hypnosis,' a state distinctly different from the person's 'normal' state, through a natural process which does not involve either the ingestion of any substances or other physical treatments (Tart, 1972).\n3. Hypnosis is a relaxed, hypersuggestible state. The person enters a very relaxed state of mind and body, and subsequently is less vigilant and more responsive to suggestion (Edmonston, 1991).\n4. Hypnosis is a dissociated state. The hypnotic state is considered to involve a disconnection between conscious and unconscious mental processes presumably allowing the unconscious mind to be more readily accessible and receptive to\nsuggestion (Hilgard, 1977).\nEach of the above descriptions of hypnosis contains an element of truth, but is limited in its  usefulness.  All  describe  hypnosis  from  the  standpoint  of  the  person  in  the  hypnotic state, with no mention of either the role of the hypnotist or the quality of the relationship between  the  two.  All  imply  a  passive  responsiveness  to  suggestion  on  the  part  of  the hypnotic subject, a tendency to accept offered suggestions due to the presence of a state ambiguously called 'hypnosis.' Other descriptions will be offered along with the theories of hypnosis in chapter 3, Conceptualizing Hypnosis.",

        "text": "When people think of hypnosis, they typically think of the hypnotized person behaving in unusual  and  even  paradoxical  ways  in  response  to  a  hypnotist's  suggestions.  Some theoretical models of hypnosis incorporate hypothetical constructs of the mind and human personality to explain hypnotic phenomena. Such explanations have generally been quite narrow in  their  focus  and  are  usually  bound  to  one  theoretical  view.  Perhaps  the  most obvious  example  is  a  psychoanalytic  view  of  hypnosis  as  a  transference  response involving psychological regression in which the hypnotist is responded to as a symbolic parent figure (Fromm, 1992; Nash, 1991).\nIs  there  any  compelling  reason  to  want  to  adopt  a  single  theoretical  framework  for understanding and applying clinical hypnosis? How do we distinguish between our own conceptual  framework  and  the  actual  experience  of  the  client?  The  hazard,  as  in  any clinical practice, is in not seeing phenomena that lie outside the boundaries of what you tend  to  look  for.  The  fact  that  most  clinicians  describe  themselves  as  eclectic  in orientation is an indirect statement by professionals that they want to have the freedom to do what is effective, independent of an allegiance to one specific model of intervention.\nIt  becomes  possible  to  transcend  hypothetical  considerations  of  the  structure  of  the mind or personality when you consider how you detect such structures. In other words, if there  are  detectable  structures  of  the  mind  and  personality  that  can  be  recognized  and developed into explicit theories or models, perhaps the level of consideration that is most worthwhile to study is the means by which such structures are evidenced in the person. What exactly does a client say and/or do that reveals the presence of these hypothetical structures to a clinician? The person somehow communicates them. By focusing on the client's  communications,  the  clinician  can  come  to  better  understand  something  of  the subjective  experience  of  the  client,  and  can  therefore  strive  to  better  understand  what aspect(s) of experience needs attention and intervention.\nEvery  person  who  works  with  people  in  a  clinical  capacity  makes  continuous assessments of clients' needs, motivations, skills, and limitations (Geary, 2001; Lynn et al.,  1996). Each further assesses the likelihood of success in reaching the goals of their relationship. These assessments are made in a variety of ways, not the least of which is in accordance with how the clinician chooses to conceptualize the problem from the way it is  communicated,  that  is,  the  framework  he  or  she  uses  to  organize  perceptions  while working with the client.\nYour  framework  is  your  way  of  viewing  people  and  their  problems.

Someone  who  believes  in  one  particular theory will conceptualize a problem's dynamics very differently from someone else who believes in and practices from a different theory. For example, someone with a weight problem  will  be  given  different  alternatives  and  instructed  in  different  concepts  while undergoing cognitive-behavioral treatment than will someone undergoing treatment for the same problem while undergoing psychoanalysis. Likewise, a 12-step approach to the problem will be different in structure from a medical approach.\nArguments about theoretical perspective are hard to avoid since competing views can each be credible, but they can be sidestepped to some degree when one appreciates that such arguments can not be won. No one theory to date adequately explains why people do what they do or how to intervene therapeutically in a uniformly successful way. There are hundreds of psychotherapies currently in use (Hubble, Duncan, & Miller, 1999). Each has  its  advocates,  and  each  has  at  least  anecdotal  support  in  the  literature.  Despite  the wide array of approaches for providing treatment, no therapist succeeds with all clients, perhaps  not  even  with  most.  Psychotherapy  is  able  to  help  people,  but  it  is  not  100% effective, nor is it ever likely to be, given the varied and unpredictable nature of human beings. The idealistic goal is to learn its limitations and strive to transcend them.\nThis, then, is my point: It seems to me that taking a client's communications about his or  her  problems  and  altering  them  from  their  original  form  in  order  to  fit  with  some preferred theoretical belief is a step that is both arbitrary and unnecessary. Responding to a  client's  communications  in  their  original  form  as  a  reflection  of  what  the  person  is experiencing can lead you to communicate in a more meaningful way that can enhance the quality of the interaction.\nThe  approach  to  hypnosis  promoted  in  this  book  is  essentially  a  way  of  organizing your  therapeutic  communications  to  best  fit  an  individual's  needs,  using  words  and gestures  selectively  in  order  to  arrive  at  some  worthwhile  outcome.  Which  therapeutic framework you choose to work from is not an issue here. All the therapeutic approaches work some time with somebody, which is why each has devotees. The clinical skill lies in knowing which approach to use at any given moment.\nThe client  who  senses  being  understood  by  the  clinician  is  the  client  more  likely  to benefit from the relationship. Of course, this is not an original idea, for every clinician is trained  to  appreciate  the  importance  of  the  quality  of  the  relationship  with  the  client. Literature  in  hypnosis  and  psychotherapy  generally  employs  the  word  'rapport'  to describe the ideal positive interrelationship between hypnotist/clinician and client. How one  attained  rapport  was  left  up  to  the  individual  clinician,  as  it  must  be,  but  such noticeable  lack  of  consideration  has  resulted  in  a  de-emphasis  of  the  interpersonal components of effective clinical hypnosis. Consequently, rigid approaches that pay little heed to specific individual differences between people have flourished. A global 'low' or 'high' hypnotizable label doesn't count as an assessment of an individual's capabilities, in my opinion.\nThe  process  of  clinical intervention can  correctly be  described  as  a series of communications between a clinician and client. No matter what your orientation, you are using  the  communications  of  the  client  to  make  assessments,  and  you  are  using communications as the vehicle for delivering your therapy.

In producing a beneficial result, the client's experience matters, the clinician's skills matter, and the relationship between them and the context in which they interact matter.\nThe  essence  of  what  I  am  discussing  here  is  communication  and  interpersonal influence,  and  that  is  precisely  where  hypnosis  comes  in.  If  one  rejects  the  passive, exclusively intrapersonal view of hypnosis as only an individual's subjective state, and instead  considers  the  dynamics  of  interpersonal  communication  a  skilled  clinician employs in order to influence a client to have a suggested therapeutic experience, then a rich and complex new world opens up. Somewhere in the interpersonal communications of  the  client  and  clinician  are  some  components  that  enable  a  client's  subjective experience to be altered and  therapeutic influence to take place. Hypnosis,  like psychotherapy,  involves  multiple  components  on  multiple  dimensions  in  order  to  be effective (T.Barber, 2000; Evans, 2000).\nTo  use  your  words  and  gestures  skillfully  in  the  deliberate  creation  of  therapeutic experiences for an individual in distress (or any other person one would want a specific outcome  with)  is  the  'nuts  and  bolts'  of  what  hypnosis  is  all  about.  Approaching hypnosis from this standpoint places emphasis on being an effective communicator, one who  is  able  to  recognize  and  competently  relate  and  respond  meaningfully  to  the communications of others.\nWhen  you  shift  the  focus  away  from  mere  techniques  to  consider  dimensions  of communication  that  increase  the  potential  for  influencing  another  person's  experience, the emphasis is much less on ritual or attaining particular levels (i.e., depths) of hypnosis, and much more on the use of words and gestures in specific ways. Thus, elements of any piece  of  communication  can  have  hypnotic  qualities  associated  with  them  without formally  being  called  'hypnosis' (Watzlawick,  1985;  Zeig  &  Rennick,  1991).  Simply put, you don't have to incorporate the rituals of hypnosis in order to be hypnotic in your wording or demeanor. Even if you were to choose not to pursue expertise in doing formal hypnosis in your clinical practice, you can still benefit greatly from learning about the power of effective communication through the study of hypnotic approaches.",

        "text": "More often than should be the case, in my opinion, clinicians see themselves as separate from their interactions with their clients. They may think they can ask questions without influencing the quality of the answers they get, or they may think they can be neutral in avoiding  offering  direct  advice  when  asked  for  some.  There  are  even  those  who genuinely believe that when they do hypnosis with someone, they are simply elicitingnot  directing-the  client's  hypnotic  talents.  They  do  not  see  themselves  as  playing  a significant role in what surfaces at all. I find that incredible, and it greatly concerns me. How can you be conscious of using your skills deliberately and with integrity if you deny you have any influence?\nIt  is  an  important  starting  point  in  studying  hypnosis  to  recognize  the  ever-present nature of interpersonal influence. In studying the fascinating realm of social psychology in particular, you learn almost right away that influence is inevitable simply by your being\nthere . Think about this statement: 'You will do things when you are by yourself that you will  not  do  if  even  one  other  person  is  around.'  The  mere  presence  of  another  person alters your behavior. It is not a question of whether you will influence your client-you undoubtedly will-but rather a question of how you will influence him or her. Learning to use patterns of influence responsibly while respecting the integrity of those we work with is a demanding challenge. After all, an insensitively used word can hinder or prevent a  positive  treatment result. Likewise, a sensitively used phrase can engender a positive belief that dramatically  improves  the  chances  for  a  successful  treatment  outcome (McNeilly & Brown, 1994).\nPatterns of influence do not just exist in the contexts of therapy or hypnosis, though. If you  are  observant,  you  will  see  them  literally  everywhere  you  see  social  interaction. When you learn to recognize hypnotic elements in everyday situations, it will help you to use hypnosis more naturally, flexibly, and with greater success.",

Before I do, let me pose a question to you: Do you believe that people in general and clients in particular  are  'sick'  and  need  to  be  healed,  or  do  you  believe,  despite  their  problems, they are basically all right and can be helped to be even better?\nThere is a growing movement in the field of psychology, largely catalyzed by Martin E.P.Seligman, Ph.D., a noted researcher and former Presi-dent of the American Psychological Association. Seligman challenged the field to focus less on the pathologies of  humankind  and  to  focus  more  on  increasing  its  strengths-for  example,  loyalty, compassion, generosity, perseverance, and so on. Seligman called for the development of what has come to be called a 'positive psychology,' whose mission would be to research, characterize, and teach those principles that lead to better adjusted individuals, communities, and institutions (Seligman, 2002; Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).\nSeligman  did  not  originate the concept  of studying what's right with people. Significant luminaries like Milton H.Erickson, Abraham Maslow, Virginia Satir, and Carl Rogers  all  called  for  developing  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  best  parts  of  human experience. But Seligman has been particularly effective in turning an abstract goal into a domain  of  well-defined  research  that  has  the  potential  to  offer  much  more  than inspiration alone.",

Key  considerations  in  doing  therapy  are determining what dimension of a person's experience you want to amplify in his or her awareness, and why you want to amplify it. If I'm going to ask you, 'So, how do you feel about that?' and thereby encourage you to focus on and amplify your feelings, is there a sound therapeutic rationale for doing so, or am I just doing a technique out of habit?\nHypnosis generally focuses on and amplifies people's strengths. Hypnosis begins with the premise that the client has valuable abilities that are present but hidden, abilities that can  be  uncovered  and  used  in  a  deliberate  way  to  overcome  symptoms  and  problems (Lankton,  2001;  Yapko,  2001  c).  Hypnosis  starts  with  a  belief  that  people  are  more resourceful  than  they  realize.  When  a  clinician  helps  a  client  discover  the  ability  to manage  pain  without  drugs;  helps  a  client  discover  the  ability  to  move  comfortably through situations that used to cause panic, or helps a client develop the ability to shift his or her focus onto more of what's right instead of only what's wrong, and reduces his or her despair in the process; such a clinician is connecting with and enhancing the strongest and healthiest parts of those clients (Lankton & Lankton, 1983; J.Barber, 1991). Can you focus on symptoms and address the negative factors in people's lives? Of course, and to be therapeutic you have to, at least some of the time. But, the greater issue is one of how your  beliefs  and  methods  serve  to  increase  or  decrease  your  chances  of  noticing  and amplifying what's right with people.\nIs the goal of treatment to reduce pathology, or to expand wellness? How you answer this question will help determine much of your reaction to the material in this book, and will shape how you ultimately use hypnosis in your own practice. Whatever your answer may be right now, though, I hope your study of hypnosis will gradually highlight for you the wisdom of evolving a positive psychology that can help inform your understandings of yourself and the people you treat.",

        "text": "The interpersonal process of clinical hypnosis can be viewed as a complex interaction in which  the  qualities  of  your  relationship  and  communications  with  your  client  help determine  their  eventual  worth  in  treatment.  As  a  clinician,  you  use  hypnosis  to  focus clients  on  important  aspects  of  their  experience  that  can  serve  as  resources,  and  you introduce to them what you hope and expect will be helpful possibilities (e.g., new ideas, helpful skills, etc.). Even those clinicians who think of hypnosis as something that only happens within the person find themselves in the position of saying and doing things to guide their clients to develop their internal resources (Spiegel & Spiegel, 1987).\nBy describing the hypnotic interaction in broader social terms of communication and influence,  much  of  the  mystery  of  'hypnotic  power'  can  be  eliminated.  The  more  we learn about what makes for good clinical hypnosis, the more we come to recognize that the  important  skills  to  have  as  a  good  hypnotist  are  the  same  ones  needed  to  be  an effective clinician. These include an ability to establish a strong therapeutic alliance and positive expectations for treatment; flexibility and a willingness to experiment with new ideas,  perceptions,  and  behaviors;  and  many  other  equally  important  abilities  (Haley, 1973; Hubble, Duncan, & Miller, 1999; Kirsch, 1990).\nClinical hypnosis with both intra- and interpersonal emphases on creating a context for therapeutic influence is a meaningful perspective with a great deal to offer professional communicators.  It  brings  into  harmony  the  extensive  research  and  clinical  literature which  make  good  cases  for  seemingly  contradictory  viewpoints  by  emphasizing  their common denominators of a shared relationship, a specific context, and individual abilities each person brings to the interaction (Bowers & Davidson, 1991; Spanos, 1991).",

People do not know they may be misinformed until their existing information and beliefs come into direct conflict with some new information. The clinical implication of this point is that it is especially important to spend time with clients discussing directly or indirectly their  views  and  expectations  about  the  therapeutic  relationship.  Only  through  such discussion can a clinician discover the client's expectations, needs, and wishes in order to assess whether they are realistic and to evolve a means for incorporating them into the therapy (Duncan, Miller, & Coleman, 2001; McNeilly, 2001).",

        "text": "In  the  practice  of  clinical  hypnosis,  the  opportunity  for  dealing  with  misinformation  is constant.  Most  misconceptions  people  hold  are  predictable,  which  can  make  their identification  and  rebuttal  easier.  The  single  most  common  misperception  that  people seem to hold is that hypnosis is a powerful form of mind control in which the hypnotized person  has  no  free  will.  Most  of  the  other  common  misconceptions  are  based  on  that erroneous notion of surrendering one's will (Frauman, Lynn, & Brentar, 1993).\nIt is difficult to change  people's thinking when  they  are  convinced  they  are knowledgeable in their opinions. In fact, the more knowledgeable a person views him- or herself, the more difficult it is to introduce conflicting information (Zimbardo & Leippe, 1992). In general, people ignore contradictions or twist them around until everything they believe fits together comfortably, even if incorrectly. I had what seemed to me to be my ten thousandth experience of this recently when I was unable to convince an obstetrician that hypnosis would not be harmful to his pregnant patient who requested hypnosis for reducing stress and increasing her physical comfort during pregnancy. I pointed out ways that  hypnosis  would,  in  fact,  be  helpful  to  her,  and  though  he  could  agree  at  an intellectual  level,  he  could  not  bring  himself  to  give  her  permission  to  experience hypnosis, so strong were his fears and doubts. Instead of empowering his patient to strive to  enhance  her  own  experience,  he  unintentionally  reinforced  the  idea  that  she  should have doubts about her own resources. With many people, unfortunately, the predominant attitude is, 'Don't bother me with facts, my mind is made up!' Too often, the client is the one who suffers and loses an opportunity for improvement.\nInvolving the client in a direct discussion about his or her beliefs and expectations for the hypnotic and psychotherapeutic experience is necessary to make certain he or she is knowledgeable enough to make sensible treatment decisions (Scheflin, 2001). Since the client's understanding of the therapy process may be inaccurate, incomplete, or both, the ethical and competent professional can provide the person with as much information as he or she may require in order to be fully involved in the process in a cooperative and positive way. You may note that I say that as much information should be provided as the person 'requires,' implying that on some occasions the amount of information dispensed may be marginal, while in other instances it is substantial. Individual client needs differ, and only by communicating clearly with your client will you discover his or her needs. Generally, though, a well-informed client is in a better position to make therapy a more meaningful collaboration (Lynn, Kirsch, & Rhue, 1996).\nMany clinicians are helpful in reaction to questions and concerns the client raises, but this  may  be  only  a  portion  of  what  is  required  in  order  for  the  client  to  be  positively involved in the treatment. The client is sometimes too self-conscious to ask questions of the  clinician,  and  the  risk  of  seeming  ignorant  in  addition  to  already  having  presented one's self as experiencing problems that are out of control and in need of professional help is a risk too great for some to take. The result is a silent hope that the clinician is skilled enough to read minds and take the necessary steps to effect a cure with as little self-disclosure and involvement as possible on the part of the client. Another facet of the concern for providing information to the client whether or not you are asked for it is the observation  that  many  people  simply  don't  know  what  to  ask.  If  a  client  already  feels",

But, if hypnosis is something totally new to the client, he or she may not know what questions to ask the clinician. Only a gentle inquiry will help you decide what this person might need to know.\nThe hazard of not giving the client enough information is matched by the hazard of giving too much information to a client who is not ready for it or wanting it. A favorite story of mine illustrates the point: A boy about six years old came home from one of his first days at school and with an aura of great intensity asked his mother, 'Mommy, where did I come from?' The mother got a pained look on her face, took a deep sigh and said 'Well, I had desperately hoped we wouldn't have to have this talk for a few more years yet, but since you've asked I may as well tell you. The psychologist on the talk show said that if you're old enough to ask, you're old enough to know.' The mother proceeded to explain  the  'facts  of  life'  in  vivid  detail,  describing  anatomical  differences  between males and females, the process of intercourse, the fertilization process, pregnancy, and finally the birth process. The little boy sat unmoving and wide-eyed while listening to his mother throughout the entire explanation. Finally, the mother completed her explanation and asked her son, 'Does that answer your question?' The boy replied, 'No, mommy, it doesn't. My friend Mitchell says he comes from Detroit. Where did I come from?'",

Some basic questions that have been useful for me to ask are: Have you ever had experience with hypnosis before? Was it personal experience or was it something you saw, read, or heard about? What impression did you form? What leads you to believe it might be helpful to you?\nIf the client has had personal experience with hypnosis, good questions to ask might include:  What  was  the  situation  in  which  you  experienced  hypnosis?  Who  was  the hypnotist and what were his or her qualifications? What was the explanation given to you about  hypnosis  at  the  time?  What  was  the  specific  technique  used  with  you?

Unless you specifically ask about prior experience, you run the risk of duplicating past negative  experiences.  Why?  The  client's  associations  to  that  approach  are  negative.

        "text": "How stage hypnotists get their subjects to perform is not difficult to understand if you have  an  appreciation  both  of  hypnotic  principles  and  of  certain  aspects  of  human behavior perhaps best described in the literature of social psychology. Let's consider how it's done.\nStage  shows  formally  begin  with  a  call  for  volunteers.  The  volunteers  are  asked  to come up on the stage only if they 'truly want to be hypnotized.' Some stage hypnotists\nare  so  well  known  that  volunteers  eagerly  make  themselves  available  as  soon  as  the opportunity  arises,  literally  rushing  to  the  stage  to  offer  themselves.  When  a  stage hypnotist gets volunteers, he or she knows several things about these people with a high level of certainty:\n1. They are aware of what they are volunteering for, and thus are probably willing to perform as directed. There is an exception to this discussed shortly.\n2. A general trait common to volunteer performers is some degree of exhibitionism; the greater the degree, the more useful the subject. Someone shy and introverted is unlikely to go on stage to perform before a crowd. If someone shy were to go on stage, one of two things would probably occur: Either the person would 'let loose' and consider hypnosis responsible  for  his  or  her  behavior,  or  the  person  would  fail  the  hypnotist's  tests  for determining  subject  acceptability  and  be  returned  to  the  audience.  For  the  most  part, however, the people who go on stage to become a part of the show are fully aware of what  their  role  will  be.  In  volunteering  they  are  actively  seeking  the  role  and  are agreeable to carry out its demands. You may notice my use of the word 'role.' There is a well-defined script the hypnotist creates for the volunteer subject to follow, even though to the members of the audience it all seems so spontaneous. It's why the faces and names of  hypnotic  subjects  change  from  show  to  show,  but  not  the  routines  themselves. Undeniably and invariably, the volunteer subject knows what is expected and agrees to provide it.\n3. The experienced stage hypnotist also knows that some individuals are volunteering to participate with the 'hidden agenda' of proving to the hypnotist that he or she is not omnipotent. Others are intent on proving to themselves that their personal will is strong, evidenced by the inability of the hypnotist to 'control' them. Insecure people may have their  fragile  self-esteem  temporarily  boosted  by  an inability to  be  hypnotized  if  they interpret it as 'having too strong a will.'\nIn order to discover which subjects are entertaining performers and which are the ones intent  on  'proving  themselves'  through  noncooperative  behavior,  the  hypnotist  next administers a series of structured hypnotic suggestibility tests to the group of volunteers. This may be done off stage while the audience waits, or may be done on stage with the lights dimmed so the audience isn't privy to the conditioning process of the volunteers. Suggestibility tests are discussed in greater detail in a later chapter, but are defined here simply as brief hypnotic interactions that can reveal the degree to which the subject will likely  respond  to  the  hypnotist's  suggestions.  The  stage  hyp-notist  does  a  focusing technique or induction, then offers suggestions of specific feelings and behaviors, such as 'You can't open your eyes.' The most responsive subjects are kept on stage to be used in the show, and the others are told to return to their seats in the audience. Typically, the hypnotist offers an indirect suggestion to those remaining on stage about how good and responsive they are as subjects by stating directly to those dismissed from the stage how unfortunate it is that they were not (open, secure, smart…) enough to succeed as hypnotic subjects. What does that kind of insult do to the rejected person's self-esteem? One can't be certain, but nothing positive seems possible from such an interaction.\nAt  this  point,  where  the  subjects  have  now  been  chosen,  the  pressure  to  perform becomes very intense. The subjects have been chosen for whatever qualities (primarily obedience)  they  possess  that  will  help  put  on  a  good  show.  There  is  a  great  deal  of\npressure to meet the expectations of the hypnotist, the expectations of the crowd, and, not least,  of  themselves.  The  pressure  is  to  be  successful,  and success  in  this  context  is directly proportional to the level of obedience displayed. Now that the subjects have been chosen and motivated to obey, the show can go on. From the perspective of the audience, the show is ready to begin, but from the hypnotist's perspective, the work for the night is essentially over! Subjects have been properly conditioned to comply, and now the show becomes a matter of simply running them through 'tricks.'\nThe hypnotist has cultivated almost unquestioned cooperation in the subject by running the  person  through  tests  and  then  'passing'  him  or  her,  in  essence  telling  the  subject, 'You are the person I want here because I know you will do as I suggest.' The literature of social psychology calls attention to how much more valuable a position of membership or a relationship is viewed by someone if it is difficult for him or her to attain it. Being accepted as a demonstration subject is a position you have to earn. It is not one given charitably.\nThe  audience  expects  the  hypnotic  subject  to  behave  in  particular  ways,  just  as  the subjects themselves know they will be 'made' to act in certain entertaining ways. When a group of people have an expectation of how one is supposed to act, a temporary social norm  is  established.  Deviation  from  a  norm  in  almost  any  situation  is  generally undesirable, and the strong sense of independence it takes not to conform to the norm (the expected behavior) in the stage show context is virtually absent in the chosen subjects. Research  on  the  need  for  peer  approval  and  its  relationship  to  the  phenomenon  of conformity describes this concept clearly (Bordens & Horowitz, 2002). Thus, conforming behavior in order to get hypnotist and audience approval is a major ingredient in the stage show formula.\nTo appreciate the lengths to which the perceived desirability of conforming will drive someone, you may find it helpful to review some of the literature on conformity. (Some of this is described in chapter 6.) You will discover that the need to conform to others' expectations  has  led  research  subjects  to  express  obviously  incorrect  judgments,  adopt others' perceptions of ambiguous events, and even to comply with mistrusted authorities. Compromising  one's  self  even  in  potentially  damaging  situations  is  possible  if  the rewards for doing so are viewed as worthwhile enough. Witness the number of people seriously injured doing hazardous stunts or the number  of people subjected to embarrassing and even disgusting circumstances while looking for just a brief moment's exposure on national television.\nIn a situation like a hypnosis stage show, where the subject is confident he or she will not be injured, being the center of attention and the source of a large group's amusement may  be  reward  enough  to  justify  complying  with  the  hypnotist's  suggestions.  Any negative side-effects (e.g., embarrassment, self-recriminations) from the performance can be readily attributed to the hypnosis, and not to the subject him- or herself.\nResearch  consistently  shows  that  people  are  far  more  willing  to  take  risks,  exercise questionable judgment, and even hurt others when they are not held accountable for their actions. If someone else assumes responsibility, or the person can act anonymously, or some other  factor  (such  as  alcohol  or  hypnosis)  is  a  viable  alibi,  then  inhibitions  may diminish  or  even  disappear  (Spivey  &  Prentice-Dunn,  1990).  Hypnosis  is  made  the culprit for silly behavior, and the subject is free to act 'as if' out of personal control. It is\nto the hypnotist's advantage to maintain this illusion, for if the subject appears to not be maintaining  personal  control,  then  it  must  be  the  hypnotist  who  is  in  control  of  the subject.  This  conclusion  on  the  part  of  the  audience  is  the  very  perception  of  special power the hypnotist strives to foster. It's all a part of the act, and it is very convincing for most people.\nLast, but not least, the expectations the subject has toward him- or herself are involved in this process. The smart hypnotist uses the person's desire for a positive self-image by making  the  subject's  positive  self-image  contingent  on  carrying  out  the  suggestions. Essentially, the hypnotist is saying, 'Smart (secure, strong, successful…) people respond in this way to this suggestion. Now, how are you going to respond?' Unless you want to be  viewed  by  yourself  and  others  negatively,  you  will  likely  respond  in  the  suggested manner. People generally want to succeed, not fail; in this context, success is defined as following the given suggestions to the letter.\nAll the forces described here are working on the subject in the hypnotist's favor. The competent stage hypnotist, before giving any suggestions at all, knows all these things and knows that if all the pressures to perform are developed carefully and used properly, the subject will be most cooperative. If the pressures to perform have not been developed and used well, or if a suggestion is perceived by the subject as too threatening to carry out, the subject is unlikely to respond as well to the hypnotist.\nThe structure of the suggestions given to stage show subjects is another factor in the apparent ease with which the hypnotist seems to control his or her subjects. The typical layperson in the audience does not understand how saying, 'You wouldn't forget your name,  would  you?'  can  induce  someone  to  forget  her  name.  This  is  an  example  of 'indirect  negative  suggestion,'  which  carries  the  hypnotist's  requests  in  a  more  subtle form  but  is  recognizable  all  the  same.  Suggestions  for  an  inability  to  remember  being hypnotized  (i.e.,  amnesia)  are  typically  given  in  the  same  covert  way,  furthering  the illusion  that  the  hypnotist  has  control  of  the  subject's  mind.  These  and  other  types  of suggestions are described in later chapters.\nAt all times, the subject is fully able to refuse to accept suggestions should he or she choose to. Given the great amount of personal and situational pressure to accept them, however, this capacity is  rarely  used.  It  is  actually  easier  just  to  go  ahead  and  comply than it is to refuse; it takes more energy and inner drive to actively reject a suggestion than it does to passively comply and then blame hypnosis as responsible. The subject is able to reject the hypnotist's suggestions, but for the reasons given typically chooses not to.\nStage hypnotists are, as a group, skilled in their use of hypnosis. In fact, many of the principles  and  techniques  of  stage  hypnosis  are  nearly  identical  to  those  of  clinical hypnosis.  Only  the  application  is  different.  I  can  respect  their  skills  and  knowledge  in hypnosis, but I must admit I have strong negative feelings about their chosen application. Using something potentially beneficial to people in a misleading and even degrading way seems  unethical  and  I  believe  should  be  discouraged.  Many  people  who  could  benefit from hypnosis and many clinicians who could use hypnosis to help their clients will not seek  out  hypnosis  as  a  therapeutic  alternative.  They  cannot  even  begin  to  comprehend how what they have seen in a night club show can be used clinically to help someone in distress, and they just don't want the 'baggage.'\nColleagues of mine have presented an opposing viewpoint, namely that many people seek out hypnosis in therapy because of the stage hypnotist. That may well be true, but such people are more likely to believe that hypnotists have mysterious powers. So, they approach  treatment  unrealistically,  an  undesirable  consequence.  Stage  hypnosis  and  its negative connotations rob good people in need of help of what could be a valuable choice as  a  treatment  alternative  by  promoting  misconception  and mystery. The entertainment value gets lost for me as a result.\nThere are those who have suggested that in the same way stage hypnosis is primarily an  artifact  of  compliance,  so  might  hypnosis  in  the  clinical  context  be  an  artifact  of compliance. In chapter 6 I will discuss this along with other social psychological issues pertaining to hypnosis, but suffice it to say here that the research evidence  is unambiguous  in  its  conclusion  that  hypnosis  involves  much,  much  more  than  mere compliance.  When  some-one  generates  physiological  changes  or  shifts  in  perceptions, there  is  something  else  going  on  of  a  greater  magnitude  that  represents  the  essence  of hypnosis (Dixon & Laurence, 1992; Orne, 1959).\nHaving a good understanding of how stage hypnosis works will be invaluable to you in terms  of  understanding  dynamics  of  influence  and  assisting  you  in  dealing  with  the general public's fears and doubts about hypnosis. Addressing misconceptions directly is the subject of the next major section of this chapter.",

It  should highlight to you the recognition that different people respond differently to direction and uncertainty,  an  important  observation  relevant  to  doing  clinical  hypnosis.  The  issue  of 'control' surfaces immediately.\nTaking the time to identify and correct misconceptions can help you sidestep the issue of control, particularly if you emphasize the natural qualities of hypnosis through the use of common examples taken directly from the client's everyday experience (e.g., driving while absorbed in thought, getting deeply immersed in imagination). Furthermore, you can reinforce for the client the virtually total self-control the hypnotized person maintains during the experience of hypnosis (Lynn, Rhue, & Weekes, 1990).\nClinicians  need  to  be  sensitive  to  the  issue  of  control  and  respond  to  it  in  some meaningful way, either directly or indirectly. Avoiding the issue of control can increase the  anxiety  of  an  already  uncertain  client, and  may  generate  a  force  ('resistance')  that works  against  the  aims  of  treatment.  If  a  client  fears  an  imminent  loss  of  control,  the typical result is a 'power struggle' with the clinician. Would you want to be hypnotized if you thought you would lose control of yourself? The sensible goal in therapy is to do all you can to avoid a power struggle and define the relationship as a cooperative one. After all,  there  is  really  no  way  to  win a  power struggle with the client. To defeat your very best efforts, all he or she has to do is… nothing!",

        "text": "Using the power struggle, and any other interpersonal factors that arise for that matter, as a  hypnotic  device  to  enhance  the  therapy  is  possible  when  you  recognize  the  paradox present in hypnosis and psychotherapy. Jay Haley (1963) described this paradox in terms of the hypnotist's seemingly contradictory messages: 'I can only hypnotize you by you hypnotizing  yourself;  I  can  only  help  you  by  you  helping  yourself.'  Essentially,  the message emphasizes the responsibility and control on the part of the client, but which is shared with the clinician. If I say to you, 'Here. I'm giving you control of me,' then who is really in control? If I have the control to give you control, then all I am really doing is suspending  my  decision  to  exercise  my  choices  and  instead  use  yours.  I  remain  free, though, to begin exercising my choices again at any time I either have to or want to.\nIf you have ever been involved in a group decision-making process, you may think of the  dynamics  in  that  situation  as  analogous  to  what  takes  place  in  the  hypnotic interaction.  If  it  seems  unnecessary  to  express  your  opinion  because  others  are  already acting in a way that is consistent with your beliefs, then you are less likely to make any further contributions to a system that is already working in a desirable way. If the group acts in ways contrary to your belief system, however, you can either: (1) go along with them  peacefully  but  not  really  internalize  their  beliefs;  (2)  resist  and  contradict  them overtly; or, (3) you can resist covertly in a passive-aggressive manner. If you choose to just go along, you have control of yourself, but that control is not overtly expressed by choice in order to avoid contradictory encounters.\nThe client in hypnosis, likewise, is free to overtly or covertly reject suggestions that don't  fit  for whatever reason.  So,  even  though  the  client  seems  to  be  saying,  'Control me,' the clinician can appreciate that control of the client is not his or hers to assume. Rather, the  responsibility  of  the  clinician  is  to  structure  suggestions  responsibly  and competently to maximize the likelihood that they will be accepted and translated into a therapeutic change . There  is never  a guarantee  that even  the most  well-formed suggestion will be accepted and acted upon. Sensitivity to the client's unique needs only increases the probability.\nThe role of choice in the hypnotic encounter cannot be overemphasized. Hypnosis has occasionally been accused of making good people do bad things, but such accusations do not consider realistically the choices the individual made (or didn't make, which is also a choice). At  any  given  time,  a  person  in  hypnosis  is  in  a  position  to  choose  to  lighten, deepen, maintain, or end the experience. You cannot be forced to focus your attention, dissociate  and  respond,  the  core  components  of  hypnosis.  You  may  choose  to  suspend judgment or decision-making, but that is a choice and not a surrendering of your will.",

There  is  usually  also  an appropriate sense of concern, even fear, that they will be developing powers they might 'lose control' of to someone else's detriment. Developing skills in hypnosis presupposes a  directive  style  (i.e.,  taking  responsibility  for  initiating  and  guiding  the  course  of therapy),  and  there  arises  for  some  students  the  issue  of  how  they  will  deal  with  the 'power'  they  think  they  will  obtain  from  studying  hypnosis.  For  some,  the  ability  to direct  another  person's  experience  is  used  in  self-serving  ways,  evidenced  in  arbitrary demonstrations of power by requiring the 'subject' to respond to such degrading things as  finger-snaps.  Usually,  I  become  aware  of  the  concerns  in  a  more  positive  way, however, when students express their thoughts and feelings about developing hypnotic skills in the course of training.\nAs  you  become  more  experienced  with  hypnosis,  the  issues  of  power  from  the clinician's  standpoint  become  less  prominent.  Actual  experience  with  hypnosis  will demonstrate to you quickly and repeatedly that your suggestions can be, and often will be, rejected. Any sense of omnipotence you might naively begin with is rapidly lost, a fortunate  outcome  of  failure.  The  fear  of  losing  control  of  the  hypnosis  and  of  the hypnotized  client  comes  to  be  recognized  as  an  unnecessary  concern,  since  control  is ultimately  maintained  by  the  client.  Adopting  this  view  affords  you  the  comfort  of knowing that even if and when a client reacts in unexpected ways, the person is choosing (at some level) to do so and your role is to be as supportive and helpful as possible.",

        "text": "Most stage hypnotists are skilled at creating the illusion that they possess a magical and mysterious  power  over  other  people.  The  communication  and  contextual  variables  of stage  hypnosis  were  detailed  earlier  in  this  chapter,  and  through  the  systematic  and deliberate manipulation of these variables the hypnotist attains and maintains the illusion of  power.  In  the  clinical  context,  the  clinician  is  able  to  use  his  or  her  skills  in communication to make acceptance of suggestions more likely, but there is no control over the client other than the control the client gives to the clinician. The hypnotist directs the client's experience, but only to the degree that the client permits it. It is a relationship of mutual responsiveness.\nHypnosis involves concentration on some stimulus (such as the clinician's words or the client's  own  internal  associations).  When  used  formally,  hypnosis  usually  involves  a relaxation  process  as  well.  You  cannot  force  someone  to  concentrate  or  relax;  thus, technically, entering hypnosis is a personal choice. Even in the use of covert or indirect techniques,  people  are  capable  of  resisting  having  their  attention  directed.  Without  the client's cooperation on some level, the likelihood of therapeutic gain is greatly reduced or eliminated. Allowing the client to feel accepted, understood, and likely to be helped is important for that reason.\nRealistically, the clinician is given power by the average client because of his or her title,  education,  reputation,  etc.  That  power  can  be  given  suspiciously  or  openly  as  an indicator of the level of trust involved. If the clinician were truly in absolute control, then treatment results would be uniformly successful. It is because the client is in control that treatment results vary so much from individual to individual. The clinician is a guide for the  experience,  but  the  client  permits  that  role  and  thus  is  the  ultimate  check  in  the process (T.Barber, 1969; Lynn, Rhue, & Weekes, 1990; Zeig, 2001).",

        "text": "This  is  a  tricky  issue,  and  pertains  primarily  to  the  induction  of  formal  hypnosis.  In theory, almost anyone can be hypnotized, whether directly or indirectly. Even the people whom  many  clinicians  claim  are  unhypnotizable  or  'low'  hypnotizables  (such  as depressed  individuals)  can,  in  fact,  experience  hypnosis  to  some  degree,  however slightly, but will require the use of specialized techniques (Bányai, 1991; Spanos, 1991).\nIn  practice,  there  is  a  spectrum  of  responsiveness  in  people  ranging  from  what  are\ngenerally termed 'low' hypnotizables to 'high' hypnotizables to 'very high' hypnotizables, sometimes referred to as the 'hypnotic virtuosos' (Hilgard, 1977). These are  designations  based  on  responses  to  formal  tests  of  hypnotizability  (described  in chapter 11). Clearly there are some people in whom it is more difficult to induce hypnosis than in others. What that means exactly is the subject of considerable debate within the field. Does it mean the person has some inherent limitation (e.g., a genetically or perhaps neurologically defined capacity for hypnosis), or might it mean that the test protocol used to assess hypnotizability  somehow  'misses  the  mark'  for  the  person?  There  are experienced  and  bright  people  arguing  for  each  side  (Cohen,  1989;  Lynn  &  Shindler, 2002).\nThe  issue  is  a  critically  important  one,  because  if  you  conclude  a  person  isn't hypnotizable  due  to  some  innate  limitation,  then  there  is  no  need  for  you  to  continue trying. If you believe those persons deemed 'lows' are not significantly less capable than others, but may be less responsive for any of a wide range of reasons (e.g., fear of losing control,  inability  to  distinguish  ambiguous  internal  states  such  as  tension  or  relaxation, fear of impending change, negative situational factors, etc.), then you may strive to find and  resolve  the  point(s)  diminishing  the  person's  responsiveness.  Can  the  'difficult' person be transformed from a poor hypnotic subject into a reasonably responsive one? Many  experienced  clinicians  and  researchers  would  say  yes  (Gfeller,  1993;  Wagstaff, 1996).",

        "text": "In some of the literature addressing this issue, there are often statistical averages provided describing  what  percentage  of  the  population  can  reach  a  given  level  of  hypnosis,  and even what percentage of the population cannot be hypnotized at all.  For example, one such source states that of 'normal adults,' 5% cannot go into hypnosis at all, 95% can attain a light level of hypnosis, 55% can attain a medium level, and only 20% are capable of attaining a deep level of hypnosis (these figures appeared in the American Society of Clinical  Hypnosis'  Syllabus  on  Hypnosis  and  Handbook  of  Therapeutic  Suggestions, 1973. There are many other, differing estimates).\nWhen a clinician states that any percentage of the population cannot be hypnotized, the responsibility  to  obtain  the  greatest  results  possible  is  taken  from  the  clinician.  When someone has difficulty experiencing hypnosis using some standardized (i.e., impersonal) procedure, he or she may be dismissed as 'one of those impossible types.' That takes the clinician off the hook for having to be more responsible for making greater effort to reach that person-and other 'difficult' clients as well.\nStatistical averages for hypnotizability are not particularly helpful to a clinician, in my opinion,  despite  their  necessity  in  research  contexts.  They  say  too  little  about  a  given individual's capacity for experiencing hypnosis, and they predict too little about clinical outcomes. Furthermore, they are derived under circumstances that have little bearing on the therapeutic interaction. The figures are based on getting a sample of research subjects, running each of them through a standardized procedure as required by research, and then determining  how  many  of  them  were  able  to  demonstrate  behavior  thought  to  be associated with specific levels of hypnosis. The flaws in such studies are numerous:\n(1) The most serious fault of such hypnotizability studies is that standardized induction procedures  do  not  recognize  individual  differences  in  subjects.  Assessing  individual differences and then specifically forming suggestions on the basis of those differences is the most fundamental prerequisite for successful clinical hypnosis in my view. Using the same technique with each person without variation is one way of assuring failure with a significant number of people.\nRealistically, standardization of procedure is essential for objective studies of hypnosis,  but  to  use  standardization  to  measure  hypnotizability  as  a  general  trait  is unnecessarily misleading. Experimental subjects who  can respond to impersonal procedures are demonstrating considerable flexibility. Subjects who don't respond well to such  standardized  procedures  may  well  be  hypnotizable,  but  may  require  greater individual consideration. In one-on-one psychotherapy with a competent clinician, such individuals would likely get that kind of individual consideration and thus be more likely to  respond  favorably.  Furthermore,  the  motivations  for  research  subjects  are  quite different from the motivations of therapy clients. Personal distress has a different effect on responsiveness than does intellectual curiosity.\n(2)  In  studies  of  hypnotizability,  the  person's  depth  of  hypnosis  is  measured  by  the demonstration of particular behaviors associated with presumed levels of hypnosis. For example,  in  order  for  a  subject  to  demonstrate  a  hypnotic  phenomenon  such  as  age regression,  the  subject  is  assumed  to  be  in  at  least  a  medium  level  of  hypnosis. Traditional concepts of hypnosis assume that if you can demonstrate phenomenon 'X,' then you must be at hypnosis level 'Y.'\nThis is an invalid assumption, for people demonstrate hypnotic phenomena continually in their everyday 'waking' state. For example, almost everyone has had the experience of being engrossed in a task, and only upon its completion noticing they have injured (e.g., cut, bruised) themselves slightly: 'I'm bleeding! Now how did that happen?' According to some, such a demonstration of hypnotic anesthesia is possible only in medium to deep levels  of  hypnosis!  In  the  skilled  use  of  indirect  techniques  of  hypnosis,  and  in spontaneous hypnotic experiences arising routinely in people, hypnosis has not even been formally induced with a procedure of any sort, yet subjects can still demonstrate various hypnotic phenomena.\n(3) Formal studies of hypnotizability also make the assumption that you must employ formal hypnotic inductions in order for hypnosis to occur, which is not necessarily the case.  People  often  enter  spontaneous,  informal  experiences  of  hypnosis,  and  these transient episodes of absorption can be every bit as useful to a clinician who knows how to recognize and utilize them as are the formally induced hypnotic experiences.\nThis  last  point,  especially,  is  a  source  of  contradiction  for  the  misconception  under consideration.  Since  people  enter  hypnotic  (focused,  absorbed,  responsive)  experiences spontaneously  on  a  regular  basis  (while  engaging  in  absorbing  conversations,  while watching  television,  while  reading,  while  making  love…),  it  is  not  unreasonable  to conclude  that  conscious,  information-processing  people  with  a  capacity  for  attentional absorption can be induced either formally or informally.\nWhat  factors  determine  hypnotizability?  The  theorizing  and  debating  in  the  field continues  even  now,  just  as  it has  for well  over  a century. The  vital issue of hypnotizability will be addressed in greater detail later.

        "text": "One of the most knowledgeable researchers and clinicians to ever study and practice  hypnosis  is  André  M.Weitzenhoffer,  Ph.D.  (1921-).  With  a  strong 'hard science'  background  in  physics,  engineering,  and  physiology,  and  an insatiable appetite for understanding the nature of hypnosis, Dr. Weitzenhoffer  gathered  and  integrated  a  broad  array  of  hypnosis  literature that  eventually  became  his  first  book,  a  1953  classic  called Hypnotism: An Objective Study in Suggestibility . After its completion, Dr. Weitzenhoffer was contacted by Dr. Ernest ('Jack') Hilgard, Ph.D., who initiated a collaborative attempt  to  establish  a  hypnosis  research  laboratory  at  Stanford  University, which the two successfully did. (Dr. Hilgard is the subject of another Frame of Reference in chapter 11.) Major effort was put forth by the two to develop a scale to measure hypnotic responsiveness, and the result was the Stanford Scales of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Forms A, B, and C . These scales are widely considered to provide the best 'objective' measure of the elusive trait called 'hypnotizability,' and so continue to be a backbone of the research wing of the  field  of  hypnosis.  Dr.  Weitzenhoffer  has  published  dozens  of  scientific articles and lectured internationally. He has been and continues to be a strong advocate  of  the  need  for  scientific  rigor  in  the  study  of  hypnosis,  and  is persuasive in his arguing for continuing the search for what many researchers consider the 'Holy Grail' of hypnosis, namely the definitive proof that a state of hypnosis even exists.\nThe Stanford lab closed over two decades ago, and Dr. Hilgard has since passed away. Dr. Weitzenhoffer enjoys his 'retirement' by working almost as hard as ever. He has recently published the second edition of his classic work, The Practice of Hypnotism (2000, Wiley), a critical and detailed consideration of  many  of  the  most  important  issues  in  the  field  as  seen  through  Dr. Weitzenhoffer's wise eyes.\nO n the Beginning of His Interest in Hypnosis: 'I think, initially, it was a demonstration  at  a  summer  camp,  done  by  a  camp  counselor,  that  kind  of intrigued  me.  He  did  postural  sway  tests.  He  was  a  mesmerist,  so  he  used passes. He would put people into a sort of hypnotic sleep, which was kind of weird. Later on, I went to a stage show and saw a magician that I don't think hypnotized anyone, but everyone was convinced he was hypnotizing people. So, I began to look it up in the encyclopedia to find out more about it. I had an inquisitive mind for most of my childhood, and it sometimes got me into trouble, too. But, that's how my interest arose.'**\nOn  the  Start  of  the  Stanford  Hypnosis  Research  Laboratory: 'Jack Hilgard came down just as I was doing the last six months of my dissertation. He  told  me  at  the  time  that  he  had  read  my  book  and  that  he  was  very impressed  by  the  fact  that  there  seemed  to  be  a  good  scientific  basis  for hypnotism. He asked me if I would like to join him at Stanford and jointly start  a  laboratory.  Before  doing  so,  we  both  spent  a  year  at  the  Center  for Advanced  Study  in  Behavioral  Sciences,  located  in  Palo  Alto.  Jack  and  I spent most of that time working on the details for the laboratory, what he and I had thought of doing, to see if we could work together.\n'I think, at that time, about 10 years of research was mapped out…. But the first thing we both agreed was necessary was some kind of good instrument to measure suggestibility, to measure depth.'**\nO n  Defining  Suggestibility  and  Suggestions: 'For  me,  suggestibility  is the capacity to produce responses to suggestion. Okay, that's very broad, so, I also  specify  that  the  response  must  at  least  be  non-voluntary…  If  the  nonvoluntary  aspect  is  not  there,  you  do  not  have  a  suggestion.  By  definition, suggestibility is the capacity to respond to a suggestion, that is, to produce a non-voluntary response… My definition of suggestion is that there must be something non-voluntary I can establish as taking place or be satisfied it is non-voluntary. The basic idea in the suggestion also must be fairly directly and clearly reflected by the behavior, either at the level of experience or at the level of actual behavior.'**\nO n  the  Idea  of  Everyday  Hypnotic  States: 'For  me,  it  is  important  to distinguish  what  is  hypnosis-to  define  what  it  is  and  to  define  what  it  is not… I don't like the idea of the everyday trance state because I don't think it has been clearly demonstrated that there are everyday trance states. If there are, I think the question obviously is: Are they a hypnotic state or not?… I'm willing  to  say  that  people  go  into  altered  states  of  awareness.  There  are  all kinds of altered states of awareness, and I think that of all the altered states of awareness that exist, there is a certain class of these states that probably we can call trance states. I don't think all altered states of consciousness should be called 'trance,' however. Certain trances are hypnosis. Others are probably not. Likewise, I believe that hypnosis can probably be identified with a class (really a subclass) of trance states and that while one can probably say that hypnosis is a trance, one cannot say that all trances are hypnosis.' **\nO n the Quality of Hypnosis in Laboratory versus Clinical Contexts: 'I reserve  the  word  'hypnosis'  for  the  state  or  condition  that  has  thus  been named. I have no reasons for believing that it is fundamentally different when produced in the laboratory and produced in a clinical\nsituation. However, it certainly can be experienced and outwardly manifests itself in different ways, and I cannot be certain at this stage in my knowledge that these differences might not be associated with some fundamental (but not just qualitative) differences in the state itself. I know that some have said that laboratory and clinical 'hypnosis' were different, but I have always understood this to be a reference to the production and use of the state rather than the state itself.'*\nO n  Lab  Findings  Directly  Relevant  to  Clinical  Practice:  'My main interest  has  been  in  checking  out  the  reality  and  properties  of  hypnosis,  of suggestions (and suggestibility), and of a few induced hypnotic effects. My work has provided a scientific foundation  to  the  subject  matter  of  hypnotic phenomena including the clinical uses of hypnosis. The three findings with the  most  relevance  are:  1)  the  fact  that,  all  other  things  being  equal,  all individuals do not respond equally well to direct suggestions; 2) the fact that under certain conditions, communications not intended to be suggestions will act  as  suggestions;  and,  3)  the  fact  that  direct  suggestions  give  rise  to automatisms (non-voluntary, and even non-conscious responses).'*\nO n Assessing Hypnotizability in Clinical Practice: 'Unless  a  patient  is taking part in a study that calls for such an assessment, doing one probably has  no  clinical  value.*  In  clinical  practice,  I  do  not  see  that  the  scales  are particularly useful unless you want to be rigorous. Because, for one thing, a good clinician, a good hypnotist, is going to very quickly get a good feeling for  what  the  patient  can  do  by  just  watching  how  the  patient  responds, whether he does  it  like  Milton  Erickson  or  he  does  it  in  a  more  traditional fashion. He gets some feedback which will tell him if the subject/patient is capable of developing specific responses under hypnosis… The other thing is that  they  are  an  intrusion  in  the  clinical  situation.  They  are  an  element  that seems to have nothing to do with therapy. Of course, you can tell the patient that,  'In  order  to  help  you,  I've  got  to  spend  an  hour  testing  you  with  this instrument.'… Anything else I'm going to find out would be in the course of working with the patient. If the patient can develop amnesia, I'll find that out presently. I start giving suggestions for it under the hypnotic state. Later, by asking questions I'll get some idea of how much amnesia is present. So that's why  I  say  I  don't  see  the  use  of  the  scales  in  the  clinical  setting  as desirable.'**\nO n  the  Skills  of  Good  Hypnotists: 'The  really  skilled  hypnotists  have skills  other  than  just  giving  a  suggestion.  They  have  skills  in  interpersonal relations,  including  the  ability  to  empathize,  establish  rapport,  and  observe what the client is doing, keeping that in mind, integrating\ntheir responses into what is going on.'**\nO n Pleasant  Findings  and  Disappointments: 'My  biggest  pleasant finding  (I  would  not  say  'surprise')  was  finding  evidence  that  suggested effects had a certain reality as elicited automatisms, that is, as non-voluntary responses to communications. My biggest disappointment has been not being able to date to show beyond doubt that the state of hypnosis exists or does not exist.'*\nSources: *Personal communication, August, 2002 **Personal Communication, December, 1988.",

        "text": "This particular misconception refers to the all-powerful Svengali image of the hypnotist, and is based on the belief that in order for a hypnotist to control someone, the individual must have little or no will of his or her own. Modern 'scare stories' about evil hypnotists who control people and force them into doing terrible things play on this misconception. As discussed earlier, the average person does not understand how the hypnotized person can be in control of him or herself while demonstrating unusual behaviors at the direction of the hypnotist.\nEach  person  has  a  capacity  for  will,  but  some  people  choose  not  to  exercise  their capacity to make choices, essentially giving the responsibility for themselves to others to manage. Such individuals assume a 'victim' role relative to others. The label of 'weakminded'  is  quite  inappropriate  for  such  persons  (Kirsch,  Lynn,  &  Rhue,  1993;  Lynn, Kirsch, & Rhue, 1996).\nTo counteract any negative effect this particular misconception may have had on the hypnosis-seeking public, many clinicians have made claims to the effect that people with higher intelligence and stronger personalities will be better hypnotic subjects. The ability to be hypnotized is not reliably correlated with specific personality traits, or other such factors as age or gender (Kirsch & Council, 1992). Despite it not being fully true, some clinicians  see  a  potential  value  in  making  the  claim  that  intelligent  people  do  better  as hypnotic subjects than their less intelligent counterparts. The potential value lies in the hope that the client will view him- or herself as intelligent, and so will be motivated to respond more readily. The other side of the coin, however, is that the person is seeking help  at  a  time  when  his  or  her  self-image  may  not  be  particularly  good  from  having attempted to cope with problems independently and been unsuccessful in resolving them. If a clinician sets a client up to respond positively on the basis of intelligence or any other seemingly desirable personal characteristic, and then the client has a less than satisfactory experience with hypnosis, the client may use the negative experience to validate his or her negative self-appraisal. This is only one example of how a well-meaning clinician can inadvertently do damage to a client. Rather than trying to get the person to identify with and become a model client, the clinician may better employ his or her skills in accepting what the client offers and using it as the basis for further hypnotic interaction.",

As  you  now  know,  nothing  is  farther  from  the  truth,  since  the  hypnotic process is an interaction based on mutual power, shared in order to attain some desirable therapeutic outcome. If a client chooses not to go into hypnosis for whatever reason, then he or she will not.\nThe nature of the hypnotic process is always context-determined, at least in part, since hypnosis  always  occurs  in  some  context  (T.Barber,  2000).  Even  the  most  responsive clients  can  refuse  to  follow  the  suggestions  of  a  clinician  if  they  so  choose.  Prior experience  with  hypnosis,  whether  good  or  bad,  is  not  the  sole  or  even  a  primary determining factor of whether hypnosis is accomplished or not. The personal characteristics  of  the  individual,  communication  and  relationship  factors  as  well  as situational  factors  are  all  key  variables  beyond  the  client's  history  that  will  help determine the outcome.\nOne  of  the  sources  for  this  misconception  is  the  stage  hypnotist's  use  of  'cues,' specific  words  or  gestures  that  have  become  associated  within  the  subject  to  the experience  of  entering  hypnosis,  allowing  him  to  re-enter  hypnosis  quickly.  From  the perspective of the audience, the hypnotist's use of a simple word or gesture to rapidly induce hypnosis is yet another dramatic demonstration of the hypnotist's power.\nIn clinical practice, it is often convenient to establish a cue in order to make subsequent inductions swifter and easier, but the power to induce hypnosis does not reside in the cue itself. Rather, it is the individual's willingness to respond to the cue that makes the cue a viable  trigger  for  hypnosis.  Should  the  client  be  given  the  cue  but  choose  not  to  enter hypnosis, he or she will not. The cue, also called a 'rapid induction signal,' is only effective  when  the  client  chooses  to  respond  to  it.  Beginning  or  ending  the  experience  of hypnosis is fully in the client's control.",

It  raises  many complex  issues  about  notions  of  free  will,  personal  responsibility  for  one's  actions, boundaries in the therapeutic relationship, the potential for abuse of one's position, and other such issues related to professional and personal conduct. In the clinical context, the relationship between clinician and client is necessarily one of mutual responsibility and accountability. In theory, the clinician offers entirely benevolent suggestions which the client  can  freely  choose  to  either  accept  or  reject.  In  practice,  however,  this  is  far  too simplistic to be entirely true given what we have come to know about the phenomenon of iatrogenesis  (i.e., client symptoms  either  caused  or  aggravated  by  treatment),  the exploitation of naïve or vulnerable clients, and the hazards of working with people who\nare  sometimes  psychologically  quite  disturbed.  But,  these  circumstances  represent  the exceptions and are atypical of therapeutic environments.\nThe capacity to influence people to do things against their will exists. There is little room  for  doubt  that  people  can  be  manipulated  negatively  to  do  things  seemingly inconsistent with their beliefs and attitudes (Bordens & Horowitz, 2002). To put it quite bluntly, brainwashing exists. However, the conditions necessary to effect such powerful influence  do  not  correspond  very  closely  to  the  typical  therapeutic  encounter.  In  other words, controlling a person is possible under certain conditions, but those conditions are not  in  and  of  themselves  hypnosis  (Laurence  &  Perry,  1988).  And,  they  are  quite  far removed from the respectful and empowering approaches to clinical hypnosis promoted in this book. Further discussion of these issues is contained in Chapters 6 and 7.",

In fact, there is some legitimate basis for concern about the use of hypnosis, but the concern should not be  about  the  experience  of  hypnosis  harming  anyone.  Instead,  the  concern  should  be about who practices hypnosis. Hypnosis itself is not harmful, but an incompetent clinician can  do  some  damage through  sheer  ignorance  about  the  complexity  of  each  person's mind, ignorance about the condition to be treated, or through a lack of respect for the integrity of each human being.\nThe process of formal (i.e., structured and overt) hypnotic induction is an absorbing process in which one's concentration is directed-perhaps to an idea, or to a voice, or to an internal experience, but always to something. There is a slowdown of physiological functions (e.g., breathing, heart rate) and typically the person's body is lethargic. Such physical responses are healthy, effectively reducing stress and discomfort. Many people do not recognize the amount of stress they carry within themselves until they experience the  comfort  of  hypnosis.  Then  they  are  able  to  distinguish  more  clearly  their  internal states and gradually develop greater control over their degree of tension. People suffering from hypertension, symptoms of stress, anxiety and pain can get substantial relief from hypnosis.  Hypnosis  is  physically  beneficial  to  any  client,  though.  Experience  with hypnosis  highlights  the  extraordinary  amount  of  self-control  one  can  attain,  even  of physical processes that are generally regarded as involuntary (Brown & Fromm, 1987; Rossi, 2000).",

        "text": "In  terms  of  potential  emotional  harm,  it  is  not  hypnosis  itself  that  may  cause  someone problems, but difficulties may arise due to misdiagnosis, the inappropriate content of a session,  or  the  inability  of  a  clinician  to  effectively  guide  the  client  (J.Barber,  1995; Kleinhaus & Eli, 1987). The same conditions exist in any helping relationship where one person  is  in  distress,  vulnerable,  and  seeking  relief.  An  inexperienced  or  uneducated\nhelper may inadvertently (rarely is it intentional) misdiagnose a problem or its dynamics, offer poor advice, make grandiose promises, impose an antitherapeutic point of view, or simply waste the person's time and money.\nHypnosis  often  gives  the  client  access  to  memories  and  feelings  long  outside  of conscious awareness (McConkey, 1992; Sheehan, 1995). The content of such memories may be distressing, as they often are in therapy, and an inexperienced clinician may feel unable  or  unqualified  to  handle  the  client's  issues  effectively.  In  such  instances,  the clinician may have gotten more than he or she bargained for, although someone else may have  been  able  to  use  the  exact  same  information  or  responses  to  great  therapeutic advantage.\nThe  less  skilled  clinician  may  have  helped  to  'open  up'  another  person,  but  it's  a wasted and even potentially damaging opportunity if the person has no capacity to do any real therapy. An unfortunate example is one self-proclaimed 'hypnotist, healer, psychic counselor'  I  once  encountered  who  attempted  to  impress  me  by  describing  his  use  of hypnosis with a woman who presented to him the problem of intense guilt feelings over an abortion she'd had. He used hypnosis to have her vividly imagine the fetus was still alive within her. He then directed her to have a dialogue with it, even giving it a name, in order  to  explain  to  it  why  she  needed  to  abort  it.  He  thought  this  would  be  a  good technique for settling the matter, and wondered why such a 'reasonable' approach didn't fare too well. She left him  feeling much  worse  than  when  she  came  in. His thoughtlessness confirmed her worst fears-that she had killed a person with a name and personality.  Regardless  of  your  views  on  abortion,  you  can  probably  recognize  the inappropriateness of the intervention when the goal was to reduce the client's distress.\nThis  type  of  encounter  is  a  basis  for  the  misconception  that  hypnosis  does  harm. Clearly, hypnosis does not cause harm, but ineffective or inappropriate use of hypnosis can. Ineffective use of any skill,  whether it be surgery, psychological testing, or giving haircuts  can  hurt  someone.  Just  as  dentistry  is  not  dangerous,  but  a  poor  dentist  is, hypnosis is not dangerous, but a poor hypnotist is. Theoretically, we have governmental agencies for regulating clinical licensure and practice, but, unfortunately, at the practical level, it is literally impossible to separate those who are competent from those who are not.  To  compound  this  problem,  in  most  places  people  can  and  do  practice  hypnosis without  any  academic  requirement  or  clinical  training,  much  less  licensure.  (A  smart consumer will have to do some 'shopping' for a competent, well-trained clinician.)\nThe flip side of this delicate issue, and the best of all reasons for developing skills in hypnotic approaches, is the emotional good that hypnosis can help generate. In its ability to give  people  greater  feelings  of  self-control  and  a  subsequent  increase  of  selfconfidence,  hypnosis  is  a powerful  means  for  resolving  emotional  problems  and enhancing emotional well-being. It is essential that the clinician have enough knowledge and skill to use it toward that end.",

Dependency is a need, a reliance, that everyone has to some degree. To a greater or lesser extent, we all depend on others for things we feel are important to our well-being. In the helping professions especially, people are seeking help at a time they are hurting and vulnerable. They depend on the clinician to help, to comfort, and to care.\nClinicians know that the ultimate goal of responsible treatment must be to help each client  establish  self-reliance  and  independence  whenever  possible.  Rather  than  foster dependence  by  indirectly  encouraging  the  client  to  view  the  clinician  as  the  source  of answers  to  all  of  life's  woes,  hypnosis  used  properly  helps  the  person  in  distress  turn inwards  in  order  to  make  use  of  the  many  experiences  and  resources  the  person  has acquired over his or her lifetime that can be used therapeutically. Consistent with the goal of self-reliance and the use of personal power to help one's self is the teaching of selfhypnosis to those you work with (Alman, 2001).\nThere is an old saying: 'If you give a man a fish, you have given him a meal. If you teach him how to fish, you have given him a livelihood.' Teaching self-hypnosis to those you work with is a means for helping to ensure that your clients can continue to work independently  and  grow  in  your  absence.  Furthermore,  teaching  them  strategies  for problem-solving  along  with  self-hypnosis  can  allow  for  the  emergence  of  a  selfcorrecting mechanism that can assure those you work with that they do have control over their lives. It gives you an assurance that you have done your work well.",

The inexperienced clinician may get anxious or even panic when the client does not respond to  direct  suggestions to open his or her eyes and return to the usual 'waking' state. In such situations, the client is not 'stuck,' but instead simply chooses not to terminate the hypnosis  session  for  at  least  one  of  a  couple  of  reasons:  Either  the  client  is  quite comfortable  where  he  or  she  is,  or  the  client  is  still  working  on  completing  the experience, that is, getting closure. The best thing to do in such a circumstance is offer an open-ended suggestion that the client can bring him- or herself out of hypnosis when he or she wants to-and then leave him or her alone to do so!

Observed from outside the experience, someone in hypnosis may physically resemble  someone  who  is  asleep,  showing  minimal  activity,  muscular relaxation, slowed breathing, and so on. However, from a mental standpoint, objectively measurable in a variety of ways, the client is relaxed, conscious, and alert. Ever-present is some level of awareness of current goings-on, even when in deep hypnosis. In the case of spontaneous hypnosis, as well as in the condition of so-called 'alert hypnosis' where the person  has  his  or  her  eyes  open  and  is  engaged  in  some  focused  task,  conscious awareness  is  even  more  marked.  Physical  relaxation  need  not  be  present  in  order  for hypnosis to occur (Cardeña, Alarcón, Capafons, & Bayot, 1998).\nMisinformation circulated for years about hypnosis being comparable to learning while asleep. 'Sleep learning' was soundly disproven years ago, however. Although you may not learn while you're asleep, you can learn while in the transition phases, that is, while falling  asleep  and  awakening  at  those  midpoints  between  being  asleep  and  awake commonly called 'twilight states.'\nA source of this misconception is the word 'hypnosis' itself, a word derived from the Greek  word  'Hypnos,'  the  word  for  sleep  and  the  name  of  the  Greek  God  of  Sleep (Gravitz, 1991). The word 'hypnosis' was coined early in the nineteenth century and has been used to describe hypnosis ever since. Many early theorists, most notably Hippolyte Bernheim in France in the late 19th century, thought of  hypnosis  as a  special  form  of sleep, and this viewpoint was widely taught to students of hypnosis (Hull, 1933/2002). Thus, early practitioners reinforced this erroneous viewpoint each time they offered the ritualistic suggestions to 'sleep deeply' and 'wake up' to their clients. Hypnosis is not sleep, and even the client in deep hypnosis is oriented to external reality to some degree. Therefore,  the  use  of  obsolete  phrases  like  'sleep  deeply'  are  neither  relevant  to  or indicative of the client's experience, and so should not be used in doing hypnosis.",

Likewise,  the  various  hypnotic  phenomena  can  and  do  arise spontaneously  even  when  no  induction  has  taken  place.  You  may  recall  my  earlier description  of  times  when  you  were  deeply  absorbed  in  doing  something,  and  only afterward  did  you  notice  you  were  injured  or  bleeding.  That  is  an  example  of  a spontaneous anesthesia, one of the classic hypnotic phenomena to be discussed at length later.

No  one  would  simply  do  a  relaxation  process  and  then  expect  the  client  to undergo a painless surgery. Hypnosis involves the deliberate structuring of experiences like anesthesia that go well beyond simple relaxation.\nHypnosis has been described as an experience of focused attention and absorption in experience that can be quite removed from immediate goings-on. The involvement in the experience of hypnosis can vary in intensity according to a number of factors, such as the client's level of motivation to participate in the process, the person's ability to focus, the relevance of the clinician's suggestions, and so forth. Must someone be relaxed, sitting with eyes closed in order for hypnosis to occur? No. Briefly mentioned earlier was the phenomenon  called  'alert  hypnosis,'  or  what  some  call  'waking  hypnosis'  (Bányai, Zseni,  &  Tury,  1993).  In  these  conditions,  clients  or  research  subjects  are  given suggestions to focus intensely on some activity (e.g., riding a stationery bike or running on a treadmill), and with their eyes open while physically active, they are exposed to a hypnotic induction and then given suggestions to generate various hypnotic phenomena, which they may readily do (Bányai & Hilgard, 1978).\nAs you're learning, hypnosis can occur spontaneously while convers-ing, reading, and in countless other instances where one's attention is fixed. You can be anxious, even in suspense,  and  still  be  wonderfully  focused,  as  in  'glued  to  a  mystery.'  Thus, physical relaxation is not a necessary prerequisite for hypnosis to occur .\nIn clinical practice, however, relaxation is usually a part of the intervention, since it is comforting  and  soothing,  and  reduces  the  stress  and  anxiety  often  associated  with people's problems. Relaxation generally makes it easier to enlist cooperation on the part\nof  the  client,  as  most  clients  want  or  expect  it  as  part  of  the  process.  Relaxation  also makes  access  to  the  client's  unconscious  (i.e.,  hidden)  resources  easier.  Furthermore, relaxation  can  highlight  the  subjective  differences  between  the  experience  of  hypnosis and the usual 'waking' state, convincing the client that he or she has, in fact, experienced an altered state of consciousness that fits with expectations of what hypnosis 'should' be like (Sarbin, 1997).",

After all, how  many  other  therapy  approaches  emphasize  generating  and  utilizing  a  client's dissociated and suggestible state for increasing therapeutic responses the way practitioners of hypnosis do? On the other hand, whatever resources you try to mobilize and whatever skills you try to teach the client may be better described in other specific models of psychotherapy. Thus, there is a legitimate basis for saying clinical hypnosis is not a specific school of therapy in its own right, like behavior therapy or analytic therapy, despite  the  popular  use  of  the  term  'hypnotherapy.'  Clinical  hypnosis  is  a  therapeutic tool  that  is  not  aligned  with  any  one  theoretical  or  practical  orientation  (Kirsch  et  al., 1993).\nSo,  what  of  the  term  'hypnotherapy?'  Does  it  mean  anything?  It  implies  therapy delivered hypnotically, that is, the creation and utilization of the subjective experience of hypnosis  in  order  to  enhance  treatment  effects.  And,  as  you  have  already  learned, hypnosis can enhance treatment effects. There is something special about hypnosis that warrants giving it a unique position in the realm of treatment. But should it be considered a distinct form of therapy?\nThere are nearly as many approaches to the use of hypnosis as there are clinicians who use hypnosis, and inevitably they use it in a way that is consistent with their beliefs about therapy  and  the  way  they  believe  therapy  should  be  done.  So,  for  some  clinicians, hypnosis is integrated with cognitive-behavioral approaches, and for others it is integrated with psycho-dynamic approaches. For some, it is integrated with mind-body healing approaches, and for others it is integrated with preventive approaches. Whatever belief  system  and  style  of  therapy  you  currently  practice  will  likely  continue  to  be meaningful to  you  as  you  discover  ways  to  enhance  what  you  already  do  by  applying hypnotic approaches.\nI have always been amused that whenever I state that I use patterns of hypnosis in my work, my professional peers smile and think they know what I do. Few of them actually do. What one clinician who uses hypnosis does with it and what another does with it may be  as  different  as  night  and  day.  Almost  any  procedure  that  involves  the  induction  of hypnosis and the use of suggestions has been called 'hypnosis,' unfortunately, and the countless variations of such general methods that are possible get lost under the generic label. Learning methods and principles of hypnosis is much like learning a language. You learn a common set of rules, words, and structures, yet you will still inevitably express yourself in your own unique way.",

Many  books  and  clinical  trainings  on hypnosis  advocate  the  verbatim  use  of  prepared  scripts  that  have  been  written  for  all types  of  general  problems,  such  as  overweight,  smoking,  phobias,  and  so  on.  In  such approaches, if you encounter a smoker wanting to stop smoking, for example, you are encouraged to turn to a particular section of the hypnosis book and then read the antismoking set of suggestions to the client (after you have read the hypnosis induction script on a previous page!).\nThe  use  of  scripts  robs  hypnosis  of  its  real  potency,  the  strength  derived  from  the recognition and use of each individual's unique experiences and needs. Spontaneity and flexibility  are  essential  for  best  results  in  doing  hypnosis.  Even  when  a  therapeutic strategy  is  worked  out  beforehand,  as  good  treatment  planning  may  require,  a  skilled clinician will still incorporate the spontaneous responses of the client into the procedure.\nThe use of scripts promotes the misconception that hypnosis in clinical practice can be standardized and that each client  is  identical  as  long  as  they  have  the  same  presenting complaint. Reading the same script to all smokers as if they are the same simply because they  all  share  a  bad  habit  is  an  obvious  gross  oversimplification,  and  when  such  an approach fails, typically the client gets blamed, rather than the approach.\nThe  dynamic  and  spontaneous  nature  of  skilled  applications  of  clinical  hypnosis  is what makes it so complex and demanding an ability to acquire. Hypnosis as a therapeutic tool is ever-changing with the context in which it arises, and must therefore be adapted to the individual needs of the client and situation. People will likely continue to use the term 'hypnotherapy' to offer a label for what they do, but it only implies the use of hypnosis and  suggestion  in  the  most  general  sense,  and  reveals  very  little  else  about  what  they actually say and do with their clients.",

The computer metaphor is highly inaccurate, however, and has the potential to be hazardous if an unwary clinician operates on that premise (Loftus & Yapko, 1995; Yapko, 1994a, 1994b). The research on memory makes it abundantly clear that  the  mind does not take in experience and store it in exact form for accurate recall later. In fact, memories are stored on the basis of perceptions, and so are subject to the same  potential  distortions.  People  can  'remember'  things  in  vivid  detail  that  did  not actually happen. Likewise, people can remember  only  selected fragments of an experience, or they can take bits and pieces of multiple memories and combine them into one false memory. Memory, simply put, is not reliable; if you are looking for 'truth,' you are unlikely to find it in memory (Sheehan, 1995).\nThe myths about hypnosis and a dose of reality    47GLYPH<9>\nCan a memory be considered more reliable because it was obtained through hypnosis? Can hypnosis be used to uncover the truth of what actually happened in someone's past? The answer to these two critically important questions is no.

        "text": "How you think about clinical hypnosis has profound implications for what you perceive to be its potential applications. Over  the years there have  been  many  different perspectives  offered  by  clinicians  and  researchers  to  characterize  the  phenomenon  of hypnosis  (see  Lynn  &  Rhue's  1991  volume, Theories  of  Hypnosis, for  an  excellent elaboration  of  many  of  these  models).  As  you  would  predict,  these  viewpoints  often differ  sharply.  Each  of  these  perspectives  considered  individually  has  played  a  role  in both illuminating and confounding our understandings of hypnosis. In general, theories have a paradoxical effect: They catalyze understanding by helping one discover meanings and relationships in an otherwise apparently random universe, and yet theories can often confound matters by limiting one's observations to only what the theory allows for.\nWith a subject as complex as hypnosis, the inadequacy of a single theory to explain the broad  range  of  responses  on  so  many  different  dimensions  of  experience  becomes glaringly  apparent.  The  complexities  of  the  subject  of  hypnosis,  and  the  even  greater complexities of the human being capable of hypnosis, are so great that it seems highly improbable that a single theory can evolve to explain its origin and character.\nMy direct comment about the inadequacy of a single theory's ability to account for all hypnotic  phenomena  is  actually  an  indirect  comment  in  favor  of  believing  a  little  of everything, and all of nothing. The theories of hypnosis that have been developed over the  years  are  each  useful  in  their  own  way  for  describing  one  or  more  aspects  of hypnosis,  but  none  can  be  considered  the  final  word  in  describing  the  process  or experience of hypnosis.\nThis  chapter  provides  an  overview  and  discussion  of  some  of  the  more  influential theoretical perspectives of hypnosis informing today's clinicians and researchers. I'd like to  encourage you to think critically about each viewpoint, perhaps by first considering what it assumes and evaluating for yourself whether its assumptions seem reasonable and helpful to you. It would be especially helpful for you to consider each model of hypnosis from the perspective of the clinician operating within it, then the individual perspective of the client experiencing it, and finally as a result of the interaction of the two. This may help  you  distinguish  between  what  may  be  intellectually  interesting  versus  what  is clinically meaningful and effective.\nThe various models of hypnosis can be differentiated from one another in a variety of ways.  I  have  found  it  helpful  to  think  in  terms  of  two  general  categories  of  hypnosis which may exist singly or in combination that encompass the diverse models:\n1. Intrapersonal models which emphasize the subjective traits and states of the hypnotized person as the basis for hypnosis;\n2. Interpersonal models which emphasize the social or relational aspects of the hypnotic interaction.\nModels  of  hypnosis  can  also  be  differentiated,  as  Lynn  &  Rhue  (1991)  suggested, according  to  single  or  multifactor  conceptualizations.  Single  factor  models  suggest  a single variable influencing hypnotic experience, such as relaxation as described in the last chapter  (Edmonston,  1977,  1981,  1991).  Multifactor  conceptualizations  consider  a variety of interactional forces combining to produce hypnotic phenomena, such as client expectations and clinician demands (Kirsch, 2000).\nLet's briefly consider some of these models.",

        "text": "The  neodissociation  model  of  Ernest  Hilgard  (1974,  1986,  1991,  1992)  has  exerted profound  influence  on  the  field.  Most  clinicians  learn  about  dissociation  in  terms  of pathological  conditions,  such  as  Dissociative  Identity  Disorder.  However,  dissociation represents  a  human  capacity  for  compartmentalizing  different  elements  of  subjective experience. This capacity can be helpful in a variety of ways if utilized skillfully.\nHilgard's  neodissociation  model  is  based  on  the  view  that  humans  have  multiple cognitive  systems  capable  of  functioning  simultaneously.  These  are  arranged  in  a hierarchy  under  the  control  of  an  executive  system,  called  an  'executive  ego'  or  a 'central control structure.' Cognitive subsystems may include habits, attitudes, prejudices,  interests,  and  other  latent  abilities.  The  executive  system  is  tasked  with monitoring and formulating responses to ongoing subjective experience. In the condition of  hypnosis,  the  various  cognitive  systems  can  function  autonomously,  effectively dissociated from one another to a significant degree. Hilgard described it this way:\nThe central executive functions in hypnosis are typically thought to be divided between the hypnotist and the hypnotized person. The latter retains a considerable portion of the executive functions from his or her normal statethe  ability  to  answer  questions  about  his  or  her  past  and  plans,  as  well  as  to accept or refuse invitations to move about or to participate in specific kinds of activities. At the same time the subject turns over some of his or her executive functions to the hypnotist, so that within the hypnotic contract, the subject will do what the hypnotist suggests, experience what the hypnotist suggests, and lose control of his or her movements if this is indicated. (Hilgard, 1992, p. 94)\nThe  research  sparked  by  the  neodissociation  model  has  been  extraordinary  in  both volume and quality of findings and has led to some of the most important understandings within the field of hypnosis (Kihlstrom, 1985, 1997). Primarily an intrapersonal model, Hilgard's research, and that of other neodissociationists, has focused on the dissociative and other hypnotic capacities of individuals  as  the  eventual  determinants  of  successful hypnosis.  Hilgard  has  made  a  strong  case  for  viewing  hypnotizability  as  a  measurable difference between and a stable trait across individuals (Hilgard, 1965, 1967).",

        "text": "In this theoretical perspective rooted in the origins of modern hypnosis in the mid-19th century (Bernheim, 1886/1957) and still being researched today with a greater emphasis on the changes in physiology associated with hypnosis (Rossi, 2000), special emphasis is given to what is presumed to be the passive role of the client, whose position is defined as one  of  responding  to  the  directives  of  the  clinician.  Is  hypnosis  a  state  of  passivity  or arousal? It's both. This primarily intrapersonal model explores the active-passive paradox of  hypnosis  that  has  confused  and  divided  clinicians  about  what  is  happening  in  the subjective experience of the client. It has led to an emphasis on striving to understand the phenomenological experience of the client, and good research has been done to make it easier  to  define  and  to  measure  such  experience  (McConkey,  1986;  Pekala  &  Kumar, 2000; Pekala, 2002).\nOne of the ways to describe a clinician's style of hypnotic intervention is in terms of the degree of authoritarian or permissive suggestions employed (discussed in chapter 12). An authoritarian practitioner is characterized as one who is direct and commanding. The stage  hypnotist  is  a  classic  example  of  the  authoritarian  approach,  evidenced  by  such common  direct  suggestions  as,  'You  are  going  to  go  deeper  asleep  when  I  snap  my fingers…. When you open your eyes you will laugh uncontrollably as if you're viewing the funniest movie you've ever seen…. When I clap my hands, you will stutter and be unable  to  say  your  name…'  (clever  stuff,  isn't  it?).  A  permissive  style  is  one  that emphasizes  possibilities without  making  specific  demands  on  the  client,  as  in a suggestion such as, ' Perhaps you'll be more comfortable if you let your eyes close.'\nThe authoritarian approach of some clinicians is the basis for this theory's description of  the  demeanor  of  the  client  in  hypnosis  as  a  passive,  permissive  one.  Specifically,  a permissive  client  is  characterized  as  one  who  permits  the  clinician  to  direct  his  or  her experience,  seemingly  expressing  no  will  of  his  or  her  own.  The  client  is  expected  to fully respond to the suggestions of the clinician, and no initiative on the part of the client is either expected or deemed necessary. Due to the secondary, reactive role taken in the therapeutic  relationship,  the  client  is  essentially  viewed  as  a  passive  receptacle  for  the authoritarian  clinician's  suggestions.  The  client's  only  task  is  to  simply  comply.  If  the client fails to respond to the clinician's direct suggestions to the clinician's satisfaction for  some  reason,  the  client  is  deemed  'resistant.'  The  resistance  is  presumed  to  be evidence  of  some  defense  mechanism  or  pathology  of  some  sort  that  needs  to  be identified and  'worked  through.'  The  possibility  that  the  client  simply  finds  the suggestions unsuitable is not well considered in this model.\nIf  a  clinician adopts a permissive style in guiding the client, a style that may be less direct and is certainly less demanding, the client is defined as an active participant in the process  of  making  suggested  possibilities  come  to  life.  In  such  a  client-activated approach, the 'permissive state' theory of hypnosis is no longer as plausible.\nThe 'permissive state' theory contains some truth that is even verifiable physiologically  (Sturgis  &  Coe,  1990)  but  is  most  relevant  only  to  a  style  of  practice rather  than  representative  of  the  phenomenon  of  hypnosis.  One  can  view  the  quiet, cataleptic (fixed, unmoving) client as a passive receptacle for suggestions. One can view\nthe  formation and verbalization of suggestions on the part of the clinician as an active process. Superficially, the hypnotic interaction may thus seem to be one of the clinician being the active one and the client the passive one. Discussed earlier, however, was the notion that if you allow another person to guide your experience, the person in control is the  one  who  has  the  power  to  'allow'  the  actions  of  another.  The  role  of  the  client, therefore, is not a passive one. Rather, it is an active one in the sense that it is the client's ability  and  responsibility  to  respond,  in  whole  or  in  part,  to  the  suggestions  of  the clinician  that  makes  hypnosis  happen.  And,  a  response  is  inevitable,  since  even  no response is a response!\nFurthermore, more recent concepts of hypnosis emphasize the need for the clinician to flexibly  follow  the  leads  of  the  client,  rather  than  expecting  the  client  to  obediently follow the arbitrary leads of the clinician. This is quite different in concept and practice from the client, facing an authoritarian hypnotist who requires compliance, and who has the responsibility of adapting him- or herself to the suggestions of the clinician. Adapting yourself to authoritarian suggestions that may not even be particularly well suited and yet finding a way to make them meaningful is not a passive state at all. In reality, may of the clinicians who practice in such an authoritarian style succeed in spite of themselves, with the client's help, rather than because of themselves. How does a clinician employing an induction method such as counting down from 10 to 1, for example, cause someone to enter  hypnosis,  unless  the  client  is  working  hard  at  making  such  arbitrary  suggestions meaningful?\nThe metaphor some people use of 'programming' the client is based on this model. However, as you will discover as soon as you start doing hypnosis with people, people aren't easily 'programmed.' Therapy, especially therapy with hypnosis, would be a much more successful endeavor if doing inductions and telling people what to do was all that was required. But, if the clinician offers suggestions that are unacceptable to the client for some  reason,  the  'permissive  client'  can  passively  reject  them,  in  essence  'doing nothing,' a condition the authoritarian clinician is likely to call 'resistance.' The client's role in many ways is an active one of making use of the clinician's suggestions if and when those suggestions are appropriate and can be meaningfully utilized. The paradox inherent in this theory is the active role of passivity.",

        "text": "There is a considerable amount of confusion and speculation over whether there really is a  condition  of  human  experience  that  can  be  called  'hypnosis.'  A  large  and  growing body of evidence indicates that the phenomena of hypnosis are not best explained by the notion  of  a  specific  state  of  experience  called  'hypnosis'  (T.Barber,  2000;  Wagstaff, 1986). In light of advanced neuro-imaging technology, discussed in the next chapter, is there a discrete and consistently measurable change that takes place we can point to and say, 'There! That's hypnosis!'? Unfortunately, as André Weitzenhoffer lamented in last chapter's  Frame  of  Reference,  no  evidence  for  a  specific  state  called  hypnosis  has  yet been found. Graphs of brain waves, measurements of biochemical changes in the body, and  objective  readings  on  the  activity  of  the  nervous  system  are  revealing  ever  more\nabout the internal workings of hypnotic experience, yet they are still ambiguous enough to prevent us from defining hypnosis in purely, or even primarily, in physiological terms.\nConsequently, there are some theorists (T.Barber, 1969; Sarbin, 1950; Sarbin & Coe, 1972)  who  long  ago  adopted  the  perspective  that  hypnosis  is  nothing  separate  from normal  experience  and  that  the  unusual  behaviors  associated  with  hypnosis  can  be accomplished  by  anyone  sufficiently  motivated  to  so  behave  in  the  absence  of  any mention of hypnosis (Kihlstrom, 1991). Hypnotic phenomena thus occur as a consequence  of  an  interpersonal  context  labeled  by  the  participants  as  'hypnosis.'  In their view, hypnosis exists only when someone is willing to play the socially prescribed role of a hypnotized individual. Theodore Sarbin, Ph.D., at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is a principal architect of the model characterizing hypnosis as a social role. Sarbin's  concept  of  role  enactment  as  central  to  hypnosis  led  him  to  coin  the  phrase describing hypnosis as 'believed-in imaginings' (1997). He described his view this way:\nRole conceptions have been fruitfully employed to describe social behavior of all  kinds,  not  only  hypnosis.  Of  central  importance,  both  for  social  actions generally and for hypnosis particularly, is that the person is regarded as a doer, a performer,  an  agent,  not  an  inert  object  that  passively  processes  information. Instead of happenings in the mind, the focus of role theory is on what the person does  and  how  he  or  she  does  it,  taking  into  account  immediate  and  remote contexts in which the performance occurs. (Sarbin, 1997; p. 204)\nThinking of  hypnotic  behavior  as  role-governed  social  behavior  obviously  defines  this hypnosis  model  as  an  interpersonal  one,  taking  into  account  socially  prescribed  roles, expectations, power, and influence. Support for this perspective comes from a variety of research,  addressing  issues  of  whether  hypnosis  is  mere  compliance  (Spanos  &  Coe, 1992; Wagstaff, 1991) or whether responses are, in fact, nonvolitional (Lynn, Rhue, & Weekes,  1990).  Classic  studies  conducted  by  Martin  Orne,  M.D.,  Ph.D.,  who  was Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania (see his Frame of Reference in chapter 9), were among the very first to address the issues of the  confounds of distinguishing simulating versus 'genuinely' hypnotized subjects and the  demand characteristics of hypnosis encounters that could yield responses that were merely  compliant  rather  than  hypnotic  (Orne,  1959,  1962a,  1962b,  1966,  1971).  An experimental scenario might involve a group of subjects who are instructed to behave 'as if'  they  were  hypnotized  and  mixed  with  a  group  of  subjects  who  were  overtly  and willingly formally hypnotized. A number of 'experts' in hypnosis are then challenged to discover  which  individuals  were  and  were  not  'truly'  hypnotized.  Subjects  who  roleplayed hypnotic behavior were extremely convincing in their manifestations of hypnotic phenomena and were able to successfully confound the experts.\nIt is not particularly difficult to appreciate the elements of truth in this perspective for its emphasis on the motivation to adhere to a social role. Consider an extreme example to make the point: Imagine someone holding a gun to your head who says, 'I am going to poke  you  in  the  stomach  with  a  safety  pin,  and  if  you  so  much  as  flinch  I'll  pull  the trigger.' Most probably, you would be highly motivated to immediately develop a means for with-standing pain that defies objective measurement,  but is clearly present",

        "text": "nonetheless. Likewise, if someone offered you a huge sum of money, or something else that you find rewarding, to motivate you to demonstrate some feat normally considered beyond your means, it probably wouldn't surprise you much to discover capabilities you did  not  know  you  had.  Creating  unusual  circumstances  to  yield  unique  and  beneficial responses in people that involve hidden resources is at the heart of strategic psychotherapies, as well as many hypnotic interventions.\nRole-playing hypnotic behavior is a significant component of the stage show process. Subjects  may  not  'feel  hypnotized'  in  the  way  they  may  have  expected  to  experience some altered state, but because of the flow of the stage process they are likely to go along and conform to the demands of the role. One of the classic techniques of hypnosis plays on this, called the 'As if'technique in which a person is asked to act 'as if' he or she can do the thing he or she feels unable to do (e.g., relax, go into hypnosis) long enough to actually  do  it  and  experience  what  it's  like  to  do  it.  The  issue  then  becomes  one  of whether  it  really  matters  if  the  action  is  real  or  a  pretense  if  the  outcome  is  the  same regardless of the intention. In other words, if a client is not really hypnotized, but acts as if he  or  she  is  hypnotized  well  enough  for  the  clinician  to  get  whatever  hypnotic responses are desired,  then  does  it  really  matter  that  the  person  doesn't  feel  genuinely hypnotized? (As a clinical example, if a phobic person acts as if he or she isn't phobic in some context that normally generates anxiety, and he or she doesn't become anxious, is it a  pretense-or a cure?) Frequently, stage show hypnotists will ask their subjects at the end of the show whether they were hypnotized, and a common response is a hesitant, 'I don't think so.' Yet  just a few  minutes  ago  that same  person  was  responding enthusiastically  to  the  suggestion  to  hallucinate  the  nudity  of  the  entire  audience,  the suggestion to be unable to remember his or her own name, and other such 'entertaining' suggestions.\nRole-playing  has  long  been  recognized  by  social  scientists  as  a  way  of  absorbing  a person's attention by encouraging him or her to 'get lost in the role.' Many therapeutic strategies (e.g., psychodrama,  behavioral rehearsals, family therapy role-reversals) regularly involve role-playing as a way of rehearsing positive responses in troublesome situations  or  developing empathy for another person. Initially, the client typically  feels self-conscious and uncomfortable in the role, but gradually adapts to the role demands and is soon immersed in it. If you have never seen this kind of phenomenon, perhaps you can use your own experience as an illustration. Can you recall a time when you were in a bad  mood,  perhaps  even  depressed,  sitting  around  your  house  when  the  doorbell  rang unexpectedly? After you won-dered to yourself, 'Who could that be?' you answered the door and there was a friend of yours just coming by for a casual visit. Charitably, you decided you didn't want to depress this person by being in a bad mood, so you began to act 'as if' you were in a semi-decent, or perhaps even good, mood. Did you notice that after a brief while you genuinely were in a good mood? Almost everyone has had this kind  of  experience,  and  it  is  a  useful  example  to  illustrate  the  power  associated  with playing a role.\nPlaying a role can even change someone's behavior quite dramatically beyond the time he or she stops playing the role. This is a point long recognized, for even at the turn of the last century, the philosopher and psycholo-gist William James asked the question, 'Does a person smile because he is happy, or is he happy because he smiles?' In some powerful\nresearch  done  by  psychologist  Philip  Zimbardo  at  Stanford  University,  a  mock  prison was set up in the psychology building, and a group of student experimental subjects were divided  into  'guard'  and  'prisoner'  roles.  The  results  of  the  experiment  were  both startling  and  dramatic.  A  mentality  associated  with  the  role  evolved,  with  guards becoming  abusive  and  even  brutal,  and  prisoners  becoming  passive,  obsessed  with escape, and ultimately depressed and agitated. Role playing behavior became so intense, the experiment had to be called off for everyone's well-being.\nRole-playing as a theoretical perspective on the phenomenon of hypnosis is useful up to  the  point,  wherever that  may  be,  where  the  artificial  experience  becomes genuine, a 'believed-in imagining' as Sarbin termed it. A client or research subject may begin by playing at hypnotic behavior, but at a certain, idiosyncratic point along the way, a true hypnotic  experience  begins.  Role-playing  involves  a  conscious  effort  to  adhere  to  the behaviors scripted by a role. Until one's involvement in the role is deep enough to allow unconscious identification with that role, role-playing hypnosis is an experience occurring largely on the conscious level. Consciousness is limited (how many things can you  pay  attention  to  at  one  time?);  the  unconscious  mind  is  less  so.  When  responses become  unconscious  (i.e.,  nonvolitional),  the  role-play  is  over  and  a  true  hypnotic absorption begins.",

        "text": "A dominant model in the field of hypnosis today, and growing ever more influential over time, the sociocognitive model emphasizes social roles but also focuses intently on the cognitive makeup of the individual, including his or her expectations, beliefs, attitudes, attributional  style,  and  other  such  factors  influencing  social  responsiveness  (Lynn  & Sherman, 2000). Psychologist Theodore X.Barber, Ph.D., has been especially prolific in his  writings  and  research  into  the  multiple factors comprising hypnotic responsiveness. (He is featured in a Frame of Reference section in chapter 6.) Barber has considered both intrapersonal  characteristics  of  the  client,  such  as  fantasy  proneness  and  imaginative ability, and interpersonal characteristics of the social context of hypnosis. His view is that there are four especially important behavior-determining factors regulating the hypnotic experience:\n(a)  social  factors that  obligate  the  socialized  subject  to  cooperate  and  try  to actualize  or  realize  the  hypnotists's  expectations  and  explicit  suggestions;  (b) the  hypnotists's unique  skills  and  personal  characteristics  (including  creative ideas, communicative ability, and interpersonal efficacy) and the nature of the hypnotist-subject interpersonal relationship; (c) the effectiveness of the induction procedure in guiding the subject to think-with the suggestions; and (d) the depth of meaning, creativity, and 'force' or 'power' of the suggested ideas . (T.Barber, 2000)\nOther  prominent  sociocognitive  theorists,  including  Nicholas  Spanos,  Ph.D.  (1991; Spanos & Chaves, 1989), Irving Kirsch, Ph.D. (1991; Kirsch & Lynn, 1995), Graham Wagstaff, Ph.D. (1991), and Steven Lynn, Ph.D. (Lynn & Rhue, 1991; Lynn & Sherman,\n2000)  have  all  conducted  significant  research  on  the  social  and  contextual  forces affecting  hypnosis  as  they  interface  with  personal  variables.

        "text": "As  described  briefly  in  the  previous  chapter,  the  experience  of  hypnosis  has  been conceptualized by some as an altered state or states of consciousness featuring absorption and  shifts  in  perception  (Tart,  1969;  Tellegen  &  Atkinson,  1974).  In  this  primarily intrapersonal  perspective,  hypnosis  is  considered  to  be  a  unique  and  separate  state  of consciousness, relative to one's 'normal' state of consciousness. The hypnotic state, in this  view,  is  created  by  the  hypnotic  induction  process,  which  alters  the  person's consciousness through the narrowing of attention to the offered suggestions. The altered state is thought to feature reduced defenses, greater emotional access and responsiveness, and greater access to unconscious processes (J. Barber, 1991; Nash, 1991).\nThis  view  of  hypnosis  as  a  distinctly  altered  state,  or  perhaps  altered  states,  has historically been  popular  because  of  its recognition that people  in hypnosis  can experience  things  seemingly  beyond  their  usual  capacity.  The  idea  of  altered  states  of consciousness conveniently allows for that possibility,  and  also  allows  for  the  variable proportion  of  people  who  can  experience  such  states  as  described  in  susceptibility statistics.\nDespite  its  early  popularity  and  seeming  obviousness,  the  view  of  hypnosis  as  an altered state of consciousness has less utility than other conceptual frameworks. Unique physiological correlates of hypnosis have not been found, and hypnotic phenomena can be produced without the benefit of hypnotic induction (Lynn & Rhue, 1991).\nThe  term  'altered  states  of  consciousness'  is,  like  'hypnosis,'  very  imprecise. Consciousness is a subjective experience. What is 'normal consciousness' relative to an 'altered  state  of  consciousness'?  Aren't  I  altering  your  consciousness  with  each  word, each page you read? WAIT! Think of a purple elephant with green ears! Did I just alter your consciousness? How much? Any time your awareness is shifted from one stimulus to another, your consciousness has been altered. The question, then, is this: If hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness, what is it altered from? Yet, when a hypnotized person experiences his or her body as numb, that is not a routine experience. Clearly, something has changed, but what and how it changed remain a mystery.\nRecently,  Cardeña  (manuscript  submitted  for  publication,  2003)  has  convincingly made the case for viewing hypnosis as reflective of altered states (plural) rather than a single altered state.",

        "text": "These  questions  are  answerable  by  you  because  you  are  able  to  use  your  visual, auditory, and tactile senses to gather information from the world around you. Consciously, but more so unconsciously, you are continually engaged in the processing of huge amounts of sensory input flooding your nervous system that tells you where you are relative to your immediate environment. Information is continuously coming to you through virtually all of your available senses, and all of these tiny bits of information give you a sense of where your body is, what position it is in, and how it is distanced from objects and outside experiences near and far. This is referred to as a 'generalized reality orientation' (Shor,  1959,  1970).  You  are  probably  not  consciously  aware  of  the sensations in your left shoulder until I draw your attention to it. Yet your shoulder (its nerves) is processing information, such as the gentle rub of your clothing against it, and that information is available to you consciously if you strive to notice it, or nonconsciously if you don't.\nObtaining feedback from our senses about the world around us and striving to validate its accuracy is a process called 'reality-testing.' Propo-nents of this primarily intrapersonal view claim that people are continually reality-testing in order to preserve personal integrity and alleviate the anxiety of uncertainty in not knowing our position in the world. This process is generally so unconscious we take it for granted. Ronald Shor, Ph.D., a pioneering contributor to hypnosis, described it this way:\nIn  all  our  waking  life  we  carry  around  in  the  background  of  our  awareness  a kind of frame of reference or orientation to generalized reality which serves as a context  or  arena  within  which  we  interpret  all  of  our  ongoing  conscious experiences.  Under  certain  conditions-of  which  hypnosis  is  just  one-this wide frame of reference or orientation to generalized reality can fade into the very distant background of our minds so that ongoing experiences are isolated from their usual context. When  that happens, the distinction between imagination and reality no longer exists for us. (1970, p. 91)\nHowever, if you have the experience of working with people deemed psychotic, you will often find them consciously and desperately engaged in reality-testing. In such individuals, reality-testing is evident in such activities as feeling the walls for guidance as they  walk,  touching  you  repeatedly  as  they  speak  to  you  to  make  sure  you  are  'real,' touching  themselves  to  assure  themselves  that  they  exist,  and  repeating  simple  causeeffect behaviors such as opening and closing a door apparently to show themselves they can affect their environment.\nThe process of sensation is simply the neurological response to a stimulus and is purely a biological phenomenon. Perception, however, is the interpretation of the neurological experience,  the  meaning  attached  to  a  sensation.  A  person's  perception  is  a  person's reality.  The  role  of  perception  on  experience  is  so  profound  that  it  literally  cannot  be overstated. Your perception of events is the determining factor in the course of action that you take. A false perception about a person or situation leads to a very different response than a more accurate perception might.\nThe reality-testing view of hypnosis theorizes that when someone is first entering and is then in hypnosis, his or her ongoing process of reality-testing is affected, perhaps by an",

When someone suspends the process of obtaining feedback from the world around him or her by focusing inwardly as is characteristic of most (but not all) hypnotic  experiences,  the  person  is  minimally  oriented  to  much  other  than  internal experience (Hilgard, 1986). The suspension of objective reality-testing frees the person to accept  whatever  reality  is  suggested.  The  suggested  reality,  like  any  perceived  reality, whether true or false, will determine the quantity and quality of behavioral and emotional responses.  As  Sheehan  and  McConkey  (1982)  showed,  however,  affirmed  in  later research by Lynn, Weekes, and Milano (1989), suspending or reducing reality-testing in order  to  accept  suggestions  for  perceptual  shifts  does  not  preclude  reality  awareness. People in hypnosis retain the ability to monitor and, if necessary, respond to situational realities and cues.\nLiving in San Diego as I do, and as the majority of my clients do, I can do hypnotic processes such as one involving relaxing at the beach if I care to, since most people here are  familiar  with  and  enjoy  that  experience.  The  hypnotic  suggestions  might  involve incorporating all the sights, smells, sounds, tastes, and tactile experiences associated with being at the beach into the process in such great detail that the client can genuinely feel as if he or she is really at the beach. If I ask the person, 'Where are you right now?' he or she might well answer, 'The beach.' If I then ask, 'No, really, where are you right now?' the  person will almost surely say, 'Your office.' But, in doing hypnosis, the reality of being in my office several miles away from the beach is suspended long enough to accept suggestions related to the 'realities' of being at the ocean.\nThe  degree  to  which  the  client  is  successful  in  letting  go  of  the  need  to  have  an objective reality immediately at hand (a need whose strength is directly proportional to the  person's  degree  of  insecurity)  is  the  degree  to  which  the  person  can  accept  the suggested experience.",

        "text": "Three of the most advantageous properties of having evolved consciousness for us as a species are our ability to reason, ability to learn on multiple dimensions of experience, and ability to communicate about experience (Brown, 1991).\nMany animal species communicate; complex behaviors such as competition for social position and such dynamic needs as territoriality are examples of routine communications in  the  animal  world.  In  recent  years,  interspecies  communication  has  been  attempted between  human  and  dolphin,  human  and  ape,  and  humans  and  other  species.  These attempts at communication have had marginal success, due in large part to the limited capacity (according to the human perspective) of animals, evidenced in their inability to invent symbols, using only the symbols provided for them.\nEvolution has allowed us to attach words to experience and thus represent experience abstractly.  Instead  of  our  communication  concretely  being  tied  to  a  current  need  or\nexperience,  we  can  communicate  about  things  that  occurred  millions  of  years  ago  or about things yet to come centuries from now.\nLanguage  and  communication  will  be  discussed  repeatedly  throughout  this  book. When we seek to evolve a theoretical perspective for the various phenomena of hypnosis, the  recognition  of  the  role  of  your  words  as  triggers  for  complex,  multidimensional, nonvolitional,  focused,  socially  responsive,  contextually  valid  (did  you  get  all  that?) experience  is  absolutely  crucial  to  the  attainment  of  sophistication  with  hypnotic techniques.  Hypnosis  encompasses  so  many  variables,  but  my  ultimate  aim  with  this book is to help you evolve a framework for being able to say something to your clients that will help. Regardless of theoretical orientation, I know of no one who would suggest that what you say to the client is unimportant. How do mere words, those sequences of sound you produce, attain such power?\nYou are reading this book, specifically this page with lots of black ink marks all over it in  various  configurations.  The  patterns  of  configuration  form  what  you  have  come  to recognize (from years of learning and experience) as words. As you read each word in a fixed left-to-right sequence, line by line, you are taking the words and attaching them to your  experience  of  what  they  represent  to  you.  The  words  on  this  page  don't  mean anything at all to you until you attach a meaning to them, and the meaning can come from nowhere other than your own experience of having learned what experiences the words represent.  Without  your  attaching  meaning  to  the  words,  the  words  on  this  page  are meaningless. When you see the lines and squiggles of written words or hear the sounds of words  from  a  language  that  is  unfamiliar  to  you,  those  markings  and  sounds  are meaningless  because  you  have  no  internal  frame  of  reference  for  understanding  them. Meaning is in you, not in the words themselves. And, since you use your own individual experience  to  attach  meaning  to  a  word,  you  can  appreciate  how  the  same  word  will inevitably mean different things to different people. The more abstract a word, meaning the more room for individual projection, the more this is true.\nExercises suggested throughout this book will help make this point clearer to you, but you  have  probably  already  had  experiences  in  which  your  interpretation  of  a  word  or phrase  differed  from  another  person's  interpretation  sufficiently  to  make  you  wonder whether  that  person  was  from  this  planet.  The  differences  in  interpretation  between people  account  for  most  communication  problems  in  whatever  context  problems  exist. My idea of what the 'right' thing for you to do may be very different from your idea is of what the 'right' thing to do is.\nIn the practice of clinical hypnosis, you need to be sensitive to the words and phrases you use because of the idiosyncratic nature of your client's interpretation. The phrase that works well in helping you develop relaxation, for example, may sound like fingernails on a chalkboard to your client. The word that fits well for your understanding of a particular kind of experience may represent something entirely different to your client.\nWords  are  conditioned  stimuli  representing  internal  experience  (Watzlawick,  1978). Gestures  are  also  conditioned  stimuli  arising  from  socialized  experiences  (e.g.,  head nods, hand gestures). Ultimately, though, people are unique individuals, each communicating in his or her own way. Thus, flexible communication both expects and allows clients to interpret and respond in their own unique ways.\nThe  model  of  hypnosis  regarding  the  conditioning  property  of  words  and  the",

        "text": "experiences words represent is a valuable one in explaining hypnotic experiences. The process  of  attaching  words  to  experience  in  linguistics  is  called  'transderivational search,'  and  has  been  a  subject  of  considerable  study  in  that  field.  How  experiences create habitual response patterns has been described in numerous places, and generally operates  on  various  principles  of  learning  and  reward  structures.  Basically,  people  do what  they  are  reinforced  (rewarded)  for  doing;  the  reward  may  be  the  comfort  of familiarity from having done something the same way before (even if it appears to be a useless or harmful behavior), the favorable reaction of people nearby, the attainment of a goal, or literally countless other possible reinforcements.\nResponses  may  be  conditioned,  'wired-in'  so  to  speak,  on  the  basis  of  a  single experience. Behaviors  have  emotional  counterparts  and  emotions  have  behavioral counterparts and physical responses occur with each, thus creating the holistic nature of the mind-body  relationship.  In  hypnosis,  the  conditioning  property  of  words  and experience  is  apparent  both  in  the  process  of  the  transderivational  search  the  client undergoes (in attaching the clinician's words to experience), and the resulting physical, emotional, and sensory changes that occur while the client is mentally absorbed. These changes, subtle but present, occur quite naturally all of the time, but are accentuated in hypnosis (Zeig & Rennick, 1991). When listening to someone describe the pleasure they had in eating at a good restaurant, why do you get hungry, salivate, and want to go to that restaurant  at  the  first  available  opportunity?  The  experience  of  transderivational  search involves you in attaching their words to experiences of pleasurable eating, and while your mind  is  absorbed  to  whatever  degree,  you  react  to  the  mental  experience  on  motoric, sensory, and affective levels automatically and, to a large degree, unconsciously.\nThe motoric, or physical, response is called an 'ideomotor response,' and is a basic feature of hypnotic processes you will be exposed to later. The ideomotor response is one of several automatic responses collectively called the 'ideodynamic' responses. Automatic thoughts are called ideocognitions, automatic sensory associations are called 'ideosensory' responses, and au-tomatic emotional associations are called 'ideoaffective' responses (Gilligan, 1987).\nThe relationship between mind and body is a close and powerful one. How the medical establishment  was  able  to  successfully  separate  mental  involvement  from  physical treatment for so long has continued to be a mystery to me, but I am greatly encouraged by the movement toward a reintegration of all the human resources available to people in the process  of  healing.  The  more  research  is  done  exploring  the  merits  of  hypnosis  with treating medical illness, the more we learn the power of words and ideas in healing.\nTransderivational search and ideodynamic processes are deceptively simple but highly sophisticated characteristics of communication in general and hypnosis in particular. The inevitable role of personal experience in attaching meaning to words accounts for a great deal  of  the  individuality  and  uniqueness  of  each  person's  response  to  hypnosis.  This primarily intrapersonal model does not, however, consider the relationship and situational dynamics that are inevitably a part of all hypnotic work.",

        "text": "In older views of hypnosis, the induction of hypnosis was something a hypnotist 'did to' a  subject  with  specific  incantations  or  prepared  scripts.  The  late  psychiatrist,  Milton H.Erickson, M.D., is widely credited with transforming the clinical practice of hypnosis from  such ritualistic approaches  to a more  refined hypnosis defined in broader interactional terms (Haley, 1973; Zeig, 1980). His methods have collectively come to be called  Ericksonian  approaches,  or,  synonymously,  utilization  approaches  (Erickson  & Rossi, 1979; Rossi, 1980) Hypnosis, in this view, is a result of a focused and meaningful interaction  between  clinician  and  client.  The  clinician,  to  be  successful,  must  be responsive to the needs of the client and tailor his or her approach to those needs if the client is going to be at all responsive to the possibilities for change the clinician makes available. The relationship is one of mutual interdependence, each following the other's leads while, paradoxically, at the same time leading.\nThe idea that the participants in the relationship are both leader and follower is a key point in this theoretical perspective. A client's behaviors and/or feelings are fed back to him or her verbally and/or nonverbally, thereby creating a sense in the client of being understood-the  essence  of  rapport.  Tied  to  verbalizations  of  what  he  or  she  is experiencing  as  true  are  respectful  suggestions  of  what can become  true.  Instead  of imposing on clients the clinician's belief system of what they should do, the possibility is made available to them of something progressive they can do in their own way and at their own rate.\nMore will be said later on this idea of accepting and utilizing client behavior, but the important  point  here  in  describing  this  theoretical  perspective  is  that  hypnosis  is considered a natural outcome of a relationship where each participant is responsive to the sensitive following and leading of the other. Thus, the generally undesirable approach of imposing your beliefs and values on your client is avoided to whatever degree is humanly possible. (I think it is impossible to entirely avoid the sharing of your values, and I also believe that, in some cases, it is quite desirable to openly make your values available to the client as a model to consider.)\nThe interactional view emphasizes responsiveness and respect for the client, which is ideal  in  therapeutic  contexts.  However,  clearly  these  factors  need  not  be  present  for hypnosis to occur. After all, the stage show hypnotist has no special personal relationship to his or her subjects, and is certainly not sensitive or responsive to their unique personal characteristics and personalities, yet can still obtain hypnotic responses from them.",

Major  funding went  to  brain  and  drug  research,  and  the  landscape  of  mental  health  treatment  in particular has been forever transformed as a result. Drug treatment in particular has, in\nmany cases, seemingly relegated psychotherapy to a secondary position.\nThe new technologies for studying the brain and nervous system did not escape the notice of the hypnosis community. In the next chapter, I will detail some of the findings about the cognitive neuroscience of hypnosis. These findings have been a consequence of the  influence  of  those  theorists  who  have  suggested  hypnosis  is  best  understood  as  a neurological  or  psychobiological  phenomenon  (Bányai,  1991;  Rossi,  2000;  Spiegel  & Spiegel, 1987).\nPsychologist Ernest Rossi, Ph.D., has been an especially prolific researcher and writer in the area of the mind-body relationship in hypnosis and the physiological correlates to hypnotic  experience.  Rossi  (1982)  proposed  that  hypnosis  was  a  natural  part  of  the body's  regularly  alternating  cycles  of  attentiveness  and  relaxation  called  'ultradian rhythms'  that  occur  every  90-150  minutes.  More  recently,  continuing  his  research  on hypnosis  and  physiology,  Rossi  has  been  focused  on  the  potential  for  neurogenesis  as well as hypnotic influence at the genetic level (2001).\nPsychiatrists  Herbert  Spiegel  and  David  Spiegel  (1987)  hypothesized  that  hypnotic abilities are the product of the interrelationship of the brain hemispheres. Together they evolved  a  'biological  marker'  assessment  in  the  form  of  an  eye-roll  test  (described  in chapter 11) to indicate an individual's hypnotic susceptibility.\nFrom  his  study  of  what  he  calls  'broken  brains,'  famed  neuroscientist  Michael Gazzaniga, Ph.D., evolved what he called a 'modular unit' model of the brain (1985). While not specific to  hypnosis, it provides a  neuroscientific basis for many of the key phenomena  of  hypnosis,  particularly  dissociation.  Gazzaniga  described  how  different portions  of  the  brain  can  function  together  but  can  also  function  autonomously.  These separate but related sets of neurons, which he termed modular units, can each have their 'triggers,' creating experiences, or, more accurately, perceptions of experiences that are modifiable with input from other sources. For example, a person goes to a party, has a good time and goes to bed feeling perfectly fine. He or she wakes up feeling depressed the next morning, and naturally strives to understand why. The modular units for mood may have been activated by a dream, but since the person doesn't know that, he or she starts to hypothesize (e.g., 'Maybe I was upset about that joke the others made about me that I thought I had just laughed off. But, maybe I was really hurt by it and just didn't know it')  Gazzaniga  terms  ours  'The  Social  Brain'  for  its  reliance  on  social  cues  for making  meaning  of  our  experience.  It  could  reasonably  be  said  that  hypnosis  is  a condensed  form  of  such  interaction: Accessing  modular  units of the brain with suggestions and organizing them in therapeutic configurations.",

In  just considering 'simple' or routine tasks, like remembering your address or deciding what you'd like to have for lunch, the brain is a marvel. When you go beyond the simple tasks to consider the ability of a gifted musician to play from memory thousands of notes on a piano  or  a  guitar  in  a  specific  sequence  and  rhythm  while  coordinating  the  necessary finger movements at lightning speeds, or consider the mastery of complex and abstract principles  and  formulas  of  physics  and  chemistry  in  order  to  place  a  human  being  in space and bring him or her back again safely, the talents of the brain are truly spectacular.\nThe  brain,  until  recently,  has  been  thought  of  as  a  'black  box,'  an  unknown  and seemingly unknowable entity that runs all of our mental and even many of our physical processes. As a 'black box,' the brain's functions could only be inferred from studying people  with  gross  abnormalities,  ones  that  were  pervasive  enough  to  show  up  on relatively  crude  scanning  and  measuring  devices.  Or,  they  could  be  inferred  from evaluating the consequences of invasive brain procedures, such as the dramatic surgeries separating the brain hemispheres (called cerebral commissurotomies) of severely epileptic  patients,  and then assessing functional differences arising from the procedure. Thus, learning about the inner workings of the human brain was (and still is) limited to what was and is technologically possible.\nWhat is technologically possible, however, has changed dramatically in recent years, and the advances in technologies for observing the brain in action have changed the face of  neuropsychophysiological  research.  The  brain  is  a  'black  box'  no  longer.  Brain research has proliferated during the last decade and continues to do so even now as newer brain  research  technologies  continue  to  evolve.  These  allow  us  an  unprecedented opportunity to study detailed aspects of brain functioning never before possible. To study the changes in a person's brain from microsecond to microsecond as he or she engages in some  specific  activity,  such  as  listening  to  music  or  reading  a  book,  measuring  these changes  in  'real  time,'  and  determining  where  such  changes  may  take  place,  is remarkable.  These  new  technologies,  and  newer  ones  still  being  developed,  hold  the potential  to  answer  many  of  the  most  basic  questions  about  ourselves,  such  as  what physically drives our thoughts, feelings, behavior, and what constitutes the physical basis for conscious experience and unconscious processes under various conditions.\nHypnosis  poses  a  special  challenge  to  our  understandings  of  the  brain.  In  hypnosis, there are cognitive, physical, and behavioral changes that occur that generally manifest as a greater responsiveness to suggested experiences. And, these occur in an interpersonal context in which one person performs an induction on another. Not everyone is equally responsive to hypnotic procedures, though. Researchers separate subjects into groups of\nso-called 'high hypnotizables' and 'low hypnotizables' by formally testing for responsiveness  to  suggested  experiences  (see  chapter  11 on  this  subject).  By  focusing brain  research  on  those  who  appear  to  have  greater  presumed  hypnotic  capacity, researchers attempt to address such questions as these: Is hypnosis a specific state in the realm  of  human  experience?  Is  there  a  physiological  correlate  to  the  experience  of hypnosis? If there is, can it be identified and measured? And, if there is one, what might it  mean to the clinician applying hypnosis in treatment? In this chapter, I will describe some  of  the  current  research  on  the  neuropsychophysiology  of  hypnosis,  highlighting some of the important findings and what they may imply for clinical practice.",

        "text": "The  obvious  answer  to  this  question  must  nonetheless  be  stated  directly:  The  brain  is instrumental  in  generating  the  experience  of  hypnosis  as  well  as  the  various  hypnotic phenomena derived through hypnosis. As the principal organ of information processing, sensation, perception, volition, memory, imagination, and all the countless other mental processes  it  controls,  understanding  the  brain  holds  the  promise  for  providing  us  with information that is vital to better understanding ourselves, and better understanding ways to improve the human condition.\nHelen J.Crawford, Ph.D., of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, is one of the leading researchers in the field of neuropsychophysiology today. (See her Frame of Reference section later in this chapter.) She has been intensively studying the phenomenon of hypnosis for well over a decade, publishing some of the key research in the  field  (Crawford,  1990,  2001;  Crawford  &  Gruzelier,  1992;  Crawford,  Kapelis,  & Harrison, 1995; Crawford, Clarke, & Kitner-Triolo, 1996a; Crawford, Corby, & Kopell, 1996b). For Dr. Crawford, the goals in studying the physiology of hypnosis are clear: 'I want to take hypnosis out of the realm of mysticism and bring it into the realm of science, and  I  want  to  reduce  the  myths  and  misunderstandings  about  hypnosis'  (personal communication, June 17, 2002). These are obviously very important goals, whether you are a brain researcher or a clinician introducing hypnosis as a treatment alternative to a new client. Choosing to use hypnosis or any other tool of treatment is a choice that can be made with relevant data.\nWhat makes it possible for someone to focus intently on a quiet induction process in a noisy room? What makes it possible for someone to focus on a suggested sensation of numbness that allows him or her to undergo a surgery without the use of any chemical anesthesia? As researchers strive to understand the cascade of neurophysiological events that take place when one person tells another to 'just relax and listen to my words,' the quality  of  research  questions  grows  more  complicated,  and  the  quality  of  research methods designed to answer such questions grows more sophisticated.\nIt  is  often  the  case  in  life  that  the  quality  of  your  questions  significantly  affects  the quality of the answers you get. What are some of the questions researchers studying the brains  of  hypnotized  individuals  want  to  know  the  answers  to?  Pause  for  a  moment before you read on and think about what questions you would want to know the answers to  about  the  brain  in  hypnosis.  Here  are  some  of  the  most  basic  questions  brain\nresearchers try to answer:\nAre  there  morphological  differences  between  the  brains  of  high  and  low hypnotizables?\nAre there cognitive differences between high and low hypnotizables that have a neuropsychophysiological basis?\nAre there physiological correlates of the hypnotic state that can be identified and measured?\nAre  neurophysiologically  measurable  state  changes  a  cause  or  reflection  of the hypnotic experience?\nTo what extent do the neurophysiological data reflect the hypnotic induction process(es) used rather than the hypnotic state itself?\nHow  does  a  suggestion  get  converted  into  a  (cognitive,  behavioral,  or physical) response?\nSomething changes during the experience of hypnosis: Before the induction procedure, the research subject could focus on nothing but the pain in his or her arm. Following the induction procedure and some direct suggestions for numbness (e.g., 'your arm will feel completely and comfortably numb as all the sensation seems to drain out of it'), the pain is  all  but  gone  from  the  person's  awareness. Something has  changed-but what? Has research  fully  answered  this  basic  yet  very  complex  question  for  us?  Currently,  the answer is no. But, quite a bit has already been learned about what changes in the brain, and more is being learned about brain functioning all the time that can help lead us one step at a time in the direction of (we hope) being able to fully answer the question of what changes as well as the other questions posed above.\nAs  you  can  infer,  the  underlying  premise  in  much  of  the  brain  research  involving hypnosis has been that there is a specific measurable state called 'hypnosis' even though it  has  not  yet  been  identified  and  defined  biologically.  In  fact,  André  Weitzenhoffer, Ph.D., a leading proponent of the belief that there is a distinct hypnotic state yet to be discovered  and  measured,  wrote,  'The only argument  with  some  weight  that  has  been offered  against  accepting  the  reality  of  hypnosis  is  the  impossibility  thus  far  to  find consistent and meaningful physiological correlates of the state.' He goes on to ask, 'But have  we  found  physiological  correlates  of  other  mental  activities  whose  reality  is  not questioned?'  (2000,  p.  224).  For  Weitzenhoffer  and  many  researchers,  there  is  a condition  called  'hypnosis'  that must exist  in  an  objectively  provable  way.  (See  the Frame  of  Reference  with  Dr.  Weitzenhoffer  in  chapter  2.)  The  assumption  is  that  our current  technologies,  sophisticated  as  they  might  be,  are  simply  not  yet  sufficiently advanced  to  fully  achieve  the  task.  What  technologies  have  been  used  to  study  the neuropsychophysiology of hypnosis?",

Each of these has a different means of assessing brain functions, thus yielding distinct though related findings. A comprehensive review of the large body of neuropsychophysiological data is beyond the scope of this chapter. (For an excellent review of such literature, see Crawford, 2001.) However, it would be valuable to look at a few  of  the  approaches  to  assessing  brain  function  and  consider  some  of  the  recent findings.",

        "text": "Electrical  activity  of  the  brain  is  recorded  from  electrodes  placed  on  the  scalp.  The brain's  relatively  weak  electrical  signal  is  amplified  and  then  de-composed  into  its frequency  components.  The  traditional  frequency  bands  studied  are theta (4-8  Hz.), alpha (8-13  Hz.), beta (17-30  Hz.),  and gamma (30-60  Hz.).  Electrode  locations  are designated  according  to  the  corresponding  brain  areas  (e.g.,  F=frontal,  T=temporal, C=central, P=parietal, and O=occipital). Odd numbers refer to the left side of the brain, even  numbers  refer  to  the  right  side  of  the  brain,  and  'z'  is  the  designation  for  the midline (Ray, 1997).\nSome of the earliest brain research regarding hypnosis involved use of the EEG. For example, in the early days of hypnosis some eminent theorists and practitioners held the view that hypnosis was a special form of sleep. In fact, there are still hypnotists today who  will  instruct  their  clients  to  'Sleep  deeply!'  as  a  part  of  their  induction  process, despite its obvious incorrectness as an instruction to experience hypnosis since hypnosis is not sleep. Such outmoded terminology is simply a carryover from the early days when the misconception of hypnosis as sleep was commonly held. (Related to the 'hypnosis as sleep'  perspective  is  the  misconception  that  someone  in  hypnosis  is  unconscious  and unaware of whatever is going on.) EEG research in the late 1940s (Gordon, 1949) and subsequent replications with everimproving EEG equipment made it clear that the EEG pattern  of  sleep  was  distinctly  different  from  the  wakeful  and  aware  EEG  patterns  of hypnosis.\nEEG  Frequency  Analysis  today  tends  to  focus  on  the  issue  of  band  frequencies associated with hypnosis, specifically the question of whether one band frequency, such as alpha or theta, is most representative of the hypnotized brain. Early studies in this area suggested that hypnosis is an 'alpha state' (London, Hart, & Leibovitz, 1968; Nowlis & Rhead, 1968). This notion was widely popularized, even leading to 'higher consciousness'  workshops  on  learning  to  generate  alpha  rhythms  and  the  creation  of special 'alpha wave synchronizing' machines made commercially available to help you do so. However, hypnosis is not simply an 'alpha state.' The research on alpha waves as an  indicator  of  hypnosis  is  quite  ambiguous,  but  some  research  regarding  alpha  waves suggests they may indeed have some relationship to hypnotic susceptibility either before or  during  hypnosis (Williams & Gruzelier, 2001). Future research will be necessary to clarify this point.\nEarlier EEG  research  has  been  criticized on a number  of  counts: Inadequate\nestablishment of hypnotic susceptibility profiles of research subjects, limited number of electrode placements on the scalp, and poor amplification and signal-processing capabilities of the equipment (Perlini & Spanos, 1991; Ray, 1997). Newer EEG research, however,  is  considerably  more  sophisticated  (there  are  now  multi-channel  recording technologies and  more  refined signal-processing capabilities available) which  has obviated many of the previous problems.\nStudies of EEG brain-wave activity tend to show that the theta band is associated with higher levels of hypnotic susceptibility both in eyes-open and eyes-closed pre-hypnosis baselines and also during the induction of hypnosis (Crawford, 1990, 2001; Graffin, Ray, &  Lundy,  1995;  Ray,  1997;  Ray,  Blai,  Aikins,  Coyle,  &  Bjick,  1998).  Theta  is  also associated with focused attention (Schachter, 1977), clearly a necessary component of the hypnotic  experience.  Thus,  as  individuals  enter  hypnosis,  EEG  theta  power  tends  to increase.  This  increase  may  be  observed  in  low  hypnotizables  as  well  as  highs,  but  is more  pronounced  in  highs  (Crawford,  1990,  2001;  Sabourin,  Cutcomb,  Crawford,  & Pribram,  1990).  However,  research  by  Williams  and  Gruzelier  (2001)  suggests  that increased theta is not a trait index of hypnotic susceptibility, though it may be one for simple  relaxation.  Thus,  although  theta  seems  likely  to  be  positively  associated  with hypnosis, current research findings remain equivocal.\nThere is another EEG 'marker' that is currently receiving a great deal of interest from researchers. It is the so-called '40 Herz band.' The 40 Herz band is a high frequency, low amplitude EEG rhythm that centers around 40 Herz that is associated with a condition of focused attentional arousal (Crawford, 2001). DePascalis and Penna (1990) reported that high hypnotizables showed greater 40 Herz production in their right hemispheres during hypnosis,  while  low  hypnotizables  showed  reduced  activity  in  both  brain  hemispheres during  hypnosis.  DePascalis  and  colleagues  (1987,  1989,  1998)  also  showed  that  high hypnotizables, compared to lows, both in waking and hypnosis conditions, have a greater capacity  to  access  both  positive  and  negative  life-emotional  experiences,  a  capacity associated to task-related hemispheric shifts of fast EEG activity in the 40 Herz band. It has been suggested that the 40 Herz band is the physiological marker of focused arousal (Sheer, 1989), which, presumably, further research will either affirm or deny.\nRiding the wave of popular interest in the so-called 'split brain' patients who had the corpus callosum connecting their two brain hemispheres surgically severed (Gazzaniga, 1970;  Sperry,  1968),  the  theory  of  a  hemispheric  asymmetry  was  proposed  to  explain hypnosis and hypnotic phenomena (Watzlawick, 1978). The theory suggested, despite no hypnosis-specific objective evidence to support it at the time, that hypnosis was a process involving  'blocking  the  left  hemisphere'  while  utilizing  'right-hemispheric  language patterns.' Some went a step further and even declared the right hemisphere the 'location' of  the  unconscious,  an  incorrect  position  in  light  of  current  data  which  shows  a distribution of brain functions-conscious and unconscious-in  both  hemispheres (Crawford & Gruzelier, 1992).\nIs there a hemispheric asymmetry in hypnosis? There is evidence to suggest the answer is yes. Is it the right or left hemisphere that is dominant in hypnosis? The answer appears to be neither and both. Neither one dominates as a reliable force in hypnosis, and either one can dominate depend-ing on the specific task assigned to it. The same can be said to be true in nonhypnotic conditions. Highly hypnotizable individuals seem to show greater\nemotional arousal, faster emotional arousal, and greater EEG activity in the right parietal region (Crawford et al., 1995, 1996a; Gruzelier, 1998; Heller, 1993).\nGruzelier  (1998)  proposed  a  three-stage  model  of  the  neuropsycho-physiology  of hypnosis that features cerebral asymmetric changes in the process. In the first stage there is  increased frontal lobe activity in the left hemisphere associated with focusing on the hypnotist's voice. In the second stage, there is a frontolimbic inhibitory process as the hypnotized  individual  'lets  go.'  The  third  stage  is  marked  by  the  person  showing  a 'redistribution  of  functional  activity  and  an  augmentation  of  posterior  cortical  activity, particularly of the right hemisphere in high susceptibles' (p. 2). Gruzelier claimed low hypnotizables  fail  to  show  engagement  in  either  or  both  of  the  first  two  stages. DePascalis  (1998)  came  to  a  similar  conclusion,  showing  that  early  in  the  hypnotic induction the left hemisphere was more active, but as the induction progressed the left hemisphere's activity was inhibited.\nThe issue of frequency bands associated with hypnosis is a charged one as researchers hope and strive to identify the physiological markers of hypnosis. It has become charged in another way as well, as an applied newer technology involving brain waves draws the interest of both researchers and clinicians. Popularly known as 'neurofeedback,' but also known as EEG biofeedback, the premise of neurofeedback is that much of psychopathology can be attributed to problems in brain timing, specifically the person's brain waves being 'off' (disruptions in brain self-regulation called dysrhythmias). Selfregulatory  deficits  have  been  associated  by  proponents  of  neurofeedback  to  various symptom patterns, such as various arousal disorders (e.g., anxiety), attention disorders, mood  disorders, seizure disorder, and specific learning deficits (Sterman, 1996). Neurofeedback  involves  brain  exercises  that  are  directed  at  teaching  the  individual  to self-correct their brain wave patterns. The presumption is that if you correct the brain, the person's  problems  may  correct  as  well.  Research  has  shown  that  brain  waves  may  be retrained  on  an  operant  conditioning  basis,  and  there  are  now  some  studies  suggesting that  neurofeedback  may  be  a  viable  treatment  for  disorders  such  as  those  mentioned earlier (Lubar, 1995; Sterman, 2000). Barabasz and Barabasz (1996) described the use of neurofeedback  with  alert  hypnosis  in  the  treatment  of  attention  deficit  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research on EEG conditioning and possible associated neurobehavioral changes is ongoing, and given the relative newness of the technology, future research will help determine its ultimate worth as a means of intervention.\nRecently  another  strategy  to  manipulate  brain  wave  patterns  for  the  purpose  of improving both hypnotizability and clinical symptom presentations has been investigated, called  EEG entrainment. Unlike neurofeedback which encourages self-regulation, EEG entrainment involves the use of a stimulus, binaural-beat sound stimulation, to drive the brain. Binaural-beat sound stimulation is part of a brainwave changing process that may also include breathing exercises, guided relaxation, imagery processes and binaural beats (Atwater,  1995).  A  binaural  beat  takes  place  when  two  different  sound  waveforms  are presented stereophonically through headphones to a subject who will have the subjective perception of a third 'beat' frequency occurring due to the difference between the two soundwaves.  The  effects of listening to the binaural beats may  be  subjectively experienced as relaxing or stimulating, depending on the frequencies used. In a study by Brady  &  Stevens  (2000),  binaural-beat  sound  stimulation  was  utilized  to  attempt  to",

        "text": "One of the relatively recent developments in EEG technology is the study of the EEG patterns of the individual either while he or she is listening to or watching some stimulus (called  an  exogenous  or  evoked  potential),  or  psychologically  responding  to  some stimulus (called an endogenous potential). These stimuli are called events, and the brain's electrical changes (a series of peaks and troughs) in response to these events are called event-related potentials, or ERPs. To get an accurate read of an ERP, a stimulus must be presented many times, then the researcher averages the EEG time-locked to the stimulus presentation  in  order  to  reduce  any  random  background  brain  activity  to  zero.  By measuring the time it takes for an ERP to occur after the presentation of some stimulus, and by taking multiple recordings from various areas of the brain (the more electrodes that are placed, the better to determine where activity is taking place), it becomes possible to  determine  the  sequence  and  the  timing  of  the  areas  in  the  brain  activated  by  the stimulus.\nAn endogenous ERP that has been studied extensively is known as the P300, or, in EEG shorthand, a P3 wave. It is typically seen in response to either rare or meaningful stimuli, and appears at about 300 milliseconds after the presentation of the stimulus. (It may take longer, perhaps as long as 1,000 milliseconds, depending on the complexity of the stimulus.)\nERPs have been studied extensively in relation to hypnosis for their potential as either markers  distinguishing  brain  activity  in  low  and  high  hypnotizables  in  waking  and hypnosis conditions or at least as reflectors of underlying processes. ERPs are affected by information-processing strategies that arise in response to the type of task demanded of the  person,  as  well  as  the  emotional  aspect  of  a  stimulus,  such  as  surprise  (DuncanJohnson  &  Donchin,  1980).  Thus,  studying  ERPs  in  studies  of  hypnotic  alterations  of perception  and  emotional  states  has  been  a  fruitful  avenue  of  research  (Barabasz  & Lonsdale,  1983;  Crawford  et  al.,  1996b;  De  Pascalis,  1994).  Two  recent  studies  in particular  (Barabasz  et  al.,  1999;  Jensen,  Barabasz,  Barabasz,  &  Warner,  2001)  were quite  persuasive  in  showing  that  when  subjects  were  carefully  chosen  and  grouped  for hypnotizability,  and  suggestions  were  carefully  worded,  the  ERPs  showed  significant differences between groups, supporting the notion of identifiable alterations in consciousness in hypnosis.\nMore specific are the somatosensory event-related potentials (SEPs) which have been studied in relation to human pain responses. As Crawford (2001) reported, hypnotically suggested  analgesia  results  in  significant  decreases  in  the  later  SEP  components  (100 msec  or  later  after  stimulus)  in  hypnotically  responsive  patients.  This  suggests  an inhibitory process that affects the anterior cingulated cortex, a portion of the brain known to show increased activation during pain. (Continued on page 93)",

        "text": "Helen, J.Crawford, Ph.D. (1943-), is professor of psychology and director of the Psychological Sciences Graduate Program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia. Dr. Crawford is one of the  most  highly  visible  and  influential  researchers  in  the  field,  having published dozens of scientific articles and book chapters on complex aspects of the neuropsychophysiology  of  hypnosis.  Dr.  Crawford  received  her doctoral degree in experimental psychology in 1974 from the University of California, Davis. From 1975 to 1978, Dr. Crawford was a research assistant in the Laboratory of Hypnosis Research in the Department of Psychology at Stanford  University,  under  the  leadership  of  Dr.  Ernest  Hilgard,  a  leading figure in hypnosis and the subject of a Frame of Reference section in chapter 11.  Dr.  Crawford's  work  is  known  internationally,  and  she  has  been  an invited  Visiting  Professor  and  Scholar  at  some  very  prestigious  institutions, including the Imperial College of Medicine in England, Aalborg University in Denmark, the University of Rome in Italy, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Her scholarly work has earned her a number of awards, including the  Bernard  B.Raginsky  Award  for  Leadership  and  Achievement  from  the Society  for  Clinical  and  Experimental  Hypnosis  for  being  a  'Distinguished Teacher,  Scientist,  and  Pioneer  in  the  Field  of  Hypnosis.'  Dr.  Crawford's enthusiasm for and\ncommitment to her research is a contagious force  when she  describes what she does, despite her scientific modesty that sometimes lends itself to pleasant understatement.\nO n  the  Biology  of  Hypnosis: 'There  are  physiological  changes  that accompany hypnosis. When a person is controlling pain, for example, there are shifts in frontal lobe involvement that interact with other systems in the brain.  It's  not  just  the  frontal  lobe.  With  our  fMRI,  we  see  changes  in  the anterior  cingulated.  It's  all  reflective  of  something  that's  differing-the person is cognitively processing, but in a different manner.'\nO n Whether Hypnosis Is a State or a Trait: 'There's a shift in cognitive processing  in  hypnosis.  I  think  the  use  of  the  term  'state'  is  dangerously inaccurate. There's a shift in conscious awareness and that's as much as I can say about it. I'm not in either a 'state' or 'trait' camp.'\nO n Using Physical Evidence of Hypnosis to Build Client Responsiveness: 'Most  people  know  very  little  other  than  what  is  in  the media,  and  they  have  many  misunderstandings  about  hypnosis.  So,  I  tell them,  'It  looks  as  if  hypnosis  is  focused  attention,'  and  then  I  make  an analogy  to  what  they  do  when  they're  focused.  In  the  process,  I'm  giving them facts about where I want to go with them. I explain that when a person\nis hypnotized, even though they're very relaxed, it appears as if the brain is quite active. Therefore, they have control over themselves, and they can make decisions  as  to  whether  they  want  to  participate  or  not.  It  really  goes  over very well…. They like the idea that they're getting more control.'\nO n Distinguishing Ability from Attitude: 'I make a distinction between ability  and  attitude.  I'm  not  one  of  the  advocates  who  says  everybody  is hypnotizable.  There's  a  range  of  responsiveness  in  people,  as  measured  by standardized scales. It's neurologically and genetically influenced. If someone is  interested  in  knowing  what  a  person's  responsiveness  is,  tests  can  help. And,  they  help  the  subjects  themselves  when  they  discover  they  have hypnotic ability.'\nO n  Going  beyond  Biology  into  the  Social  Context  of  Hypnosis: 'The relationship with the subject or client is highly important. If a subject doesn't trust  me,  they  won't  be  hypnotized.  You  have  to  develop  rapport  ahead  of time. When I walk into a classroom or a setting where hypnosis is involved, I'll  talk  to  them  for  10  or  15  minutes  before  I  ever  start  the  experimental hypnosis session. I'll tell them about hypnosis, address their beliefs and any misunderstandings, and I usually tell them\nabout working in the area of pain control, which I publish on. It gives them a feeling  that,  'Oh,  this  is  possible.'  It's  good  for  developing  rapport  and building expectancy.'\nO n  Why  Psychotherapists  Should  Know  about  Brain  Physiology: 'I think  the  more  you  know  about  brain  physiology  the  better  you  are  in recognizing  whether  your  patient's  problems  are  psychological  or  whether there might be some underlying neurological problem. I respect therapists a lot,  but  too  often  they  just  don't  understand  clinical  neuro-physiology,  and they miss physical reasons for their patient's problems. They need to be able to address the physical as well as the psychological.'\nSource: Personal communication, June 17, 2002.",

        "text": "First developed in the 1970s, PET measures the emission of positrons from the brain after the  subject  has  received  an  injection  into  the  bloodstream  of  a  small  amount  of radioactive  isotopes,  or  tracers.  The  tracers  allow  the  activity  of  different  parts  of  the brain to be measured by gauging the volume of blood flow to the region. As a region is activated,  the  amount  of  blood  flowing  to  that  region  increases.  By  gauging  the  blood flow  with  the  radioactive  tracers,  the  result  is  a  three-dimensional  map  with  different colors representing different levels of brain activity.\nA  number  of  studies  of  hypnotic  phenomena  have  been  done  using  PET  scan technology. In one study, Szechtman and his colleagues (1998) at McMaster University in Ontario,  Canada,  used  PET  to  image  the  brain  activity  of  high  hypnotizables\nprescreened for their ability to hallucinate in hypnosis who were given suggestions for an auditory  hallucination.  While  in  the  PET  scanner  with  their  eyes  covered,  the  subjects brain  activity  was  monitored  under  four  conditions:  (1)  at  rest;  (2)  while  presented  an audiotaped stimulus of a voice saying, 'The man did not speak often, but when he did, it was worth hearing what he had to say'; (3) while simply imagining the voice on the tape; and, (4) while hallucinating the voice after being told the tape was playing when, in fact, it was not.\nThe PET scans showed that a region of the brain called the right anterior cingulated cortex  was  equally  active  when  the  subjects  were  hallucinating  as  when  hearing  the actual taped voice. But, that same part of the brain was not active when the subjects were simply  imagining  the  voice  on  the  tape.  Remarkably,  the  brains  of  these  subjects  had registered the hallucinated voice as if it were real.\nIn  another  PET  study  of  hypnosis,  this  one  conducted  by  Pierre  Rainville  and  his colleagues at the University of Montreal (1997), the goal was to learn something about the  brain  structures  associated  with  relief  from  pain  during  hypnosis.  PET  scans  were done on hypnotized volunteers whose hands were immersed in painfully hot water. The somatosensory cortex, which processes painful stimuli, showed no significant differences when suggestions were given that either the water would be painfully hot or would be minimally unpleasant. But, the anterior cingulated cortex, a part of the brain known to be more  active  in  individuals  in  pain,  showed  much  less  activity  when  suggestions  were given that the water would be minimally unpleasant.\nA  third  study  using  PET  scan  technology,  one  that  received  considerable  media attention,  was  conducted  at  Harvard  University  by  Stephen  Kosslyn  and  his  associates (including David Spiegel, M.D., who is featured in a Frame of Reference in chapter 17) (Kosslyn,  Thompson,  Constantini-Ferrando,  Alpert,  &  Spiegel,  2000).  The  study  was designed  to  find  out  whether  hypnosis  could  be  used  to  modulate  color  perception. Research subjects chosen for their high hypnotizability were shown a series of patterns some involving  colors  and  some  only  shades  of  gray  while  in  waking  and  hypnotized conditions. Color stimuli were shown to be processed in a separate region than the gray stimuli are. Researchers suggested that the subjects visualize each image shown them as either  color  or  black  and  white  while  the  PET  scan  measured  brain  activity.  When subjects were hypnotized, the color areas of the brain were less active when told to see color as only gray, and likewise, the color areas were more active when told to see (i.e., hallucinate)  the  gray  stimulus  as  colorful.  The  brain  areas  used  to  perceive  color  were activated in both brain hemispheres, despite exposure only to shades of gray, just as they would  activate  when  genuinely  exposed  to  color  stimulus.  When  subjects  were  not  in hypnosis, and were told to simply visualize the colors, only the right hemisphere became active. Thus, the brains of hypnotized individuals responded to the suggested experiences rather  than  the  actual  stimuli  in  measurable  ways.  The  researchers  concluded  that hypnosis is a psychological state with distinct neural correlates.",

        "text": "Hypnosis clearly involves attentional processes, specifically selective focusing. Neuropsychological  studies  have  suggested  that  the  frontal  lobe  is  associated  with\nattentional functions (Stuss, Eskes, &  Foster, 1994). During hypnotic analgesia, Crawford,  Gur,  Skolnick,  Gur,  &  Benson  (1993)  showed  an  increased  cerebral  blood flow in the orbitofrontal cortex, which may be interpreted as a sign of greater attentional effort on the part of subjects. In fact, Gruzelier (1988,1990) and Crawford and Gruzelier (1992)  have  theorized  that  differences  in  hypnotizability  are,  at  least  in  part,  due  to varying capacities for attention across individuals, measurable with frontal lobe activation. Some behavioral research suggests that high hypnotizables have greater ability to  focus  and  to  sustain  their  focus  (Roche  &  McConkey,  1990).  However,  Kallio, Revonsuo, A., Hamalainen, Markela, & Gruzelier (2001) did not find any evidence of frontal differences between high and low hypnotizables.\nThe ability  of  the  hypnotized  person  to  focus  and  respond  nonvolitionally  has  often been deemed  an effortless process (Bowers, 1992; Ruehle &  Zamansky,  1997; Weitzenhoffer, 2000). Indeed, in the majority of hypnotic interactions, the client appears to be sitting passively and merely absorbing noncritically the suggestions of the clinician (or  researcher).  However,  despite  the  appearance  of  effortless  passivity,  the  client  is active,  participating  in  the  process,  and  searching  for  the  relevance  or  salience  of suggestions,  particularly  when  they  hold  the  potential  to  help  with  solving  personally distressing  problems.  These  observations  about  the  active  experience  of  the  client  in hypnosis  have  been  lent  substantial  support  in  recent  EEG  and  cerebral  blood  flow studies (Crawford, 1994; Crawford & Gruzelier, 1992) as well as psychological research (Kirsch,  Burgess,  &  Braffman,  1999)  which  show  that  hypnosis  involves  substantial cognitive effort.\nProblem solving, whether in the course of daily life or specifically in the context of attempting  to  resolve  troublesome  physical  and/or  psychological  symptoms,  requires some  degree  of  cognitive  flexibility.  Cognitive  flexibility  implies  an  ability  to  view  a situation from a variety of perspectives rather than only one (Beck et al., 1979), an ability to  refocus  attention  and  shift  cognitive  strategies,  and  other  abilities  such  as  vivid imagination  and  holistic  thinking  (Crawford  &  Gruzelier,  1992).  Cognitive  differences between  high  and  low  hypnotizables  have  been  documented  in  a  variety  of  studies (Spiegel & Spiegel, 1987; Wallace, 1990; Weitzenhoffer, 2000). High hypnotizables tend to have  greater  cognitive  flexibility,  more  focused  attention  involving  the  frontal attentional system, and greater capacity for emotional arousal (Crawford, 1989).",

        "text": "The technologies for being able to peer into the brain as it functions are relatively new ones, and each new technological innovation holds the promise to reveal ever more about how  our  brains  function  in  various  conditions.  The  fact  that  brain  research  involving hypnosis has sometimes shown contradictory findings should not come as a surprise to anyone. Similar contra-dictory findings are to be found in even less objective psychological research. Why is this so? There are many reasons:\nThe experience of hypnosis represents a subjective state that, at best, researchers try to define  and  quantify  in  some  way.  But,  subjective  states  cannot  easily  be  defined  or quantified.  If  I  say,  'I  love  chocolate,'  and  then  I  say,  'I  love  my  wife,'  will  we  find\nneurological correlates to these seemingly differing subjective experiences of love?\nSubjective  states  cannot  usually  be  measured  directly.  They  must  be  inferred  from some  agreed-upon  markers.  How  valid  are  the  inferences  in  representing  the  actual phenomenological experience?\nWhen there is a negative finding, that is,  nothing measurable  happens  in  a hypnotic experience  or  in  response  to  a  hypnotic  suggestion,  does  that  mean  the  hypnosis procedure was actually ineffective? Or that the experience of hypnosis wasn't attained by the research subject (or client)?\nThe  research  currently  focuses  on  those  deemed  'high  hypnotizables'  as  a  sensible place  to  look  for  the  markers  of  the  hypnotic  experience.  The  research  on  low  and medium  hypnotizables  is  less  well  developed,  and  it  is  still  a  subject  of  considerable debate as to the actual differences between lows and highs in terms of brain functions.\nThe studies vary substantially not only in the way they define hypnotizability (or is it susceptibility?), but also as to which specific test instruments they employ to differentiate highs from lows.\nThe technology used to assess changes in brain functions in response to hypnosis can only  measure  what  they  can  measure.  As  Dr.  Graham  Jamieson  of  the  Department  of Cognitive  Neuroscience  and  Behavior  of  the  Imperial  College  Faculty  of  Medicine commented to the members of a scientific hypnosis computer listserv (June 12, 2002), '…perhaps  it  is  time  to  move  beyond  course (sic) grained  concepts  such  as  'focused attention' to consider the internally fine grained models now emerging in the cognitiveneurosciences. These models emphasize the rapid reciprocal flow of information between functionally and anatomically distinct subsystems. Traditional measures such as averaging (ERPs) and (frequency) bandpower are poorly suited to tap these relationships.'\nThe  studies  vary  substantially  in  the  way  the  researchers  word  the  suggestions  they offer their research subjects.\nThe brain research on hypnosis is an invaluable source of information about hypnosis and  hypnotic  phenomena.  Such  sophisticated  research  represents  the  crossroad  where subjective  perceptions  intersect  with  their  neuropsychophysiological  correlates.  Future research involving ever more advanced neuroimaging strategies and devices are already on  the  horizon.  Researchers  are  beginning  to  employ  combinations  of  existing  devices (such as fMRI,  or  PET,  or  SPECT  neuroimaging  in  combination  with  EEG  or magnetoencephalography,  known  as  MEG),  and  newer  technologies  such  as  diffuse optical  tomography  (DOT).  (DOT  is  a  noninvasive  optical-imaging  process  involving near-infrared  light  applied  to  tissue  surface  providing  an  absorption  spectrum  for  the tissue. See Diamond, Howe, Boas, Stanley, & Denner, 2002.)",

        "text": "First  and  foremost,  EEG,  MEG,  PET,  SPECT,  fMRI,  and  other  scanning  technologies offer  an  unprecedented  opportunity  to  probe  the  workings  of  the  brain.  Involving hypnosis  in  the  process  as  a  research  variable  can  be  a  valuable  means  of  studying\ncognitive  phenomena  that  can  yield  insights  affecting  the  course  of  treatment  (Raz  & Shapiro, 2002).\nDespite  the  gains  to  be  made  from  brain  research,  however,  there  are  a  number  of issues complicating the treatment process that clinicians should consider. These include: Can we-should we-attempt to define peoples' experiences, especially their problems, in  solely  biological  terms?  As  advocates  of  neurofeedback  suggest,  should  we  define depression,  anxiety,  and  numerous  other  disorders  merely  as  brainwave  dysrhythmias? Similarly, the drug industry has strived to define such disorders as evidence of a neurochemical imbalance requiring medications. However, the evidence is overwhelming that almost every disorder has psychological and social correlates, as well as physical ones. Depression, for example, is about much more than just 'bad chemistry' (Yapko, 2001). Likewise,  the  experience  of  hypnosis  takes  place  in  a  physical  context,  a  social (interpersonal)  context,  and  it  involves  personal  characteristics  such  as  motivation  to attend and expectations. Hypnosis is much more than brainwaves, cerebral blood flow, and  hemispheric  activation.  Despite  this  point,  clinicians  should  be  aware  that  brain physiology  matters,  and  that what  could  be  interpreted as psychologically  based symptoms may well have biological underpinnings. Medical and even neuropsychological evaluations are a sensible first step in treatment.\nDoes  experience  alter  brain  chemistry  and  even  brains  themselves?  Recent  studies suggest the answer is yes. In studies by Dr. Lewis Baxter at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), School of Medicine, depressed patients were exposed to either an SSRI  or  cognitive  behavioral  therapy.  Ten  weeks  later,  both  groups  showed  nearly identical changes in their brains in PET scans. In another study (Brody et al., 2001), also at  UCLA, the results were the same in a 12-week trial of antidepressants compared to interpersonal psychotherapy. In a third study (Martin, Martin, Rai, Richardson, & Royall, 2001)  conducted  in  England,  interpersonal  therapy  compared  to  the  antidepressant Effexor yielded similar results. These studies showed that in response to psychotherapy alone, patients demonstrated decreases in prefrontal cortex activity, increased activity of the  cingulated  gyrus,  and  increased  activity  of  the  caudate  nucleus.  Such  studies  raise more questions than they answer. But, every clinician must consider that in the multiple entry points into the subjective world of the client, each interaction has an effect, as well as potential effects, on multiple levels.\nWhen is hypnosis a treatment tool of choice for someone? Dr. Crawford weighed in on this  issue  when  she  recommended  using  hypnosis  early  on  in  the  treatment  of  pain,  a domain where the biological evidence for a hypnotic effect is substantial (Crawford et al., 1998)  before  the  patient  develops  strong  pain  memories  and  before  surgery  and  long courses  of  drug  treatment  are  initiated.  One  might  offer  similar  criteria  for  someone suffering distress of any sort: Helping the person by using hypnosis before acute distress becomes chronic,  and  (when  appropriate,  of  course)  before  techniques  other  than  selfregulation approaches are employed.\nDoes hypnotizability testing in order to distinguish between high and low hypnotizables bias the clinician's treatment or inform it? There are good arguments for either viewpoint, and these will be explored later. Suffice it to say here that wanting to assess and  enhance  someone's  cognitive  and  behavioral  flexibility is of primary importance  in  doing  treatment,  given  the  implicit  (and  often  explicit)  messages  to  the",

        "text": "One  of  the  questions  I  am  most  frequently  asked  by  others  when  they  discover  my involvement with clinical hypnosis is, 'Can hypnosis be used in the treatment of such and such?' I used to think that I should instantly be able to cite a variety of scientific studies to support my typically affirmative response, but I have changed tactics in recent years. Citing  studies  doesn't  make  the  larger  point  I  think  needs  making  when  someone wonders  aloud  about  the  applications  of  hypnosis.  Now  I  am  much  more  likely  to respond  to  their  question  with  such  counter  questions  as:  Do  you  think  there  is  any mental or emotional involvement with that disorder you are asking about? Do you think someone's attitude, expectations, or belief system plays a role, however major or minor, in his or her experience of the problem? Are someone's feelings, personal needs, or selfimage a factor in the way his or her particular physical and/or mental health problem is experienced?\nIn  asking  people  such  questions,  I  can't  recall  anyone  ever  responding,  'No,  the person's frame of mind is not a factor at all.' I suppose one day I may run into someone who  believes  their  psychological  makeup  has  no  effect  on  their  experience  of  life, including physical symptoms. After I get over the initial shock, I'll try to give that person some insight into ways to use the mind for a level of self-control that might previously have seemed impossible.\nI think the most important philosophical place to begin a study of hypnosis or to start developing  a  realistic  appreciation  for  its  merits  is  with  the  simple  yet  profound recognition that people have more abilities than they tend to realize. Furthermore, it helps in  the  study  of  hypnosis  to  appreciate  the  many  ways  that  the  mind  and  body  are interconnected. I think most people seem to have an intuitive understanding that the mind affects the body, and, likewise, one's physiology affects one's mental experience.\nUnfortunately, while most people can accept this point with relative ease, they often tend to think of this relationship simply as one in which the person's mental makeup can cause him or her to be physically sick, especially as evidenced in the psychophysiological disorders (Gauld, 1992; Hollander, 2001). The relationship between lifestyle and disease is  commonly  acknowledged,  with  stress-related  symptoms  rampant  in  our  society  (D. Brown, 1992; Wickramasekera, 1998). But, if the mind can cause sickness, can't it also foster wellness?  It  is  encouraging  that  many  forms  of  hypnotic  approaches  (e.g., visualization,  guided  imagery,  focusing  techniques)  are  being  used  with  considerable success as adjunct treatments in the intervention of physical disease, usually in behavioral medicine  programs  (Brown  &  Fromm,  1987).  Clinicians  working  in  such  contexts  are usually  wonderfully  aware  that  wellness  is  not  merely  the  absence  of  illness,  and  that hypnosis can play a significant role in absorbing people in healthier lifestyles.\nEssentially,  my  response  to  the  question  of  whether  hypnosis  can  be  used  in  the\ntreatment of some particular disorder promotes the general idea that hypnosis can be used as a tool in the treatment of (not cure of) almost any human condition in which a person's attitude  is  a  factor.  (Pragmatically  speaking,  the  research  evidence,  though  growing exponentially and affirming this point, is much less abundant than the anecdotal evidence from  generations  of  clinicians  applying  hypnosis  with  almost  every  condition  you  can name.)\nThus,  even  if  the  disease  is  an  entirely  organic  one,  such  as  a  physical  injury,  the person's  mental resources  can  still  be  focused  to  help  manage  discomfort  more  easily, and perhaps even to enhance the healing process (Kroger, 1977; Rossi, 2000). In physical disorders where there is no known path to recovery, hypnosis can ease the discomfort, allow  some  rest,  encourage  a  positive  attitude,  and  lessen  any  associated  emotional trauma. Hypnosis may not facilitate a cure for an illness, but it can still help the person on a variety of levels and in meaningful ways (Barretta & Barretta, 2001; Sylvester, 2001).\nA  person's  mental  involvement  in  the  various  psychological  disorders  is  far  more obvious,  and  seems  to  be  the  basis  for  a  more  widespread  acceptance  of  hypnotic principles  and  techniques  among  psychotherapists  compared  to  medical  practitioners. Psychotherapists are generally quite good at incorporating methods for empowering their clients  into  their  therapies.  They  seem  to  more  easily  recognize  hypnosis  can  be  very useful in altering people's self-limiting perceptions (T.Barber, 1985).\nWherever there is involvement of the person's mind in a particular problem, which is everywhere to one degree or another as far as I can tell, there is some potential gain to be made through the application of hypnotic patterns. With that point in mind, this chapter will consider  specific  clinical  contexts  where  hypnosis  may  be  used  to  facilitate therapeutic  outcomes.  But  before  we  consider  clinical  contexts,  let's  first  consider  the most public and therefore visible context in which hypnosis is applied, the stage hypnosis show. I can safely predict, if you develop your skills in hypnosis and start using it in your clinical  practice,  you  will  end  up  having  to  address  clients'  questions  about  the  stage show phenomenon quite frequently, so it will help you to know how these shows operate and how they relate to hypnosis in clinical contexts.",

Such shows are commonly found in nightclubs, at state fairs, parties,  and  in  other  similar  contexts  where  entertainment  is  desired.  I  have  already shared  my  distaste  for  stage  shows  involving  hypnosis,  and  I  have  described  the dynamics of how they work (see chapter 2).\nIn the stage context, hypnosis appears to be a relatively benign method of mind control yet suggests something bordering dangerously close to brainwashing. People in hypnosis are made to look silly (entirely with their permission, of course), and audiences typically have  a  difficult  time  understanding  how  the  entertaining  routines  in  the  show  could possibly  be  used  in  a  professional  context  for  therapeutic  purposes.  Consequently, hypnosis is not considered as a serious treatment alternative, and people are inadvertently robbed of what should be widely considered a valuable treatment option. It is also true",

        "text": "Traditional  medicine  has  long  recognized  the  'placebo  effect.'  In  some  instances,  a patient's positive belief that he or she is getting an active drug when she is really getting no  drug  at  all,  only  a  sugar  pill  resembling  a  drug,  will  generate  the  same  level  of therapeutic effect as if the patient had been given an active drug. Conversely, negative expectations  can  foster  a  'nocebo'  effect,  a  negative  therapeutic  effect.  A  person's expectations and attitudes can obviously have profound effects on mental and physical experience. With this growing recognition of the influence of client expectancy on both physical and psychological treatments, there is a growing use of hypnosis and hypnosisrelated techniques. Psychologist Irving Kirsch, Ph.D., has evolved a specific sociocognitive  model  of  hypnosis,  known  as  the  response  set  theory,  which  heavily emphasizes the role of  expectations  in  treatment  (1985,  2000).  In  fact,  Kirsch  detailed considerable  evidence  that  much  of  the  positive  effect  of  hypnosis  is  due  to  positive expectations on the part of the client, and Kirsch has even come to refer to hypnosis as a 'non-deceptive placebo,' unlike the sugar pills clients are fooled into believing are active drugs (1994). There is a considerable body of empirical evidence attesting to the power of expectations in both psychological and medical conditions (Harrington, 1997).\nGiven  a  foundation  for  appreciating  how  expectancy  can  influence  physiology  and behavioral  responses,  is  hypnosis  only  a  placebo?  Certainly  there  is  some  truth  in  that perspective,  and  if  that's  all  hypnosis  was,  it  would  still  be  worthy  of  intensive  study. After  all,  the  need  to  engage  clients  in  their  treatment  is  vital  to  enhancing  treatment effects and minimizing a sense of victimization and even depression when such reactions delay or even prevent recovery (Lynch, 1999; Yapko, 2001).\nThe quantity of literature describing the applications of hypnosis to medical problems is growing quickly, and empirical evidence for its value is readily available (Montgomery,  DuHamel,  &  Redd,  2000;  Pinnell  &  Covino,  2000).  For  specific applications  you  are  encouraged  to  refer  to  the  various  scientific  hypnosis  journals  in which such research is published. Some of these are mentioned in Appendix A.\nIn general, hypnosis can be a useful adjunct to more traditional medical treatments for several reasons, the first of which relates to the discussion at the beginning of this chapter regarding  the  mind-body  relationship  and  the  role  of  the  mind  (attitudes  and  related emotions) in medical disorders. 'Miracle cures' that defy current medical understanding, which  have  evolved  out  of  a  patient's  refusal  to  give  up,  are  not  uncommon  in  the literature.  Pragmatically  speaking,  why  not  encourage-or  at  least permit 'miracles'? Why place limitations on the patient that he or she would not place on himor herself?\nA second reason for making use of hypnosis in the medical context is because of its emphasis, by its very nature, on the responsibility of each person for his own health and well-being. Use of hypnosis gives people a direct experience of having some control over their internal experiences, whether of pain or distress. I have worked with many people\nwho actually  cried  tears  of  joy  or  relief  in  a  session  for  having  had  an  opportunity  to experience themselves as relaxed, comfortable, and positive when their usual experience of themselves was one of pain and despair. Finding resources of comfort or the ability to shift perceptions of their body within themselves was a dramatic experience, and allowed them to take on a new and higher level of responsibility for themselves and their own well-being.\nSpecific  applications  of  hypnosis  in  medical  contexts  are  greatly  varied,  but  can generally be described as a way of attaining a significant degree of control over physical processes.  One  possibility  is  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  pain  without  the  use  of medication (Chaves, 1993; Montgomery, DuHamel, & Redd, 2000). Pain management is one of the more sophisticated uses of medical hypnosis, and is applicable to the patient in both chronic and acute pain. Pain management techniques can be used before, during, and after surgery, to facilitate easier childbirth, and to help manage physical trauma of any sort. Methods of hypnotic pain management are generally very sophisticated, and you are advised to have a very strong background of education and experience in hypnosis before working  with  individuals  in  pain.  Working  with  people  in  physical  pain  presupposes appropriate medical licensure or appropriate medical supervision in all cases.\nHypnosis  is  commonly  used  in  the  treatment  of  anxiety  and  stress  disorders,  and  is considered to be a most effective treatment (Schoenberger, 2000). Teaching the medical patient  techniques  for  preventing  negative  stress  wherever  possible,  techniques  for identifying  stress  well  before  it  reaches  a  level  where  it  is  likely  to  cause  debilitating symptoms, and techniques for relaxing and managing stress positively are all elements in teaching a hypertensive patient to manage his or her condition positively and responsibly.\nHypnosis  in  the  treatment  of  serious  diseases,  as  an  adjunct,  not  a  replacement,  for more traditional approaches, has demonstrated the necessity of addressing the emotional needs while using the mental resources of the patient as a part of treatment. This is true even  for  diseases  that  seem,  and  probably  are,  entirely  organic  in  nature.  The  exact mechanism whereby a doctor can mumble a few hypnotic phrases and effect changes in the  patient  is unknown.  In  general,  hypnosis  is  thought  to  strengthen  the  body's immunological functions and assist in fighting disease. How it does this exactly has been the focus of a relatively new  field called psychoneuro-immunology  (Kalt,  2000; Kropiunigg,  1993).  Much  research  still  needs  to  be  done,  of  course,  but  the  lack  of precise  explanations for mechanisms of action should not inhibit the use of techniques that can  assist in the healing  of  a  human  body.  Hypnosis  doesn't  replace  other treatments-it adds to them.\nThere are a couple of special issues associated with hypnosis and mind-body healing approaches that I'd like to draw to your attention. The first concerns the responsibility of a patient for his or her health. The goal is to positively encourage a person to use all of his or her resources to help him-or herself. Pointing out responsibility for one's self is not meant  to  translate  into  blaming  the  person  for  his  or  her  condition. One  of  the  most distressing (to me, at least) things to arise from the recognition of patient responsibility is when the doctor, or other well-meaning health professional, further burdens the suffering patient with blame for having caused his or her illness. It's not bad enough the person is sick, he or she is also told he or she caused it ('You're ill because you have unresolved feelings of anger toward your mother'), and is even asked why he or she did this to him-\nor  herself!  ('Do  you  have  an  unconscious  need  to  suffer?')  No,  this  is  not  the  intent; personal responsibility in health care is positive, blame is not. Helping the person to feel guilty about having made him- or herself sick is a poor outcome of a careless interaction.\nThe second issue, mentioned in passing earlier, relates to the use of hypnosis in the treatment  of  medical  problems.  Specifically,  unless  you  are  a  physician,  or  have  the proper training and credentials to treat a person's physical disorders, you are working out of your field and are inviting trouble for both you and your patient. If you want to assist someone in the treatment of a physical disorder, it is imperative from an ethical, legal, and  humane  standpoint  that  you  have  the  support  and  involvement  of  the  appropriate medical  practitioners.  You  cannot  simply  assume,  for  example,  that  a  patient  with migraines is 'just stressed.' With that symptom, and all others, the patient should have a thorough  physical  examination,  and  you  should  have  medical  backup  as  you  treat individuals  with what may well turn out to be organically induced symptoms. Call the patient's doctor directly, and ask if your treatment plan will interfere with his or hers, at the very least. Rarely, if ever, will it interfere and treatment can be coordinated between you. Knowledge of medications the patient may be taking and the physical impact of his or her symptoms is also essential to effective suggestion formulation.\nThe growing use of hypnosis in a broad range of medical conditions is evidence of the influence of all those who have called for a more person-centered practice of medicine. Physicians,  to  their  credit,  have  generally  evolved  a  style  of  practice  that  invites  the patient  to  be  an  informed  and  active  participant  in  treatment.  Hypnosis  amplifies  this partnership and thereby empowers patients to mobilize their own resources to supplement whatever other treatments they might also be receiving.",

        "text": "The powerful mind-body relationship evidenced in medical applications of hypnosis is also  evident  in  dental  applications.  Many  of  the  desired  outcomes  sought  in  medical contexts are also desirable in the dental setting because of the physical nature of dental work. Physical parts of the body (i.e., teeth, gums, and associated structures) are under treatment. Furthermore, attached to every mouth under treatment is a human being whose attitudes  about  the  work  being  done,  the  dentist,  and  his  or  her  self  (self-image)  will affect the outcome of the intervention.\nDentists  are  aware,  perhaps  acutely,  that  most  dental  patients  do  not  mark  their calendar months in advance of their appointment and wait with eager anticipation for the big  day  to  arrive.  Far  more  common  is  the  patient  coming  for  treatment  who  can  be described as somewhere in between mildly reluctant and terrified.\nHypnosis as a means of effectively communicating with and enhancing the treatments of  the  dental  patient  has  been  well  documented.  Helping  a  patient  reduce  his  or  her anxiety about receiving dental treatment with a few well-chosen statements can make a huge difference in the outcome. In one case, a dental phobia was successfully treated by suggesting  to  the  patient  that  a  previous  negative  experience  with  dentistry  could  be altered  and  remembered  as  having  been  a  positive  experience  (Baker  &  Boas,  1983). Finkelstein  (1991)  also  described  ways  hypnosis  could  be  used  to  reduce  anxiety  in\nfearful patients. Clearly, one good dental experience-real or imagined-can skillfully be used as a prototype for future dental experiences. The person may not eagerly await the next appointment, but he or she won't have to live in dread, either.\nA  second  good  use  of  hypnosis  in  dentistry  involves  the  use  of  pain  management techniques.  Many  people  either  cannot  or  choose  not  to  use  chemical  anesthesias  (or analgesias) such as novocaine or nitrous oxide, and prefer to rely on their own resources when undergoing  dental  treatment.  Hypnosis  techniques  for  creating  the  experience  of analgesia or  anesthesia  allow  the  patient  to  reduce  to  a  more  easily  managed  level  the degree  of  discomfort  experienced,  and  many  are  able  to  eliminate  the  discomfort altogether (J.Barber, 1977; Chaves, 1993).\nA third use of hypnosis in dentistry is for its ability to assist in directing the flow of blood. With proper techniques, ones that really fit well with the patient's experience of himself,  hypnosis  can  reduce  blood  flow  to  the  area  under  treatment  (Holroyd,  1992; Newman,  1971).  The  result  is  a  less  traumatic  experience  for  the  patient  and  greater clarity for the dentist in seeing what he or she is doing. A related use of hypnosis is for the enhancement of the healing process following treatment. Use of hypnosis techniques involving  the  imagining  of  healing  (e.g.,  images,  feelings,  and  sounds  associated  with rebuilding, repairing, and strengthening) can both shorten the recovery period and allow greater comfort during that time.\nAnother use of hypnosis in dentistry has been to counter bruxism, or teeth grinding. In one study by Clarke and Reynolds (1991), bruxism patients were given suggestions to develop a greater awareness of and control over the muscles in their jaws. The results were quite impressive, as both bruxism and reports of pain were significantly reduced.\nFinally,  hypnosis  to  encourage  better  dental  health  practices  has  been  successfully employed (Kelly,  McKinty,  &  Carr,  1988).  Suggestions  to  increase  time  brushing  and flossing can be given to encourage prevention of dental problems.\nMany dental practices could easily incorporate hypnosis into treatment through the use of generalized relaxation tapes the patient can listen to (through headphones) during the dental procedures. Of course, better responses occur with more individualized approaches,  but  unusual  is  the  dentist  who  has  the  time,  interest,  and  means  for  the greater involvement in hypnosis such a practice would require.",

        "text": "In decades past, hypnosis had frequently been used in the course of criminal investigations  to  refresh  or  enhance  eyewitness  testimony,  whether  that  of  a  witness, victim,  or  suspect  (Sheehan  &  McConkey, 1993). In light of the considerable research evidence that hypnosis was given more credibility in the domain of memory enhancement than it deserved, a subject I'll explore in depth later, hypnosis has lost much of its value as an investigative tool.\nAs a part of the investigative process, particularly when information simply can't be obtained  in  any  other  way,  hypnosis  may  be  used  to  facilitate  a  person's  recall  in  an attempt to recover details of the crime the person could not consciously remember. Often, a person's conscious mind is so absorbed in feelings (e.g., fear, fascination, confusion)\nduring  the  experience  of  witnessing  or  being  victimized  by  a  crime  that  conscious memory  is  poor  (Udolf,  1983).  Because  of  the  dual  nature  of  the  human  mind  (i.e., conscious and unconscious), memories and details that may have been repressed or else simply  escaped  conscious  detection  may  not  have  escaped  the  person's  unconscious (Scheflin & Shapiro, 1989; Kroger, 1977).\nA number of famous, or perhaps infamous, criminal cases have been solved through hypnotically  obtained  information,  one  such  case  being  the  'Chowchilla  Kidnapping' case in which a school bus driver and his bus full of students were kidnapped in the small town of Chowchilla in northern California. Three men commandeered the bus to a nearby rock quarry where it and the people inside were buried, and then they issued a ransom demand.  The  bus  driver  managed  to  escape,  and  the  children  were  soon  rescued.  Dr. William Kroger, a pioneer and long-time contributor to the field of hypnosis, was called in to use hypnosis with the driver, who was then able to recall the license plate number (though  numbers  were  reversed)  of  one  of  the  kidnappers'  vans.  This  hypnotically obtained information helped lead to their arrest and subsequent conviction for the crime. (Continued on page 113.)",

        "text": "William S.Kroger, M.D. (1906-1995), was one of the primary early catalysts driving the development of the field of clinical hypnosis. Dr. Kroger became fascinated with hypnosis at an early age, and his interest endured throughout his  long,  distinguished  career.  He  was  inspired  to  be  a  physician  out  of compassion for people's suffering, and  early professional  influences  on  him nudged  him  in  the  direction  of  psychosomatic  medicine.  Dr.  Kroger  cofounded  the  Society  for  Clinical  and  Experimental  Hypnosis,  and  together with  Dr.  Milton  Erickson,  co-founded  the  American  Society  of  Clinical Hypnosis. He also organized the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. Not only  did  Dr.  Kroger  write  the  book  that  was  long  considered the book  on hypnosis, Clinical  and  Experimental  Hypnosis  in  Medicine,  Dentistry  and Psychology (2nd  ed.,  1977),  but  he  authored  and  co-authored  many  other important works, including his 1976  book  with  William  Fezler called Hypnosis  and  Behavior  Modification:  Imagery  Conditioning . Dr.  Kroger's deep interest in ways the mind can influence physical responses in particular led  him  to  apply  hypnosis  in  a  wide  variety  of  ways,  but  especially  in  pain relief.\nDr. Kroger's precedent setting demonstrations more than half a century ago of surgical  procedures  done  under  hypnosis  remain  landmark  events  in propelling the young and questionable field of hypnosis onto its current level of  acceptability  and  interest.  His  commitment  as  a  clinician  and  teacher inspired many of the most prominent people in the field to help bring hypnosis into  mainstream  research  and  practice.  Anyone  who  professionally  practices hypnosis owes a great deal to Dr. Kroger, whose pioneering efforts paved the\nway for the field to grow to its current proportions.\nO n  the  Origin  of  His  Interest  in  Hypnosis: 'My  interest  in  hypnosis started  in  1919.  My  father  had  a  fur  store  in  Evanston,  Illinois.  In  order  to stimulate business, he hired a professional hypnotist to hypnotize a woman as a publicity stunt in order to create interest in the Main Street Businessmen's Association.  This,  I  can  see  as  if  it  was  yesterday.  The  girl's  name  was Florina, and she was dressed in purple flowing gowns and veils. And he, with the piercing eyes, approached her and said, 'Florina, sleep!' He stared in her eyes and she fell backwards and they put her in a coffin and buried her in the ground. I was a curious little cuss, and so I went by and paid a nickel to see this sleeping beauty in the ground. She lay there in a vault for two days, and I thought, 'Gee, that's fantastic!' On the third day, they dug her up. 'Florina, wake up!' She opened her eyes, she blinked,\nshe stood up-it was the same thing you'd see on the stage today. So I went around to the kids in the neighborhood and I looked into their eyes and said, 'Sleep!' And to my amazement, half of them fell over. I did the usual things; like I could put pins in their arms, and I'd say, 'Jeez, I could be a doctor some day. This would be great for anesthesia.' So, I didn't realize that hypnosis was anything  more  than  a  stage  tool  until  I  got  to  Northwestern  University.  At Northwestern  University,  I  met  the  late  Dr.  J.D.  Morgan,  whose  book  you may be familiar with on  abnormal  psychology.  We  had  several  lectures  on hypnosis, and I said, 'My God, this is a scientific tool!''\nO n Early Prejudices Against Hypnosis: 'I was the only doctor who was using hypnosis in the Chicago area. I was laughed at, ridiculed, vilified, and abused,  and  made  to  walk  seven  steps  behind  everybody  else  like  I  was  a leper.  I  was  persecuted  by  the  Illinois  State  Medical  Society  for  an  exhibit. They were just against hypnosis, [even just] the word…\n'The difficulties I went through…. You don't know how difficult it really was!  [For  the  first  movie  ever  showing  thyroid  surgery  done  with  only hypnotic anesthesia]…it was an historic moment. First one in the world, and we pulled it off! [The medical director] was sitting downstairs in his office, getting a 'blow-by-blow' description of how the surgery was going, hoping it was going to fail [because hypnosis was involved].\n'Individuals who have never gone through things like that can't understand it.  See, today hypnosis has some respectability, but in those days, they said, 'Walk seven steps behind me, you're a leper!' They didn't want to associate with me; they said, 'You're a hypnotist.''\nO n 'Trance' and Hypnosis: 'Most people refer to it as a 'trance.' It's not a  'trance.'  To  me,  that  term  is  like  fingernails  scratching  on  a  chalkboard. That's  the  most  ridiculous  term  for  it.  [Hypnosis]  is  a  state  of  increased awareness. If you're more aware, whatever you hear is going to sink in better. If it sinks in better, you get a better response, whether it's hitting a golf ball or\nhaving an erection. As Bernheim said, 'There is no hypnosis, only suggestion.'  That's  how  I  conceptualize  it.  I  conceptualize  it  in  terms  of neural science concepts as a method of transmitting a message in a minimal noise  environment.  If  the  signal  to  noise  ratio  is  reduced,  the  message  is clearly  received.  'No  other  living  system  can  do  [what  humans  can].  Ideas have representations and names. You can't say to a dog, 'Go to the toilet' He doesn't  understand  'toilet.'  But  a  human  can-and  that  makes  humans unique, because they can manipulate symbolic communication. The cortex is uniquely different in a human than in any other living system. And it's that cortex that you get out of the way (in terms of its criticalness) that allows you to induce a feeling of belief.\nSo,  what  is  hypnosis?  It's  the  induction  of  conviction.  All  these  guys  talk about 'hypnosis is this and that'-it's a very simple thing that's [been made] complex, enormously complex.'\nO n Inductions and Beliefs: 'Now, an induction technique is an interesting study on feedback control. I'd say, 'You are looking into my eyes, your eyes are  getting  heavy.'  They're  not  getting  heavy  because  of  what  I'm  saying. They're getting heavy because of the fact that he is gazing up at the ceiling. But the subject imputes to you a magical omnipotence, and he says, 'My God, my eyes did get heavy! This guy's got power!' If he accepts A, B, C, and D suggestions, then he'll accept X, Y, and Z ones. All the time you say, 'You are a good hypnotic subject and yes, that's why that happened.' And all the time, it had nothing to do with what the operator was saying, it had more to do with restructuring his beliefs.'\nO n Cybernetics and Hypnosis: 'I'm going to continue to emphasize the cybernetic principles of feedback systems relative to theories of hypnosis, as well  as  some  of  the  very  important  neuropsychophysiological  aspects  by making the computer analogies. The brain functions like a computer. I'm not saying  the  brain  is  a  computer-I'm  only  saying  I  think  we  can  better understand the brain's chemical qualities and neurophysiological mechanisms in terms of cybernetic principles and feedback mechanisms.'\nSource: Personal communication, 1987\nThe use of hypnotically obtained testimony in the courtroom is embroiled in controversy even now. Experts are at odds over the issue of whether hypnotically obtained testimony is  valid  because  of  the  potentially  detrimental  effects  of  hypnosis  on  memory  (e.g., intentionally or unintentionally suggested misrememberings). On one side of the issue are those who claim that the information obtained from a hypnotized person is as usable and reliable  as  any  other  information  obtained  from  memory,  and  that  hypnosis  does  not necessarily distort  memory.  On  the  other  side  of  the  issue  are  those  who  claim  that hypnosis invariably alters memory, that the hypnotized witness can lie while in hypnosis, and  is  likely  to  fill  in  missing  details  either  with  fantasy  material  or  with  information\ncontained in the subtle leading questions of the investigator. San Francisco attorney and hypnosis expert Alan Scheflin, J.D., has been integral to the field in sorting out the legal implications  of  the  use  of  hypnosis  in  clinical  as  well  as  forensic  contexts  (Scheflin, 1995, 2001).\nThe issue is really one concerning the nature of memory. In a sense, both views on hypnosis  and  memory  are  correct.  The  conflict  is  a  pseudo-conflict,  a  conflict  arising because of its 'either-or' nature, which is not a useful dichotomy in this case. All human memory is a distortion of experience-a memory is an internal representation of an event and not the event itself. The process of experiencing and then remembering is regulated by many factors, including values regarding what is important to notice; mood; internal or external focus; expectations; previous experiences in similar situations; and a variety of other factors that must be considered.\nMemory,  whether  in  a  formally  induced  hypnotic  condition  or  in  the  less  specific condition called 'life,' can be reliable to a large extent, such as in 'objective' experience when many people reach agreement on the object of observation. Likewise, memory in or out  of  hypnosis  can  distort  experience  because  of  all  the  factors  described  earlier  that comprise one's conscious and unconscious information-processing capacities. Why else can ten  people  (presumably  not all  in  hypnosis)  standing  on  a  street  corner  all  see  the same accident yet their police reports offer ten different versions?\nHypnotically obtained information should be considered in the same way  as information obtained by any other means, in my view. It should be considered, evaluated, and substantiated by other means. If one has a motivation to lie, though, hypnosis has no preventative  powers.  If  one  must  distort  or  misrepresent  an  experience,  it  won't  be because of hypnosis. One doesn't require formal hypnosis to fill in gaps or rely on others' leads;  these  processes  are  ongoing  in  all  human  beings.  I  fully  agree  with  Australian memory and hypnosis researchers  Peter  Sheehan  (1995)  and  Kevin  McConkey  (1992) that blaming hypnosis for the memory distortions is not reasonable when the evidence is clear that memory distortion is not unique to hypnosis.\nThe other potential use of hypnosis in the forensic context is to help alleviate the stress and distress in having witnessed or been victimized by a crime. A skillful practitioner can help  lessen  the  trauma  by  easing  the  person  into  a  different  frame  of  mind,  either  by helping  the  person  shift  his  or  her  focus  away  from  what  has  happened  to  another experience,  or  by  helping  the  person  shift  from  one  uncomfortable  dimension  of  the experience to another that is relatively neutral (neutral at least, but positive if possible). The  things  one  concludes  and  the  things  one  says  to  one's  self  after  a  traumatic experience play a huge role in the rate and degree of recovery.\nSpecial consideration for the emotional state of the person who recalls details of the trauma  must  be  an  integral  part  of  the  use  of  hypnosis  in  the  forensic  sciences. Mechanisms to assure the emotional security and wellbeing of the person must be part of the process, for being left alone to carry the hurt of memories brought out hypnotically is otherwise one more trauma for an already vulnerable human being (Spiegel, 1993).",

        "text": "Teaching  and  learning  are  highly  refined  skills  which  require  a  great  amount  of information processing on multiple levels. Teaching is a learning experience-learning how  to  capture  students'  interest  and  attention  (a  skill  necessary  for  induction  of hypnosis, not coincidentally), learning how to present information in such a way that the student can use it (a skill necessary for utilization of hypnosis, not coincidentally), and learning how to allow students to become self-sufficient learners (a skill necessary  for consolidating  treatment  results  with  hypnosis,  not  coincidentally)  so  they  may  be competent  and  motivated  to  learn  in  the  absence  of  the  teacher.  Whether  a  teacher  is teaching  preschoolers  or  doctoral  candidates,  effective  teaching  involves  these  steps paralleling hypnotic patterns.\nLearning  is  a  multiple  step  process.  For  the  sake  of  simplicity  (learning  theory  is  a complex  world  in  its  own  right),  effective  learning  must  include  the  following  basic steps:  First,  there  must  be  some  degree  of  attentiveness  to  the  material  to  be  learned. Second, there must be some method for bringing the material from the outside world into the  internal  world.  One's  senses  (e.g.,  sight,  hearing,  etc.)  are  the  means  for  gathering information  from  the  world  around  us.  There  is  nothing  we  experience  of  the  external world that does not enter our conscious or unconscious mind through one or more of our senses. Which sense is the dominant one at a given time determines, to a large degree, how much and what kind of information can be acquired (Lankton, 1979). For example, a high  level  of  awareness  for  your  (internal)  feelings  while  trying  to  memorize  a  set  of graphs or charts  (external  visual  information)  is  likely  to  result  in  ineffective  learning. Third, there must be some method for organizing the information internally as it mingles with  previously  acquired  information  while  simultaneously  building  a  framework  in which to incorporate future learnings. Fourth, and last, there must be some method for being able to retrieve the information from within as necessity dictates.\nDoes  hypnosis  enhance  learning  by  enhancing  memory?  As  you  learned  in  the previous section, hypnosis does not seem to do much for enhancing accurate memory. Studies on using hypnosis to increase recall of meaningful as well as nonsense material generally reinforce this point (Dywan, 1988; Holroyd, 1992).\nHypnosis  as  a  tool  has  been  used  successfully,  however,  to  assist  in  the  learning process both by enhancing concentration and diminishing anxiety. Anxiety can interrupt any  of  the  above  steps  (e.g.,  'going  blank  at  exam  time')  and  poor  concentration  can distract  one  from  adequate  exposure  to  the  information  as  well  as  disrupt  its  internal organization (Stanton, 1993).\nMany creative teachers at all levels are using hypnosis in their teach-ing, encouraging students' creativity and guiding students with relaxation procedures, for example (Wark, 1996;  Wolf,  1986). Many  students  are developing  themselves  with  self-hypnosis exercises,  learning  to  manage  anxiety  and  increase  their  ability  to  notice  and  organize their subject of study. Hypnosis  in  the  educational  context,  whether  formally  or informally  used, can  enhance  teaching  skills, creativity, and  student  performance (Shames & Bowers, 1992).",

Communication  that  influences  is  a  vital  component  of  any  comprehensive  view  of hypnosis;  in  the  business  context  the  principles  of  effective  communication  can  either make  or  break  a  company.  Discussing  specific  skills  in  suggestion  formation  is  the subject of later chapters; suffice it to say here that for the businessperson who is able to communicate his or her ideas in flexible ways to those he or she interacts with, there is a greater likelihood of success at all levels. Communication skills in such interactions as the  presentation  of  a  marketing  plan,  the  handling  of  a  troublesome  employee  or supervisor,  the  job  interview,  performance  evaluations,  job  standard  clarification,  the creation of a desirable work atmosphere, and the many other dimensions of the business world  are  all  ultimately  interpersonal  interactions  where  skilled  communication  and influence can occur.\nIn  the  business  consultations  I  occasionally  do,  identifying  rigid  and  dysfunctional communication patterns and replacing them with more flexible approaches helps enhance the business on multiple levels.

        "text": "Engaging in athletics with any degree of intensity involves a large measure of physical control and mental concentration. Hypnosis as a tool can provide both with extraordinary efficiency.  For  the  athlete,  having  precise  control  over  one's  body  is  essential  to outstanding performance. Athletes often describe what they call 'muscle memory,' the body's  keen  awareness  of  how  each  limb,  each  muscle  must  be  positioned  in  order  to perform successfully.  The  physical  control  through  the  amplification  of  the  mind-body relationship  can  help  an  athlete  push  his  or  her  body  to  the  upper  limit  of  his  or  her talents. The  requirement  for  intense  concentration  is  obvious,  and  hyp-nosis  as  a technique for narrowing one's attentional focus to the task at hand is a powerful tool to have available (Liggett, 2000; Morgan, 1993).\nIn addition to building concentration and physical control, hypnosis can help in better managing the tension inherent in competing. Furthermore, building positive expectations and positive communication with one's self through self-hypnosis can enhance performance  dramatically.  Often,  the  troubled,  slumping  athlete  has  mental  images  of failure,  which  all  too  easily  get  translated  into  real  failure.  Building  positive  images through hypnosis and self-hypnosis can turn an athlete's performance around completely. Certainly,  hypnosis  does  not  provide  extra  talent  to  the  athlete;  it  simply  amplifies  the talent the athlete has, giving greater access to as much of his or her talent as possible. A lot of athletes appreciate that, as you can well imagine.",

        "text": "Being  a  psychotherapist  by  training  and  in  practice,  I  have  developed  a  profound appreciation for the possibilities hypnosis has to offer in the treatment of behavioral and emotional problems. Hypnosis as a part of therapist training programs seems an essential need, yet only a handful of formal programs offer the opportunity to develop expertise in hypnotic  skills.  Most  people  who  become  knowledgeable  in  hypnosis  do  so  through involvement  with  workshops  and  seminars  organized  by  private  practitioners  and professional hypnosis societies.\nThe interesting thing about the omission of direct hypnosis training courses in many schools is that they are teaching aspects of hypnosis indirectly anyway.  Every psychotherapy involves  influencing  a  troubled  person  in  some  way  so  the  person  may feel  better.  There  are  countless  approaches  for  helping  others  to  grow,  adapt  more successfully to the demands of life, or carry out whatever you think therapy should assist people to do. Each of them can show positive results, too (Hubble, Duncan, & Miller, 1999). What are the elements of each approach that influence the person seeking help to change? Whatever model for conceptualizing the human condition you might work from, clearly you are attempting to influence another human being's experience in a way that is beneficial. The way you do this, regardless of what you say or do (which is the difference in content from approach to approach), is through communication.\nHow do you know where to step in and offer help in a client's world? Only from the way the client communicates about his or her world can you come to know enough of it to  discover  where  and  how  much  to  intervene.  Only  through  the  way  you  speak (including what you say and what you don't say) and move can you effect a change in another  human  being.  The  client  seeking  psychotherapy  cannot not respond  to  your communications; the sophistication of a good therapist is getting the desired, therapeutic response.\nWhatever therapies a clinical training program offers will indirectly include hypnosis because  every  therapy  includes  hypnosis  (T.Barber,  1985).  Even  the  classic  hypnotic phenomena  (such  as  age  regression  and  dissociation)  described  in  later  chapters  are evident in every therapy, but the concepts and uses for those phenomena are typically not taught. Why? Simply because these phenomena have other names and characterizations in other models of psychotherapy. For example, the father of modern cognitive therapy, psychiatrist Aaron Beck, M.D., claimed he does not do hypnosis (personal communication,  December,  1990).  But,  he  has  no  hesitations  about  encouraging  his clients to close their eyes, relax, and focus on imagining themselves successfully carrying out some new behavior they're learning. He calls this a 'success imagery.' Structurally, however, he is doing an induction of focusing suggestions, he is orienting the person to the  future,  he  is  associating  the  person  to  new  behaviors  or  thought  patterns  in  some familiar context, and he is fostering a dissociation from old ineffective patterns. That is hypnosis! (For  a  detailed  discussion  of  how  hypnosis  is  evident  in  other  therapies, especially cognitive therapy, see Yapko, 1992).\nA willingness to develop many therapy skills based on a variety of perspectives assures a  greater  likelihood  of  success.  All  of  the  various  therapeutic  approaches  work  in  a\ngeneral sense (Miller, Duncan, & Hubble, 1997). The skill is in knowing what will work with this specific person.\nWhy use hypnosis to effect a dissociation and then look to unconscious resources for trying to help the client? It is a different way of doing therapy. But, the person seeking help  has  quite  likely already  tried  to consciously  change  (perhaps  through  sheer willpower  or  by  seeking  greater  self-understanding  from  reading  self-help  books)  and failed to do so. The resources the person can get to consciously aren't the ones that have solved matters. In simpler terms, the perceptual frame the person has used to solve the problem hasn't been helpful; the solutions are more likely to be outside the person's usual experience  of him-  or herself. Hypnosis  helps  people  'step  outside' their usual experience  of  themselves,  allowing  new  associations  to  be  formed  in  their  inner  lives (whether on cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and/or physical levels). Hypnosis by itself cures nothing. It's what happens during the hypnosis that has the potential to be helpful to people.\nHypnosis in psychotherapy can be used in at least  two general ways:  (1) to suggest symptom relief;  and,  (2)  to  teach  specific  skills  (e.g.,  cognitive,  behavioral,  relational) that can help someone better cope with and resolve ongoing issues and problems as well as deal with their presenting symptoms. How someone uses hypnosis clinically is a direct reflection of his or her own beliefs about what constitutes appropriate clinical practice.\nHypnosis  that  involves  simply  performing  an  induction  procedure  and  then  giving suggestions  for  symptom  relief  is  the  most  superficial  and  least  sophisticated  use  of hypnosis. (And, amazingly, it still helps a lot of people!) Telling someone in hypnosis that  his  or  her  anxiety  will  diminish  a  little  each  day  so  that  by  next  week  'you'll  be fine,' or telling someone who wants to feel better about him- or herself the old hypnotic suggestion, 'Everyday in every way you are getting better and better,' is an insult to the intelligence of a client, not to mention a bore to the clinician. This kind of hypnosis is used on a purely symptomatic basis, and is the kind of hypnosis almost all lay hypnotists practice and even many trained psychotherapists use. It can and will be effective with a certain percentage of people; of course, there are some people who will change when you look at them harshly and say in a stern voice, 'Stop doing that!' simply because they are ready to change. Since a symptomatic approach can and does work with many people, it is  a  viable  choice  to  use  in  some therapies.  Be aware, though, that this is only a small fraction of the usefulness of hypnosis.\nMore  complex  and  skilled  applications  of  hypnosis  involve  the  use  of  techniques aimed at resolution of deeper conflicts (resolving the symptoms as well) and teaching key skills  that  can  be  helpful  in  resolving  current  concerns  and  preventing  future  ones,  if possible. This kind of clinical hypnosis involves more of an interactional approach and works more comprehensively on multiple dimensions of the individual. What that means exactly  will  become  clear  to  you  in  later  chapters  when  you  learn  about  structuring therapies using hypnosis.\nHow  you  ultimately  incorporate  hypnosis  into  your  practice  is  determined  by  the assumptions you make about people (Ritterman, 2001). A view of people that appreciates each person's uniqueness would preclude you from approaching each client in the same way. To diagnose and categorize, and then treat the category rather than the person in a 'cookbook' manner is undesirable, in my view. Likewise, a view of people that assumes\nall people seeking help are 'sick' and need to be made 'well' would preclude you from making use of the wealth of their personal resources that would be available to another clinician who views people as uniquely special and potentially powerful in their ability to make use of their resources for growth.\nUse of hypnosis in the context of psychotherapy is a potent means for facilitating the client's  movement  toward  a  more  empowered  and  satisfying  existence.  Practice  with hypnotic  techniques  will  demonstrate  to  you  repeatedly  the  diversity,  creativity,  and power of people. That is one last great reason for its use; you will grow a lot, too!\nIn whatever context you choose to apply hypnosis, you cannot help but notice that the increased  flexibility  and  sensitivity  you  demonstrate  toward  others  will  receive  an appreciative response.",

        "text": "We live in a social world, a world populated with other people who have the potential to exert influence on us merely through the things they say and do, even if those things are not  directed  at  us  specifically.  Haven't  you  been  influenced  by  a  movie  you  saw  or  a lecture you attended, nonspecific as it might have been to you as an anonymous member of the audience? Realistically, how can we not be influenced by others (Aronson, 1999)?\nThe  responsiveness  to  suggestions,  that  is,  direct  and  indirect  messages  imparting information and perspective, and the associated vulnerability to the influence of others (and  to  our  self-suggestions  as  well)  is  the  essence  of  human  suggestibility.  John Kihlstrom, Ph.D., is a prominent psychologist and hypnosis researcher at the University of  California,  Berkeley.  An  influential  advocate  for  a  cognitive-dissociative  view  of hypnosis,  Kihlstrom  defined  hypnosis  this  way:  'Hypnosis  may  be  defined  as  a  social interaction in which one person, designated the subject, responds to suggestions offered by  another  person,  designated  the  hypnotist,  for  experiences  involving  alterations  in perceptions, memory and voluntary action' (1985, p. 385). His definition of hypnosis is a general one that involves clear role definitions existing within a social framework from which the various alterations (i.e., hypnotic phenomena) and cognitive shifts are derived.\nKihlstrom's definition does not suggest a separate and discrete state of hypnosis, but rather a hypnosis that can be viewed within the larger context of social influence. Socialpsychological  theorists  of  hypnosis  do  not  typically  think  of  hypnosis  as  a  state  of experience that is distinct in its own right. Rather, they think of hypnosis as something better explained in terms of social principles of behavior that are found in many contexts, not  just  the  hypnotic  one  (T.Barber,  1969,  2000;  Spanos,  1991;  Spanos  &  Coe,  1992; Wagstaff, 1991).\nIs hypnosis the same as suggestibility? Can we accurately say that hypnosis increases suggestibility, and the evidence for hypnosis is an increase in suggestibility? The circular relationship between the phenomena of hypnosis and suggestibility is both apparent and confusing: Hypnosis occurs because people are suggestible, and people are suggestible because they're in hypnosis.\nThe  relationship  between  suggestibility  and  the  clinical  benefits  to  be  derived  from hypnosis  is  an  important  domain  of  inquiry.  Is  suggestibility  simply  an  individual personality trait that exists in stable form across different contexts? Or is it determined by additional  factors  beyond  the  person's  capacity  to  respond  to  suggestion,  such  as  the salience of a suggestion or the demeanor of the person who offers it?\nMy response to these important questions is both: Suggestibility in a general sense is a relatively  stable  quality  of  response  over  time  (Piccione,  Hilgard,  &  Zimbardo,  1989). And, in a particular context, such as a clinical interaction, suggestibility is mediated by a variety of personal, social, and situational factors that can serve to increase or decrease it\nin someone (T. Barber, 2000). The phenomenon of suggestibility will be explored in this chapter.",

        "text": "Some clinicians are of the belief they can do therapy or do hypnosis without influencing the  dynamics  of  the  process.  For  example,  they  think  they  can  hypnotically  'dig'  for memories  without  influencing the types of memories  that emerge  (Calof, 1993; Fredrickson, 1992), or they think they can be therapeutically neutral by refusing either to take sides with a family member or to offer a client direct advice (Rogers, 1986; Sanford, 1987). It is an illusion to believe you can be in a therapy relationship with someone yet not play a direct role in what happens in that relationship.\nHypnosis  in  the  clinical  context  is  invariably  a  directive  approach,  meaning  it  is purposefully  applied  with  a  therapeutic  goal  in  mind.  Influence  is  an  overt  goal,  not  a hidden agenda, which some clinicians may have difficulty with if they are of the belief that influencing clients is somehow either wrong or undesirable. To believe you can do therapy or hypnosis with a client-by definition an interpersonal process-yet only elicit the  client's  intrapersonal  dynamics  ignores  the  roles  of  the  clinician  and  the  social context in the process.\nSimilarly, as the trend continues in the field of psychotherapy to empirically validate treatments and even manualize them, the illusion persists that therapeutic effectiveness is entirely in the technique and not the relationship that provides the context for making the technique viable (Hubble, Duncan, & Miller, 1999). When more than one person is in the room, social influence is inevitable.\nThe  field  of  social  psychology  in  particular  offers  many  valuable  insights  into  the dynamics of interpersonal influence that are immediately relevant to the clinical context in general and to the use of hypnosis in particular. Social psychology as a field evolved out of the recognition that people will do things when they are alone that they will not do if  even  just  one  other  person  is  around  (Aronson,  1999).  An  individual's  behavior changes in the presence of another individual, often in systematic and predictable ways. Social  psychology's  task  as  a  field  is  to  identify  what  kinds  of  interactions  between people  are  likely  to  cause  specific  types  of  behavior,  and  has  as  its  ultimate  (and idealistic) goal the establishment of organizations and environments that will maximize positive  behaviors  in  individuals  (Bordens  &  Horowitz,  2002).  Interpersonal  influence has  been  studied  in  a  variety  of  ways  and  contexts  by  social  psychologists,  yielding  a substantial amount of information that is extremely valuable in describing many of the dimensions of the hypnotic relationship. Some of these are conscious, while many others are unconscious factors in the relationship. Knowledge of these factors may allow you a greater  recognition  of  them  when  they  arise  in  treatment,  and  a  greater  flexibility  in deliberately applying them. Let's take a look at social influence in specific contexts.",

        "text": "In  America,  many  billions  of  dollars  are  spent  yearly  on  advertising  products  and services. Does all that advertising really work? To the corporations who budget hundreds of  millions  or  even  billions  of  dollars  annually  for  television  commercials,  radio  and magazine  ads,  internet  'pop-ups,'  and  direct  mail  ads,  the  answer  is  clearly  Yes! Advertisements  come  at  us  from  all  sides  and  we  tend  to  absorb  them  whether  we consciously realize it or not. Once absorbed, they can influence our buying habits. Why do you buy the products you buy when you shop? How do you choose one brand over another? Why are you likely to feel you are making a sacrifice if you buy the cheaper house brands or plain wrapped brands instead of the familiar name brand you really want (because of its perceived greater attractiveness) (Philipchalk & McConnell, 1994)?\nAdvertising  as  an  industry  makes  great  use  of  suggestive  techniques  to  attempt  to influence  you  to  buy  a  product.  How  do  advertisers  do  this?  They  typically  begin  by creating a need for a product (for many centuries, bad breath or body odor was not on the forefront  of  people's  consciousness).  Then  they  use  techniques  such  as  promoting  an identification with the person in the ad so you'll realize you can solve your problem by using the product in the same way it was modeled for you. Finally, they strengthen your buying habit by rewarding you for having made such a fine choice, essentially telling you how enlightened you are and how much better your life will be for having the wisdom (or guts,  or  sex  appeal,  or  some  other  trait)  to  choose  their  product.  Ads  try  to  generate feelings (e.g., pleasure) or other associations (e.g., scientific data confirming  its superiority) that will be tied to the product that may induce you to purchase it instead of another brand (Pratkanis & Aronson, 1991). The field of advertising is obviously much more complex than this brief description may suggest, but the salient point here is that advertising  uses  words  and  images  in  a  way  that  is  intended  to  influence  your  buying behaviors and perhaps even your lifestyle. And it works! Can the field of hypnosis learn something from studying the dynamics of influence evident in advertising? Specifically, how does an image or idea translate into a change of behavior?\nAn ad may last only a matter of seconds, or perhaps as much as a minute on television (not  counting  the  lengthier  'infomercials'  that  can  last  up  to  half  an  hour!).  Ad  time typically costs a great deal of money, yet advertisers know most people don't pay much conscious attention to the commercial, their attention often drifting off to other places. Can  the commercial  still be influential even if it is not focused upon?  Social psychological and cognitive research suggest messages may  be absorbed at an unconscious  level,  where  a  feeling  of  recognition  can  be  triggered  when  you  see  the product  in  the  store,  a  phenomenon  known  as  'priming'  (Lynn  &  Sherman,  2000; Sherman, 1988). Social psychology has shown in many different studies that the more familiar an item is to us, the more positive regard we tend to have for it (familiarity is generally positive; for example, when you are in an unfamiliar location while traveling, and you become hungry, you may be relieved to see a familiar hamburger restaurant). Repetition  and  familiarity  are  positive  means  for  getting  messages  across.  In  our conscious  experience,  repetition  is  often  boring,  but  the  unconscious  mind  seems  to respond to it when the message isn't perceived as threatening (Aronson, 1999).",

        "text": "Every  day,  human  beings  are  bombarded  by  hundreds,  and  by  some  researchers' estimates, thousands, of messages (Philipchalk & McConnell, 1994). Each message is, in a sense, an advertisement-some quite overt (such as television commercials), some less so  (such  as  when  your  friends  comment  favorably  on  a  particular  restaurant).  Each interaction you are involved in will influence your experience in some way, whether the interaction lasts only a moment or many hours. Can you think of any interaction in any context  in  which  one  person  is  not  influencing  another?  Even  in  your  own  internal dialogue, is there anything significant you can say to yourself that doesn't affect you in some way?\nTherapeutic  intervention  involves  influencing  other  people  sufficiently  to  alter  their experience of themselves in a beneficial way. Therapy in any modality requires guiding the  client  from  a  state  of  distress  and  dissatisfaction  with  some  portion  of  his  or  her experience to a new, more satisfying and effective way of living. Therapy encourages the development  of  a  more  adaptive  means  for  coping  with  life  circumstances,  especially stressful ones. Whatever form therapy takes, from taking pills to recording and correcting dysfunctional thoughts, the client is learning to experience him- or herself in a new way, one that allows for greater flexibility, new possibilities, and inner satisfaction. How does a  clinician  do  this?  What  is  it  a  therapist  says  or  does  that  influences  the  client  in  a beneficial way? Is this ability to influence someone positively a property of the clinician? Certainly the therapist's skill, demeanor, and knowledge are factors. Is the ability to be influenced a property of the client? Certainly a motivation to change and a willingness to experiment  with  new  behaviors  are  factors.  Is  being  a  catalyst  for  change  in  the therapeutic context (or any other context, for that matter) an interaction of the two? The relationship  between  hypnotist  and  client  (or  you  and  your  friend,  or  a  barber  and  his customer,  or  a  talk  show  guest  and  the  audience)  is  one  that  involves  the  unique characteristics of each party relating to the other such that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The characteristics of each affect the other, and an outcome of some sort-a quality of relationship-is inevitable.\nWhat  is  suggestibility  in  hypnosis?  It  is  an  openness  to  accepting  new  ideas,  a willingness  to  absorb  new  information  or  perspectives.  Furthermore,  it  is  a  focused capacity  to  translate  ideas  into  suggested  responses.  As  new  information  is  acquired, depending on its subjective value, it can alter the person's experience anywhere from a little to a lot. In the therapeutic interaction, the person to be influenced (i.e., the client) is, to some  unknown  degree,  suggestible  and  wants  to  acquire  new  information  or experience that will reduce his or her distress. The person is unhappy with some aspect of him- or herself, and seeks help from an experienced clinician who might be able to say or do something to make a difference.\nFew  people  are  completely  noncritical  in  accepting  information,  and  so  there  is  an important difference between suggestibility and gullibility (T. Barber, 1969). Suggestibility as a trait exists because each person recognizes that he or she is limited; after  all,  no  one  person  knows  all  there  is  to  know  about  everything. No  matter  how knowledgeable you are in an area, your information remains incomplete. When we brush up  against  those  areas  we  recognize  we  know  little  about,  we  tend  to  become  more\nsuggestible to the influence of others we believe may know more.",

You can probably recall a situation you were in recently that was new to you, and how uncomfortable you felt because you really weren't sure whether you were doing  things  in  the  proper  way.  Pause  for  a  moment  and  think  about  such  a  situation. How  much  did  you  rely  on  others  to  guide  your  behavior?  Everyone  has  had  an experience  like  that  simply  because  it's  an  inevitable  part  of  the  socialization  process. You may not have acted properly, but at least you're not alone!\nThe  old Candid  Camera television  show  played  on  the  themes  of  uncertainty  and conformity by deliberately confusing people and enjoying their confusion as they would try to figure things out, desperately trying to make sense out of an absurd situation. (For example, in one episode a 'special' car rolls into a gas station, and the driver asks for service.  Upon  lifting  the  hood  of  the  car,  the  attendant  is  astonished  to  discover  the vehicle has no engine! The look of utter bewilderment on the attendant's face made for great television.) Typically, people's first response in the scenarios they found themselves in was to look for outside guidance, asking someone else to help them figure out what to do. Often the person they'd turn to was an accomplice to the hoax, further complicating things for the poor 'victim.'\nThe  principle  of  increased  conformity  in  the  face  of  uncertainty  is  immediately relevant  to  the  clinical  context  (Erickson,  1964).  A  clinician  will  have  some  potential influence arising from the client's perception that he or she is mismanaging some portion of  his  or  her  life.  The  problems  are  seemingly  beyond  control,  and  are  a  source  of confusion and uncertainty as to what to do to solve them. Attempts at self-correction have failed, and  so the person  then  seeks  help from  someone  presumed  to  be  more knowledgeable about solving the problem by virtue of having advanced clinical training. (Some people would rather talk to a hairdresser than a doctor, some would rather confide in a co-worker than a psychologist, and still others would rather write a letter to 'Dear Abby' than talk directly to anyone at all. People may invest power in someone simply because they think, rightly or wrongly, the person is more knowledgeable than they are.)\nIf  someone  has  attempted  change  and  failed  (who  hasn't?),  the  suggestion  may  be accepted that one who is professionally trained in such matters will be able to help. The helping professional is perceived as an authority on a personal problem because he or she has been trained to recognize causes and administer treatments. The person seeking help has already accepted his own ignorance and powerlessness about the situation, and with a strong sense of hopefulness, looks to the therapist as the person who can make the hurt go away.\nThe  quality  of  the  relationship  between  the  clinician  and  the  client  has  been  well established as a primary basis for the therapeutic experience in general and the hypnotic\nexperience in particular. Every therapy I am aware of emphasizes the importance of the therapeutic  alliance  (Hubble,  Duncan,  &  Miller,  1999).  In  the  application  of  clinical hypnosis, the therapeutic alliance has the potential to be well defined when one develops a  recognition  of  the  factors  that  contribute  to  it.  These  are  discussed  throughout  the remainder of this chapter.",

Power  is  not  typically  something  the  clinician  simply  has;  rather,  it  is  acquired from the client's reaction to him or her (Spinelli, 1994). Thus, power is a capacity and a potential,  and  not a personality trait. A clinician has the potential to  be  influential,  but every clinician learns the hard way through unsuccessful cases that influence is hardly a given in doing therapy. How do some clients come to see the clinician as allpowerful and readily comply with his or her directives, while others successfully resist the influence of the clinician, even to their own detriment?",

        "text": "A famous and highly controversial set of experiments on the dynamics of power were done by social psychologist Stanley Milgram (1974). These illustrated most dramatically how much power can be given to a person in a position of authority, and worked so well that  seemingly  normal  people  could  be  led  to  apparently  inflict  harm  on  others  in  the name of compliance.\nMilgram devised a basic experiment which was eventually performed in a variety of ways (i.e., varying the proximity, location, etc.). It involved deceiving naïve experimental subjects,  misleading  them  to  believe  they  were  involved  in  an  experiment  on  learning. Directions were simultaneously given to the naïve subjects and to confederates (accomplices)  of  the  experimenter  (whom  naïve  subjects  naturally  assumed  were  also naïve subjects like themselves) indicating that the purpose of the study was to discover whether  the  use  of  punishment,  in  the  form  of  electrical  shocks,  would  increase  a subject's  ability  to  learn  word  pairs.  Naïve  subjects  would  be  assigned  the  role  of teachers,  and  confederates  the  role  of  learners.  Teachers  watched  as  the  learners  were strapped into a chair and hooked up to the shock-delivering electrodes. Teachers listened as the learner disclosed having a heart condition. Then they were placed in a nearby room and  positioned  in  front  of  the  shock  generator.  The  shock  generator  was  marked  with specific  escalating  voltage  levels  (e.g.,  15,  30,  45  volts,  etc.),  as  well  as  qualitative descriptors (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, extreme shock). Teachers were then instructed to deliver to learners a shock of increasing intensity with each incorrect response.\nTeachers  were  convinced  that  the  learners  were  getting  shocked  by  their  action  of pressing  the  button.  As  the  shock  levels  escalated  ever  higher  as  the  experiment progressed, the shrieks (e.g., 'Owww!!') and pounding on the wall (e.g., 'Let me out of here…my heart is starting to bother me!') coming from the learner's room seemed ample\nevidence that learners were truly being shocked at their initiation. In reality, however, the learners were not being shocked at all. Not knowing that, though, meant teachers had to determine  for  themselves  how  far  they  were  willing  to  carry  the  experiment.  Most subjects  in  the  teacher  position  were  very  anxious  and  became  reluctant  to  let  the experiment progress,  often  turning  to  the  experimenter  for  guidance  and  permission  to end the experiment. The experimenter's job was simply to say, 'You must go on. You have no choice but to continue. The experiment must go on.'\nMore  than  50%  of  the  teachers  delivered  the  highest  possible  shock  level,  past  the point  on  the  machine  labeled,  'Danger:  Severe  Shock'  and  past  the  point  where  the shrieking learner became eerily silent and may literally have been dead, for all the teacher knew.  This  dramatic  experiment,  one  that  could  not  be  done  by  today's  standards  of research ethics,  was  based  on  the  'obedience  to  authority'  phenomenon  evident  in  the Nuremberg  War  Crimes  Trials  following  World  War  II.  Many  Nazis  charged  with exceptionally atrocious crimes claimed as a defense that, 'I was just following orders.' Milgram wanted to know whether this was a phenomenon unique to Nazis, or whether anyone might be induced to harm another person in the name of obeying an authority. The  inescapable  conclusion  is  troubling:  People  will  go  to  great  lengths  to  obey  an authority they perceive as credible and/or if they see no choice other than to obey. If the person perceives that there are no viable alternatives, he or she will likely follow orders even  if  they  are  destructive  ones.  Some  subjects  in  Milgram's  experiment,  when  told 'You have no choice…you must continue with the experiment,' planted their arms firmly on  their  chests  and  said,  'On  the  contrary,  I  have  a  lot  of  choice,  and  I  refuse  to continue.' Such subjects were in the minority, however. Most people simply obeyed. The phenomenon of obedience to authority is observable in many routine contexts, including business ('Do this or you're fired'), education ('Do this or you'll be dropped from the program'), and even some  intimate relationships ('Do  this or I'll leave you'). Relationships are inevitably built on a markedly disproportionate balance of power, yet not  everyone  is  willing  to  use  power  abusively  to  deliberately  hurt  others  for  personal gain. Those that are, though, can make our lives considerably more difficult.\nThe social psychological issue of obedience to authority has generated research into the  question  of  whether  hypnosis  as  a  phenomenon  exists  or  whether  it  is  merely compliance  with  the  hypnotist's  suggestions.  Lynn  &  Sherman  addressed  this  issue directly  and  clearly  when  they  said,  'Of  course  if  hypnosis  were  nothing  more  than compliance  or  faking  it  would  be  of  little  interest  to  anyone.  However,  hypnosis  is interesting  to  sociocognitive  theorists  precisely  because  of  the  'believed  in'  subjective alterations  it  evokes  (2000,  p.  296).'  As  Nicholas  Spanos,  Ph.D.,  a  leading  hypnosis researcher  on  the  issue  concluded  from  the  research,'…the  available  data  also  suggest that compliance, in and of itself, cannot account adequately for hypnotic behavior (1991, p. 336).' The wary clinician should appreciate that compliance is a factor in treatment, with or without hypnosis, and the demands made on the client must therefore be chosen with  care.  Beyond  compliance,  though,  hypnosis  engenders  a  responsiveness  that  is special and worthy of additional consideration in its use.",

        "text": "Where  does  the  power  of  a  clinician  (or  a  researcher  like  Milgram)  come  from?  The status of the therapist is one key factor, and his or her perceived expertness is another. Probably  the  greatest  capacity  for  power,  however,  comes  from  the  social  role  the therapist is in; the clinician-client relationship is generally not, and usually never is, one of  equals  (Spinelli,  1994;  Szasz,  1978).  The  person  coming  in  for  help  must  divulge personal and sensitive information to a person about whom he or she knows very littleonly his or her professional status, and, for the more inquisitive, academic background and clinical training.\nThe client is in a position of revealing his or her problems, inadequacies, and fears to a person who seems to be going through life successfully and relatively carefree for the most  part.  This  is  more  or  less  true  depending  on  the  amount  of  self-disclosure  an individual clinician feels comfortable in making. Sometimes too much self-disclosure can hurt  the  relationship,  other  times  not  enough  can  be  detrimental.  Regardless,  the relationship is characterized by the clinician being the expert, the authority, and a client's uncertainty about how to solve a problem or an inability to detect personal choices can easily  induce  obedience  to  the  authority  of  the  clinician.  Consider  how  extreme  some forms  of  treatment  are,  and  even  many  that  are  just  silly,  yet  how  willingly  people comply with what they are told by the 'expert' to do.\nThere are at least five different types of power: (1) coercive (derived from the ability to punish); (2) reward (derived from the ability to give benefits ranging from monetary to psychological);  (3)  legitimate  (derived  from  position,  including  elected  and  selected positions);  (4)  expert  (derived  from  greater  knowledge  in  an  area);  and,  (5)  referent power (derived from personal characteristics, such as likeability or charisma). All five of these powers may be operational in almost any context to one degree or another, but they are especially prevalent in the therapeutic context.\nThe  role  of  a  clinician  can  be  a  powerful  one  in  the  therapeutic  relationship.  The capacity for influence in using principles and techniques of clinical hypnosis must lead each one of us to consider the phenomenon of power in relationships if we are to use power sensitively for the benefit of the client. Those who deny their power to influence and see themselves as separate from the client's treatment process are at the highest risk for  being  oblivious  to  their  impact.  As  you  will  discover,  this  point  became  especially critical in the acrimonious debate over the repressed memory controversy which peaked in the middle of the last decade. Many therapists simply didn't grasp that they played a role in the type and quality of memories that emerged from their digging.",

A  basic  need  people  seem  to  have,  which  is  the foundation  of  any  society,  is  other  people.  When  you  combine  a  feeling  of  deficiency with  a  need  for  others,  the  drive  for  acceptance  begins  to  emerge.  Acceptance  is something we all want in varying degrees. Is there anyone who is truly indifferent to the\nreactions of others? Or anyone who genuinely likes rejection? How far are you willing to go to get the approval of others who are important to you?\nOne of the fears often in the mind of clients coming in for help is, 'If I open myself up to you, and let you see all my fears, doubts, quirks, and imperfections, will you like me and accept me? Or will you find me weak, repulsive, and reject me?' The potential for acceptance or rejection by the clinician is a risk the client takes in seeking help, and in light  of  all  the  evidence  for  the  potential  power  of  the  therapeutic  alliance,  it  is  a legitimate  concern  (Rogers,  1963).  Recognizing  and  respecting  the  client's  need  for acceptance is an important factor to consider in addressing the issues of whether and how the client conforms to the demands of clinical intervention. How far is your client willing to go to get your approval?",

        "text": "Among the most well-known studies in the literature of social psychology is the classic work  of  Solomon  Asch  on  conformity  (1951,  1955,  1956).  Asch  designed  numerous studies to determine how others might influence us in terms of our perceptions, decisions, and attitudes. In a famous one, Asch brought in three confederates to interact with a lone naïve subject for an experiment on perception, or so the naïve subject was told. In reality, the  experiment  was  one  studying  the  dynamics  of  conformity,  defined  as  a  person changing behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes in the direction of others around him or her.\nAsch presented to the group a series of different sized lines, labeled lines A, B, and C, and a fourth line, X. The task of the group members seemed a simple one: They were to identify which one of lines A, B, and C was closest in size to line X. The discrimination task was an easy one since the lines were generally of distinctly different sizes. The first few rounds, by design, found all four subjects in total agreement with each other. In later rounds,  though,  the  confederates  had  been  given  instructions  to  give  an  obviously incorrect  answer.  To  the  naïve  subject,  the  three  other  people  in  the  group  were generating  a  seemingly  incorrect  answer,  but  they  were  unanimous  and  their  previous judgments  had  been  just  fine.  This  unexpected  wrinkle  generated  a  great  deal  of uncertainty and anxiety in the naïve subjects. The typical naïve subject was so confused that when the other three subjects all agreed on an answer that seemed wrong, the subject conformed  and  also  gave  that  incorrect  answer!  Follow-up  revealed  that  privately  the person's perceptions hadn't actually changed. He or she simply conformed to the group.\nWhy would experimental subjects express obviously incorrect opinions as their own in the group context? Through earlier trials of total agreement, a group identity had formed, a group belongingness and even an interdependence. 'Belonging' meets a basic need of people.  To  openly  disagree  and  act  as  a  nonconformist,  effectively  cutting  oneself  off from the others, was too uncomfortable a prospect for many of Asch's subjects to bear. People want the emotional and other intangible benefits of being enough like others to have  a  sense  of  belonging.  A  basic  principle  guiding  relationships  according  to  the literature of social psychology, and verifiable in your own experience, is that similarity is rewarding, dissimilarity is punishing.\nThe need for acceptance and the need to belong are also factors present in the hypnotic relationship.  Avoiding  confrontations  with  the  authority,  doing  things  to  please  him  or",

Relative to the above discussion on power, this is where a clinician's reward power can become a considerable force in the treatment process.\nSpanos, Flynn, & Gabora (1989) conducted an experiment involving hypnosis which closely  paralleled  Asch's  conformity  experiments.  They  gave  45  highly  hypnotizable hypnotic  subjects  a  suggestion  that  when  they  opened  their  eyes  during  hypnosis  they would see a blank piece of paper. In fact, the paper shown them had a number 8 drawn on it  that  was  large  and  clearly  visible.  Fifteen  of  the  45,  a  full  third  of  them,  stated repeatedly the paper was blank. After the hypnosis was ended and another experimenter professing  neutrality  about  their  experience  questioned  them  about  what  they  'really' saw,  and  asked  them  to  draw  what  they  had  seen.  Fourteen  of  the  15  who  originally claimed the paper was blank drew a number 8. There is clearly a difference between what people may claim to experience versus what they actually experience. No clinical context can  fully  avoid  what  are  known  as  the  'demand  characteristics'  of  treatment,  but  an aware clinician can strive to foster less compliance and more internalization on the part of the client.",

        "text": "The  effects  of  our  expectations  on  our  experience  can  be  profound.  The  power  of expectation has been demonstrated in numerous places and called by many names, and virtually  all  models  of  psychotherapy  emphasize  the  value  of  positive  expectations  in enhancing  treatment  results  (Kirsch,  1990;  Lynn  &  Garske,  1985).  Probably  the  most widely used term is 'self-fulfilling prophecy,' describing how  our behavior is unconsciously  aligned  with  our  expectations,  whether  good  or  bad,  increasing  the likelihood of their eventual fulfillment.\nWhen  someone  comes  in  for  help,  or  for  information,  typically  that  person  has  an expectation  of  how  things  are  going  to  turn  out.  The  more  emotional  investment  the person  has  in  that  expectation,  the  less  likely  he  or  she  is  to  experience  anything  that contradicts it. For example, if someone has the idea that a problem he or she is trying to solve is hopeless or unsolvable, then potential solutions people might offer him or her go untried. This causes the problem to remain unsolved, and reaffirms the 'correctness' of his or her view that it is unsolvable. In another example, if someone has the self-flattering idea that he or she is a wonderful person whom everyone sees as kind and sensitive, and someone comes along and tells him or her that he or she did something really mean, he or she might dismiss it as evidence of envy, reaffirming to him- or herself that he or she really is kind and sensitive. This circular kind of process is called a 'calibrated cycle' in the  world  of  systems  theory,  and  essentially  it  describes  a  mechanism  whereby  people can work very hard at staying the same, whether the effect is to maintain a good or poor self-image.\nExpectations  can  either  work  for  or  against  the  attainment  of  desired  outcomes, depending on their positive or negative quality. In the course of clinical practice, people\nmay specifically seek you out because they have been referred to you by someone else you impressed, increasing the odds of your being able to impress that person, too. Or, the person has a positive expectation because of your affiliation with an institution he or she holds in high esteem, or because of your title and status, or for any of dozens of possible reasons.  Unfortunately,  people  can  have  negative  expectations  for  equally  arbitrary reasons: They don't like your gender, your age, your walk, the institution you work for, the length of time they had to wait to see you, and on and on. Addressing the issue of expectations-both yours and the client's-makes good clinical sense.\nSome of the older hypnosis rituals aim to build positive expectations in the client that he or she can have, or already is having, the experience of hypnosis. Some of the tests associated  with  various  susceptibility  measures  discussed  earlier  are  included  solely  to convince the test subject that he or she has experienced some altered state. For example, when a subject is given suggestions for being unable to open his or her eyes (called 'eye catalepsy') and then is challenged to do so, if he or she passes that test by being unable to open his or her eyes, then he or she is better convinced of being in hypnosis. This may create  an  expectation  of  benefit  from  hypnosis  and  foster  greater  receptivity  to  further suggestions of the hypnotist.\nMany of the things that are considered basic to a professional practice are intended to build positive expectations on the part of the client. Why hang your diplomas on a wall? Why print business cards with a fancy title? Why adopt a professional demeanor, other than  to  instill  confidence  your  client?  My  work  with  depressed  clients  in  particular, people who suffer hopelessness and despair and thus have only negative expectations, has taught  me  how  vitally  important  positive  expectations  are  for  eventual  recovery.  The clinical challenge is to build hopefulness out of hopelessness, and I have described some ways of doing that hypnotically elsewhere (Yapko, 1992, 2001). Suffice it to say here that helping clients co-create a compelling vision of what's possible in their lives is one of the most important things that can happen in therapy.\nPsychologist  Irving  Kirsch,  Ph.D.,  of  the  University  of  Connecticut  has  been  an especially  vocal  proponent  of  a  view  of  hypnosis  that  claims  hypnosis  is mostly about expectancy  (1990,  1991,  1994,  1997).  He  said,  'expectancy  is  an  essential  aspect  of hypnosis, perhaps its most essential aspect' (1990, p. 143). His research has been quite compelling  in  demonstrating  how  hypnotic  responses  are  influenced  by  the  clients' beliefs and expectations. Thus, for the client, a good hypnotic induction is one that the client believes is a good one, and a good hypnotic experience is one that fits with what the  client  believes  one  to  be  (Kirsch,  1990).  Kirsch's  recommendation  that  clinicians need to present convincing reasons for introducing hypnosis into the therapy and in ways that fit with the client's needs and beliefs is sound advice (1994).\nWhat  it  takes  to  build  positive  expectations  for  treatment  in  a  person  varies  from individual  to  individual.  Skillfully  finding  out  what  a  person  needs  in  order  to  build positive  expectations  can  be  a  major  catalyst  to  getting  hypnosis  and  the  therapeutic process going in a helpful direction.

        "text": "Theodore Xenophon Barber, Ph.D. (1927-) has had a remarkable professional career,  having  been  continuously  involved  with  practicing  and  researching hypnosis since his early training in the 1950s as a stage hypnotist. He had first been drawn to hypnosis as a graduate student, crediting the work of Dr. A.A. Mason from a case study published in the British Medical Journal involving the use of hypnosis to help improve an intractable skin condition in a 16-yearold  boy.  It  catalyzed  his  lifelong  fascination  with  hypnosis,  the  mind-body relationship, and how suggestions translate into multi-dimensional responses.\nBy the early 1960s, research publications bearing the name of T.X. Barber became both frequent and highly influential. Dr. Barber posed an immediate intellectual  challenge  to  the  field  of  hypnosis  that  simply  could  not  be ignored.  His  experience  as  a  stage  hypnotist  and  his  early  experiments  had made  it  clear  to  him  that  the  notion  of  some  vaguely  defined  and  esoteric phenomenon called 'trance' was an unnecessary creation in order to explain hypnotic  behavior.  Instead,  Dr.  Barber  proposed  that  the  phenomenon  of hypnosis  was  best  understood  in  social  terms,  a  concept  well  ahead  of  its time. While others at the time were heavily invested in the notion of a special state of consciousness, Dr. Barber was conducting research which illustrated his key point: When the setting was appropriate, and subjects were motivated to carry out the suggested task, their responses were not significantly different from  those  who  had  gone  through  the  rituals  of  hypnosis.  His  view  of hypnosis  as  grounded  in  social  phenomena  has  only  grown  stronger  over time. In an exceptionally detailed and clear exposition of his research findings and their implications which he published in the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis in January 2000,\nDr.  Barber  said:  'We  can  view  hypnosis  in  its  broader  context,  as  a  social phenomenon par  excellence,  when  we  see  how  much  of  it  is  explained  by basic principles of the social sciences which have been thoroughly documented by several generations  of  cultural  anthropologists,  sociologists, and social psychologists' (p. 232).\nDr. Barber's clinical experience has been almost as varied as his research interests. He has worked with hypnosis in the psychiatric setting with patients considered  seriously  disturbed;  he  has  worked  with  elderly  patients  in  a geriatric  facility;  and  he  has  employed  hypnosis  in  the  course  of  private practice.  Dr.  Barber's  research  interests  have  included  the  relationships between personality and hypnotizability (especially emphasizing the responsiveness  of  fantasy  prone  and  amnesia-prone  individuals),  hypnosis and  altered  states  of  consciousness,  hypnosis  and  learning,  hypnosis  and human potential, hypnosis and healing, and hypnosis and almost everything!\nHis interests are exceptionally varied, and have led to writings on unexpected topics, including his observations about animal intelligence which he addressed in a provocatively titled book called The Human Nature of Birds . He has authored dozens of significant articles and book chapters on hypnosis, and several classic books in the field, including Advances in Altered States of Consciousness and Human Potentialities (1980); Hypnosis, Imagination and Human Potentialities (with Nicholas Spanos and John Chaves, 1974); and his landmark  work, Hypnosis:  A  Scientific  Approach (originally  published  in 1969 and reprinted in 1995).\nDr. Barber is a past president of the American Psychological Association's Division 30, now called the Society of Psychological Hypnosis, having served from  1971  to  1972.  During  his  career  in  Massachusetts,  he  has  been associated with Harvard and Boston Universities, Medfield (State) Hospital, and  Cushing  (Geriatric)  Hospital,  and  is  now  at  the  Research  Institute  for Interdisciplinary  Science  in  Ashland,  Massachusetts.  Dr.  Barber's  work  has been and continues to be a major influence on my thinking about and practice of hypnosis despite our never (yet) having met in person.\nO n  His  Early  Academic  Training: 'My  first undergraduate  major, focusing on the great philosophers, stimulated my interest in such questions as,  What  is  the  nature  and  essence  of  reality-Life  and  Death,  Mind  and Matter,  God  and  the  Universe?  I  then  went  on  to  a  second  undergraduate career  concentrating  on  the  'hard'  sciences,  especially  the  vast  realms  of biology.  These  studies  led  me  to  conclude  that  serious  work  on  basic questions,  especially  those  pertaining  to  mentality,  consciousness,  and  the mind-body problem, required a deeper understanding of psychology.'**\nOn His Hypnosis Training: 'While working on the Ph.D. in psychology, I read  widely  in  the  fascinating  history  of  hypnotism,  and  I  realized  that hypnosis was a 'royal road' for attacking fundamental questions by scientific methods.  Since  academic  and  professional  training  in  hypnosis  was  not available  in  those  years,  I  studied  with  a  stage  hypnotist  and  I  used  this training to help earn a living while in graduate school. After carrying out a series  of  experiments  on  hypnosis  as  part  of  my  doctoral  dissertation  at American  University  and  post-doctoral  research  work  at  Harvard,  I  was fortunate to receive continuous research grants from the National Institutes of Health  which  enabled  me  to  investigate  hypnosis  and  its  ramifications intensively over several decades.'**\nO n Effective Hypnosis without a Formal Induction: 'With or without a preceding  hypnotic  procedure,  experimental  subjects  obtain  relatively  high scores on hypnotic susceptibility or suggestibility scales (which include tests for arm levitation, arm rigidity, analgesia, age regression, sensory hallucination,  post-experimental  behavior  and  amnesia)  when  they  have positive attitudes toward  the hypnotic or suggestive situation, positive\nmotivations  to  experience  hypnosis  (or  the  suggested  effects),  and  positive expectancies that they can experience what is suggested. These positively set subjects experience a variety of suggested effects (of the type associated with hypnosis) because they think and imagine along with the suggestions while letting go of interfering thoughts.'*\nO n  Situational  Factors  and  Hypnosis: 'The  extent  to  which  subjects experience suggested effects varies with a series of situational factors. These include  a  variety  of  social  factors  such  as  social  demands,  roles,  and expectations  that  obligate  socialized  individuals  to  cooperate  and  comply. They also include: the experimenter's or hypnotist's characteristics and skills (such as communicative abilities, creative ideas, and ability to bond with the subject); the effectiveness of the preliminary pro-cedures or hypnotic induction  procedures  in  guiding  the  subject  to  think  and  imagine  with  the suggestions;  and  the  suggested  ideas  themselves-their  depth  of  meaning, their creativity, and their potency for the particular subject.'*\nO n Exceptional 'Fantasy Prone' Hypnotic Subjects: 'A small proportion  of  the  experimental  subjects  have  unusual  life  histories  and personality characteristics that predispose them to respond easily and dramatically  to  hypnotic  procedures  and  suggestions.  We  called  one  group, comprising less than 4% of our subjects, 'fantasy prone' individuals because of their unique life histories. During childhood, each spent an incredibly large proportion of time in fantasy-based activities such as\npretend-play,  make-believe,  imagining  companions,  vivid  daydreaming,  and imaginative  reliving  of pleasurable  sexual  experiences.  As  adults,  they secretly continue to spend much of their time fantasizing, and they typically insist  they  see,  hear,  feel,  and  experience  what  they  fantasize.  In  hypnosis experiments they use their well-developed talent for vivid, realistic fantasy to perceive  and  interact  in  a  profoundly  realistic  way  with  the  suggested (hallucinatory) object, to experience vivid age regression (as they supplement their  early  memories  with  their  fantasies  of  the  suggested  earlier  time),  to experience  analgesia  by  deliberately  fantasizing  they  are  in  a  different situation (without the pain stimulus), and so on.'*\nO n  Exceptional  'Amnesia  Prone'  Hypnotic  Subjects: 'The  second group  of  exceptionally  responsive  subjects,  who  we  labeled  as  'amnesia prone,' comprise about 1% of a student sample. They are characterized by the many  kinds  of  amnesias  they  have  experienced  in  their  lives,  typically including  amnesia  for  virtually  all  of  their  childhood,  amnesia  for  other scattered periods in their lives, 'lapses' or micro-amnesias in their daily lives, and  amnesia  for  their  dreams.  In  hypnotic  situations  they  typically  respond like deep trance subjects or somnambules, manifesting a sleep-like appearance,  passivity, automatic-like  responsiveness  to  suggestions,  and convincing  post-hypnotic  amnesia.  Both  their  trance-like  hypnotic  behavior\nand their various amnesias are related to childhood physical, psychological, and, often, sexual abuse during which they learned to 'blank out' or enter an 'away'  state,  and  to  mentally  compartmentalize  (or  repress,  dissociate,  or forget) particular stimuli or events.'*\nO n  His  Varied  Experiences  Informing  His  Views: 'Our  experimental research played the biggest role (in shaping my views). However, my clinical work  using  hypnotic  procedures  in  therapy,  in  which  I  became  wellacquainted with the life experiences of a substantial number of subjects, was important  in  delineating  the  'fantasy  prone'  and  'amnesia  prone'  subjects. Experience  in  stage  hypnosis  contributed  to  the  conclusion  that  social situational variables, such as high expectancy, together with careful selection of highly responsive subjects and forceful suggestions is all that is needed to present  a  dramatic  stage  demonstration.  My  experience  in  self-hypnosis buttressed  the  conclusion  that  subjects  with  positive  attitudes,  motivations, and expectancies toward the suggested situation can experience a wide variety of suggested effects.'*\nO n  His  Most  Pleasant  Surprise  in  His  Work  with  Hypnosis:  'I was pleasantly surprised to realize that our research on producing physiological or bodily  changes  by  suggestions  (for  example,  successfully  suggesting  that localized warts would disappear) indicated a new and exciting\nsolution  to  the  mind-body  problem.  In  brief,  the  ability  to  produce  precise, localized  changes  in  the  body  by  words  or  suggestions  indicate  that  nerve cells literally communicate precise messages to other cells in the body which understand and implement the suggestions carried by the meaningful messages.  The  indication  that  cells  literally  communicate  precisely  and understand the  meaning of the communications, in turn, indicated that cells (and the organisms they constitute) are physicalmental entities or bodyminds . The mind-body problem disappears (or is solved) when cells and organisms are seen to be mentalized matter or embodied minds.'*\nO n  His  Personal  Interests: 'Like  most  people,  I  enjoy  my  family  and friends. I also enjoy the rain and the sun and the beautiful, boundless Earth. My unique 'hobby' goes back to that part of my childhood that took place on a Greek  island, when  I  learned to relate 'person-to-person' with the ubiquitous  animals  (donkeys,  pigs,  sheep,  goats,  squirrels,  birds,  and  even ants) and to appreciate the trees and wild plants and the magic of crops rising from  the  Earth.  Thus,  my  unique  present-day  pleasure,  which  began  in childhood and was greatly amplified and conceptualized by immersion in the literature on animal behavior, consists of literally interacting and communicating  (in  a  'shockingly'  intimate  way)  with  the  animals  in  my surroundings. A related pleasure is documenting with numerous studies that have  been  buried  in  the  literature,  the  (scientificallytabooed)  human-like intelligence  of  animals,  which  I  began  in  a  book  published  in  the  90's  and\nwhich I expand in a book I am writing now.'**\nSources: Personal communication, October 10, 2002\nPersonal communication, November 13, 2002",

        "text": "Often  when  I  flip  through  magazines,  I  am  astonished  by  the  claims  made  by  many advertised products. There are weight loss products that guarantee this product is so good that you can lose weight just by looking at it (only a slight exaggeration); there are books for sale that assure you of being able to acquire the dynamic personality that will get you into the most elite social circles; there are products that promise to clear up your skin, grow hair in your bald spots, cure your arthritis, make you a multimillionaire, turn your house into a showcase, give you 'washboard abs' in just a few weeks, and so on….\nWho buys these things? Who are the people in those pesky infomercials and magazine ads who enthusiastically describe how this product essentially gave them a reason to go on  living?  This  is  a  modern  version  of  an  old  theme.  Now  the  'medicine  show' testimonials are filmed in front of an enthusiastic studio audience, or put in print as a part of  the  advertisement,  to  show  you,  the  skeptical  buyer,  that  real  people,  not  unlike yourself,  have  purchased  this  product  and  experienced  a  desperately  wanted  magical transformation as a direct result. One hundred fifty years ago, the medicine show was a con man traveling in a covered wagon from town to town, with a confederate (or two) sent in advance, who would publicly purchase a bottle of the 'Doc Marvel Health Tonic' and instantly experience relief from every known ailment. Others wanting similar relief would purchase the tonic, earning the con man a nice profit. Mysteriously, though, some of them would feel better, too.\nCertainly,  the  person's  positive  expectation,  a  placebo  effect,  is  at  work  in  such instances. But there is also another factor to consider operating here: the need for internal consistency,  or  harmony,  based  on  Leon  Festinger's  classic  'cognitive  dissonance' concept (1957). People need to maintain their sense of themselves and part of how we do that is by striving to alleviate confusion and contradictions within ourselves. So we may omit  contradictory  bits  of  information,  or  we  may  twist  (i.e.,  distort)  such  information around until it all fits within us comfortably.\nConsider the issue of control from a different angle than that described earlier as an example. If I want to feel in control  of  myself,  how  can  I  comply  with  your  demands without  feeling  like  I'm  losing  control  of  myself?  Social  psychological  research  has shown  repeatedly  that,  like  clients  in  psychotherapy,  research  subjects  in  experiments perform far less well when they are aware of the induction of change, the goals of the situation, and the techniques of influence that are being used (Sherman & Lynn, 1990; Lynn & Sherman, 2000). Imagine Stanley Milgram or Solomon Asch informing research subjects 'We're testing how obedient to authority you are' or 'We're testing how likely to conform to others' incorrect judgments you are.' Indirection and even deception were used  to  elicit  spontaneous  behavior,  and  research  subjects  had  to  find  ways  within themselves to feel okay about themselves even while doing things that probably didn't\nfeel very good. People are generally quite adept at finding ways to make disparate pieces of experience fit together. But, the larger point here concerns appreciating many clients' resistance to what they may perceive as overt manipulation. Without a sense of control, people  can  feel  helpless,  and  so  they  may  wishfully  even  perceive  control  where  they have none, developing an 'illusion of control.' Effective use of hypnosis has to consider ways  to  reinforce  peoples'  sense  of  control  yet  paradoxically  encourage  them  to  step outside their 'comfort zone' in order to do something differently.\nPeople have a strong desire to feel certain, and when in an uncertain frame of mind, perhaps because of the novelty of the situation they're in, they will often turn to others to find out what to think. The more the explanation provided them fits their personal needs, the more easily the explanation is taken in at a deeper level. Thus, much of what we come to  believe  is  less  about  'truth'  and  is  more  about  what's  personally  desirable  or believable.\nIn  an  illustrative  piece  of  research  by  Schachter  and  Singer  (1962),  the  point  about uncertainty and turning to others to explain one's feelings is made clear. If you are chased by a bear and you experience a rapid pulse and heart rate, you can easily attribute the changes to fear. What if you were to experience those same physiological changes, but have  no  apparent  explanation  for  why?  Schachter  and  Singer's  experiment  involved injecting  subjects  either  with  epinephrine,  a  synthetic  form  of  adrenaline  causing physiological  excitation,  or  with  a  placebo.  Subjects  were  told  they  were  receiving  a vitamin supplement. Some of the subjects were told they would experience an increased heart rate as a side effect of the drug, but other subjects were not similarly informed. For those subjects who were not told of the side effects of the epinephrine, what were they to conclude  when  their  hearts  started  to  pound  in  their  chests  and  their  hands  began  to shake? Because they did not know what to make of it, they typically incorporated within themselves the reactions of those around them.\nConfederates of the experimenters were introduced into the experiment, and research subjects were told that this subject, like them, was also given an injection of the vitamin supplement.  The  confederate  had  been  given  instructions  on  how  to  behave.  In  some instances,  he  or  she  was  to  act  as  if  euphoric,  in  others  he  or  she  was  to  act  angry. Experimental  subjects,  uncertain  as  to  the  cause  of  their  physical  reactions,  generally behaved  in  the  same  manner  as  the  confederate.  Maslach  (1979)  failed  to  replicate Schachter and Singer's study, yet their study continues to be cited as illustrative of the principle of conformity in the face of ambiguity (Bordens & Horowitz, 2002).\nWhen subjects were certain  as  to  the  cause  of  their  reactions,  the  behavior  of  those nearby  had  little  or  no  effect  on  them.  When  they  were  uncertain,  though,  others' reactions  had  considerable  impact  on  them.  This  research  further  illustrates  how  the ambiguity of subjects' feelings led them to conform to others' perspectives. The need to make sense of our own reactions is an important part of developing self-awareness and being mentally healthy. But the influence of others clearly affects even the meanings we attach to our own internal experiences. What does this suggest to you about the potential vulnerabilities of our clients  to  the  interpretations  we  make  about  the  meaning of their experiences?\nThe experience of hypnosis is a highly subjective, often ambiguous, one that frequently leads clients to open their eyes after your hypnosis session and ask, 'Was that hypnosis?\nWas I hypnotized?' If you choose to answer directly by saying 'Yes, that was hypnosis' and  then  offering  what  sounds  to  the  client  like  specific  indicators  such  as,  'Did  you notice the changes in your breathing? And the changes in your musculature? And how relaxed  you  felt?…,'  then  quite  probably  the  client  will  adopt  your  apparently  expert perspective  of  the  ambiguous  interaction  as  if  it  were  his  or  her  own.  The  need  for certainty  and  the  need  to  have  a  perceptual  frame  into  which  the  experience  can  be integrated  may  motivate  the  person  to  simply  accept  your  explanation  of  the  hypnotic experience.\nThe need for cognitive consistency sometimes shows up in funny ways that highlight peoples'  often  quirky  natures.  In  one  now  classic  study,  researchers  investigated  an experimental confederate's ability to cut in front of a long line of people waiting their turns to use a copy machine (Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz, 1978). When the confederate simply asked people in line for permission to cut in front, compliance was only about 60%. (Aren't people nice?) When the confederate wanted to cut in front of the others but offered a meaningful reason, e.g., 'I have an important meeting and I'm running late,' the rate of compliance rose to 94%. But, when the confederate asked to cut in line and also offered a reason, but a totally uninformative one stating, 'Because I have to make some copies,' the rate of compliance was 93%! As Lynn and Sherman concluded (2000, p.  306),  'The  presence  of  a  request  plus  a  reason  seems  to  automatically  trigger  a compliance response…' Do you have a reason to suggest hypnosis to your client, and how good a reason do you have for wanting to do hypnosis?\nThe need for cognitive consistency surfaces in yet another way as a need, more or less depending  on  the  individual,  to  derive  at  least some benefit  from  having  received professional help. When people invest money, hope, and time in something, they usually genuinely  want  it  to  work,  even  if  'only  a  little.'  There  is  the  need  to  justify  the investment to themselves. This need increases with the amount of effort they have put into the treatment process. It's why many clinicians are quite forceful in their requirement that the client be a proactive and collaborative partner in the treatment process from the earliest stages of the therapy. 'Behavioral activation,' as it may be called (Martell, Addis, &  Jacobson,  2001),  is  a  vital  force  in  not  only  empowering  clients,  but  getting  them positively  invested  in  the  treatment.  And  it's  based  on  people's  need  to  believe  hard effort  and  personal  (including  financial)  investment  is  only  justified  by  success.  This same need is  evident  in  the  testimonials  of  people  who  have  bought  products  that  are virtually valueless, whose benefit was derived solely from their own wishful expectations.\nThere  can  be  a  negative  side  to  the  role  of  expectation  and  the  need  for  cognitive consistency. Consider the person who views him- or herself as a hopeless case, and then goes to great lengths to prove it. Some people, like the ones described earlier who go on stage  to  prove  they  cannot  be  'hypnotically  controlled,'  have  a  need  to  prove  their commitment to failure. It's a strange psychology, but unfortunately not a rare one, when success is determined by how much you fail. The patient who has been to every doctor in town and is inexplicably proud of his or her inability to be helped is a perfect example; the client who spends fruitless years in psychotherapy going from therapist to therapist is another.\nTestimonials in ads for junk products are sometimes a deceptive ploy, made up by the\nadvertiser. Often, however, they are the true feelings of consumers who attributed great power to a useless product. After all, they watched the whole infomercial twice, called within the time frame to get their 'bonus gift,' and they paid their $29.95, plus tax. And shipping and handling.",

By  communication  style,  I  refer  to  the  manner  with  which  you convey  information  and  communicate  possibilities  to  your  client.  There  are  many different styles, each having a different range and quality of impact on how receptive the client will be to the information and perspectives you present (T.Barber, 2000; J.Barber, 1991; Zeig, 2001).\nIf a clinician wants to get a message across to a client, he or she must consider what style  of  communication  this  person  is  most  likely  to  respond  to  in  the  desired  way. Should  the  interaction  be  one  of  rationality  and  reason,  or  would  an  emotional  appeal perhaps  work  better?  Should  the  techniques  used  be  direct  or  indirect?  Should  the position  adopted  be  a  supportive  one,  or  a  confrontive  one?  Would  it  be  better  to  be demanding  of  this  person,  or  nondemanding?  Will  an  incongruent  message  ('mixed message') have greater impact, or a congruent one? The structures and styles of hypnotic suggestions  will  be  dealt  with  in  great  detail  later;  suffice  it  to  say  here  that  there  are many ways to package ideas, and no single style is going to be effective with everyone. Suggestibility is a general human trait, but what a specific individual requires in order to respond well can vary dramatically.",

        "text": "Special attention has been paid throughout this chapter to developing an appreciation for the  social  psychology  of  hypnosis,  examining  how  people's  social  nature  has  the potential  to  empower  and  disempower  them.  Directly  and  indirectly,  I  have  addressed such fundamental topics as beliefs, expectations, attitudes, conformity, obedience, selfjustification, and compliance. If you read this chapter carefully, you may have discovered that hypnosis  in  the  clinical  context  might  best  be  understood  and  perhaps  most sensitively  applied  with  an  appreciation  for  your  power  to  influence  your  clients.  The challenge is how to do that in the most effective and respectful ways possible.\nEach of the factors  of  human  suggestibility  discussed  in  this  chapter  is  important  to consider in striving to understand what makes for good therapy as well as good hypnosis. There are no established rules about what makes for the most influential communication or the best hypnosis. What appeals to one person will not appeal to another. Some people appreciate and seek out professional help when distressed, while others would rather keep their problems to themselves or seek out the advice of a friendly neighbor. Some people want  to  be  told  exactly  what  to  do  in  a  rigid  step-by-step  fashion  and  follow  such directions  happily,  while  others  fight  against  such  explicit  directions,  perhaps  seeing\nthem as attempts to dominate them, and so prefer to be left alone to figure things out for themselves. Some people respond better if they have to go through rigorous demands to reach a goal (e.g., a therapist with a long waiting list is a frustration to such a new client who may perceive that therapist as better than he otherwise would have when he finally does  get  to  see  him  or  her),  while  others  won't  even  consider  putting  up  with  such demands (if faced with  a  long  waiting  list  they'll  just  go  see  another  therapist).  Some require  scientific  evidence  for  backing  up  almost  everything  you  say,  while  others  are suspicious of science and of those who promote it. Some people open up to the ideas of others  when  they're  confused,  while  others  close  off  and  try  to  resolve  the  confusion within themselves, even if they do so with misinformation.\nIn order to be truly effective in doing hypnosis, the task of the clinician is to discover under  what  conditions,  both  internal  and  external,  a  person  is  most  receptive  to  new information and suggested perspectives. The innate suggestibility of each individual, to one  degree  or  another  in  one  context  or  another,  makes  change  possible  and  allows growth to take place. The pro-cess of discovering what your client wants and how to best reach  him  or  her  is  the  process  of  building  the  therapeutic  alliance,  the  relationship between you that serves  as  the  foundation  for  the  techniques  you  eventually  introduce him or her to in your interventions (T.Barber, 2000; Geary, 2001).",

        "text": "The neurophysiology of the brain in hypnosis is clearly a fascinating realm of inquiry. How the brain functions in response to suggestion, which parts of the brain 'light up' with increased neural activity under suggested conditions, and how brain waves can be deliberately  conditioned through structured training experiences all  represent intriguing frontiers  of  exploration  into  human  consciousness.  To  the  clinician  wanting  to  apply hypnosis  in  treatment,  however,  the  more  immediate  consideration  is  how  a  person's brain gives rise to a person's mind . What characteristics of mental functioning influence people's ability to respond meaningfully to hypnosis?\nExposing  individuals  to  standardized  tests  of  hypnotizability  yields  overwhelming evidence  that  not  everyone  is  equally  hypnotizable,  even  with  the  most  flexible  of approaches to induction and the broadest definitions of what constitutes the condition of hypnosis. Assessing hypnotizability with standardized tests and even striving to enhance someone's  level  of  responsiveness  will  be  discussed  in  chapters  8  and  11.  But  the appropriate  question  to  address  at  this  point  is  this  one:  What  do  we  know  about  the relationship between conscious and unconscious mental processes and hypnosis? For the sake of simplicity, I will sometimes refer to the 'conscious mind' and the 'unconscious mind' at points in this chapter, as if they are distinct entities. However, you should be informed this is only convenient shorthand and not an accurate portrayal of the mind. It is more accurate to speak of conscious processes and unconscious processes, reflecting the dynamic nature of mental functioning.\nIn the most general sense, the rationale for employing hypnosis is to access, organize, and direct a client's mental resources for therapeutic purposes. 'Mental resources' covers a  lot  of  ground.  Are  these  resources  consciously  available  to  the  individual,  that  is, generally in his or her awareness? Some of them are. Are these resources unconscious, that is, generally outside of the person's awareness?  Some  of  them  are. Thus, characteristics  of  both  conscious  and  unconscious  processing  become  immediately relevant  in  forming  and  delivering  suggestions  to  the  client.  In  the  remainder  of  this section, we will explore some of these characteristics.\nAs you have learned, while there are different theories or philosophical frameworks for describing the phenomenon of hypnosis, there is a broad base of agreement as to what Ernest Hilgard (1973) called the 'domain of hypnosis,' referring to the various hypnotic phenomena such as posthypnotic amnesia and perceptual distortions. People absorbed in the  experience  of  hypnosis  are  able  to  organize  their  mental  processes  differently. Conscious  awareness  becomes  more  acute,  and  unconscious  processes  become  more accessible (Kihlstrom, 1985; McConkey, 1991).\nSuggestions are responded to simultaneously yet differently on multiple levels by the person  in  hypnosis,  the  principal  observation  leading  to  Hilgard's  development  of  his\ninfluential neodissociation  model  featuring  multiple  cognitive  controls  working  on multiple  levels.  Some  of  what  one  experiences  in  hypnosis  may  not  get  processed  or retained on conscious levels at all; the person has responses he or she isn't aware of at all, such as smiles or frowns in response to specific suggestions or internal experiences, such as  memories,  that  arise.  And,  the  person  may  remember  little  about  the  experience consciously after ending the hypnosis session, called posthypnotic amnesia. The fact that meaningful responses to suggestions can occur with little or no conscious involvement is some of  what  gives  hypnosis  the  aura  of  'magic.'  It  is  a  curious  thing,  indeed,  when someone follows a suggestion given during hypnosis that he or she has no recollection for having received, or has no conscious understanding for how a response, like numbness in a part of the body, was  achieved. For purists like Weitzenhoffer (2000), such nonvolitional responses to suggestion define hypnotic responding.\nIn  using  hypnotic  patterns,  suggestions  may  deliberately  be  formed  in  an  effort  to convey  meaning  to  the  client's  unconscious  while  his  or  her  conscious  awareness  is occupied elsewhere. Thus, acknowledging  the  differences between  conscious  and unconscious  characteristics  is  immediately  relevant  to  the  formulation  of  effective suggestions.",

        "text": "The conscious and unconscious each have a different set of functions, but also share a considerable number of functions between them (Kihlstrom, 1990). The overlap allows them to work together, while the differences can and sometimes do surface in internal conflict.  The  conscious  has  the  ability  to  analyze  things,  to  reason,  and  to  make judgments as to what is right or wrong. The conscious ultimately decides what is possible to do and what is not possible to do, although such decisions may well be-and usually are-based on influences (perhaps from past experiences, cognitive styles, or personality dynamics)  that  are  largely  unconscious  (Fromm,  1992;  Nash,  1992).  Thus,  it  can reasonably be said that the limitations in one's life are based on a conscious appraisal of experience. Everyone has the ability to seek out or create experiences that challenge their beliefs or expectations, if they so choose. In fact, isn't that how personal growth takes place? You tell yourself you can't, circumstances require you to, and then you happily discover you could. It doesn't always happen that way, of course, but it happens often enough to highlight that if you believe in your expectations noncritically, they become your reality (Kirsch, 1990). If you challenge them, your vision of what's possible grows. Hypnosis can work on both levels: boosting a conscious willingness to challenge oneself, and minimizing unconscious interferences that are the basis for being unnecessarily selflimiting. Directing and absorbing the client's conscious mind elsewhere in order to elicit responses at an unconscious level is often fundamental to the successful utilization of the more complex hypnotic phenomena.\nHow many things can you pay attention to at one time? Awareness is limited to just a few things at one time, and if too much comes in at once, the mind selectively attends to whatever  is  given  high  priority  based  on  personal  values,  motivation,  experience,  and other  such  factors.  Selective  attention  is  a  characteristic  of  hypnosis  in  the  client's",

        "text": "focusing on the clinician's  communications. Beyond the hypnotic interaction, selective attention  is  a  general  characteristic  of  human  information  processing.  Since  we  cannot pay attention to everything at once, the world is reduced to a manageable level through our  conscious  or  unconscious  selection  of  focal  points.  Communication  to  absorb  and occupy the client's conscious mind is the starting point in the hypnotic interaction; such communication is called an 'induction.'\nThe  unconscious  mind  is,  metaphorically,  a  reservoir  of  all  the  multidimensional experiences  acquired  throughout  your  lifetime,  including  your  historical  experience, personal  and  social  learnings,  manner  (drives,  motivations,  needs)  for  interacting  with one's  world,  and  your  automatic  functioning  in  countless  behaviors  each  day.  The unconscious mind, in contrast to the conscious mind, is not as rigid or analytical. It can respond to inferences between the lines, is capable of symbolic interpretation, and tends to be global in view (Fromm, 1992; Zeig, 1980).\nWhile  a  hypnotized  client  has  his  or  her  conscious  mind  occupied,  absorbed  and focused  through  the  process  of  selective  attention,  he  or  she  continues  to  process information  on  multiple  levels.  The  conscious  mind  may  be  minimally  involved,  as  in deeply  dissociated  states  historically  called  'somnambulism,'  with  a  limited  degree  of awareness  in  which  he  or  she  is  not  outwardly  responsive  by  choice.  For  example, assuming your attention is selectively focused on what you are reading here because you are interested in learning about hypnosis, your consciousness is involved in the read-ing process.  If  you  are  deeply  engaged  in  what  you  are  reading  here,  then  you  are  either entirely unaware of the routine things occurring around you, or you have some awareness for them but you choose not to respond to them because you do not want to be distracted from reading. If someone else is nearby and calls you by name, for example, perhaps you do not hear him or her at all. Or, perhaps, you hear him or her in the 'back of your mind,' but are too involved in reading to respond; you'd rather not divert your attention. And when he or she finally calls you for the fourth time and yells, 'Hey! I'm talking to you!' you may have an awareness that you heard him or her all along!",

        "text": "Just because a person isn't aware of taking in information doesn't mean the person hasn't done so. As a simple example, haven't you found yourself singing some song, only to realize  seconds  later  it's  what's  on  the  radio?  Information  absorbed  at  an  unconscious level can be as powerful as information processed at a conscious level, and often even more so. Simply put, people can take in and respond to information at levels outside of awareness, and hypnosis crystallizes this process. While a client is in hypnosis, his or her conscious mind will naturally wander from thought to thought. He or she may well report having 'lost track' of you and whatever you were saying. During those periods of time that  can  be  long  or  short,  the  client's  unconscious  can  still  take  in  the  clinician's suggestions,  and  is  still  quite  capable  of  responding  to  them.  The  client  might  not remember some or all of the suggestions given (amnesia), yet the suggestions may still exert an influence on him or her. Interestingly, many times my clients will come back, or call, quite some time after our hypnosis session and describe to me 'new' insights and learnings that have caused a beneficial change in their experience of themselves. When\nthey tell me what they've realized, almost word for word it will be things I said to them during our hypnosis session! But for the client, the important learning is experienced as arising 'spontaneously' from within. The sense of personal empowerment as a result is one  of  the  many  benefits  of  hypnosis.  (The  phenomenon  of  guided  learning  at  an unconscious level is an interesting one that represents the larger paradox of psychotherapy: The client is empowered by the therapist empowering him or her.)\nOne's  unconscious  can  process  information  at  a  more  symbolic,  metaphorical  level than  one's  conscious  (Lynn  &  Sivec,  1992;  Watzlawick,  1978).  While  the  conscious mind is occupied with rationally analyzing the words, the unconscious is more concerned with meanings. This is the basis for the multiple level nature of hypnotic communication-using wording and phras-ing of suggestions to appeal on one level to the client's conscious mind by matching its understanding of things, while simultaneously  providing  possibilities  of  new  understandings  to  the  unconscious  mind (Erickson  &  Rossi,  1979,  1981).  The  suggestive  mechanisms  for  doing  so  will  be described in detail in later chapters.",

        "text": "The metaphorical nature of the unconscious mind may be more easily understood when we consider the nature of symptoms. How does a person develop a particular symptom? Why do two different people under similar stresses react with different symptoms? There are many different viewpoints, of course, as to why people develop symptoms. For some, it's  about  genetic  predispositions,  for  some  it's  about  conditioning,  and  for  others  it's about maladaptive or ineffective coping strategies.\nSome clinicians think of symptoms as metaphors for the client's experience (Frederick & Phillips, 1995; Ginandes, 2002). For example, a symbolically oriented therapist might interpret a person's obesity as a protective layer of fat used for deterring unwanted sexual advances,  or  as  a  pattern  of  'swallowing  anger.'  Symptoms  are  thus  viewed  as purposeful and unconscious. Therapy generally takes the form of trying to provide the client  with  insights  about  his  or  her  unconscious  needs  or  motivations  to  maintain  the symptom.  In short, they try to force unconscious information into the client's consciousness to be critically dismantled.\nThis raises an interesting clinical issue: Should the therapist make interpretations about the  presumed unconscious meaning of a client's symptoms? How many different ways can  a  symptom  like  obesity  be  plausibly  interpreted?  The  clinician's  role  is  not necessarily to impose his or her solutions on the client, but rather can be to help the client find  his  or  her  own  solutions.  Realistically,  imposing  one's  values  and  beliefs  on  the client is an inevitable byproduct of the therapeutic relationship, but it is to be minimized, in my opinion, while maximizing respect for that person's integrity.\nUnderstanding  the  unconscious,  metaphorical  nature  of  client  symptoms  leads  to  a different level of appreciation for the makeup of the person, clearly indicating there can be  factors  outside  of  consciousness  that  influence  our  experience.  The  unconscious mind's  contribution to a person's experience highlights the need to be able to communicate with the unconscious; hypnosis is the most effective tool I know of for this purpose. If the symptom is unconscious and metaphorical, why should the treatment only\nbe conscious, rational, and intellectual? It seems apparent, to me at least, that a conscious approach is valuable to some degree and in some contexts, but a style of therapy that also appeals  to  the  unconscious  can  be  of  even  greater  value.  The  empirical  evidence indicating  enhanced  treatment  effects  with  hypnosis  offers  support  to  this  view  (Lynn, Kirsch, Barabasz, Cardeña, & Patterson, 2000).",

        "text": "The  late  psychiatrist  Milton  H.Erickson  was  an  instrumental  force  in  shaping  modern psychotherapy. He evolved a style of treatment that operated on the premise, in part, that if  a  symptom may be metaphorical, so can its treatment be, innovating both direct and indirect  approaches  to  the  use  of  hypnosis  and  psychotherapy  that  were  aimed  at nonconscious aspects of experience (Erickson & Rossi, 1979; Haley, 1973; Zeig, 1980). His  work  continues  to  be  enormously  popular  with  clinicians  for  its  practicality  and ingenuity\nErickson  argued  convincingly  that  the  opportunity  to  communicate  with  the  client's unconscious  mind  in  hypnosis  through  a  variety  of  suggestive  mechanisms  (detailed later)  is  a  more  respectful  approach  to  addressing  his  or  her  needs  without necessarily having  to  confront  directly  his  or  her  conscious  fears  and  limitations.  Furthermore,  he asserted  that  such  communication  is  more  respectful  of  the  client's  personal  integrity because  it  does  not  force  the  clinician's  values  into  the  person's  conscious  mind  by demanding conformity to the clinician's beliefs or theories. Rather, such communication allows the client the opportunity to keep unconscious whatever he or she wishes to, and likewise to make conscious what he or she cares to, and the clinician's responsibility is to utilize  (hence  the  name  'utilization  approach'  for  Erickson's  style  of  intervention)  the client's choices in the process of treatment (Duncan, Miller, & Coleman, 2001; Yapko, 2001; Zeig, 1980, 2001; Zeig & Rennick, 1991). In that sense, Erickson's approach is highly individualized and client-centered.\nOften,  a  client  will  open  up  with  information  from  the  unconscious  at  opportune moments  in  the  therapy  simply  because  the  clinician  has  not  been  demanding  (i.e., threatening the person's defenses), and the client's unconscious has made the choice that he or she is ready to deal with this information. For some, this is where the misconception about  hypnosis  having  the  ability  to  make  people  say  or  do  things  against  their  will comes from; information comes out that the client did not consciously expect to discover or release, yet the client has made a nonconscious choice that 'now is the time and this is the place' to finally unload useless emotional baggage.\nPerhaps this story will illustrate the point I am making. Early in my clinical training in hypnosis, I  worked  with  a  woman  who had come to therapy to quit smoking. Helping someone to stop smoking is not usually a particularly difficult procedure, and is generally the kind of intervention that is brief and superficial in nature. After interviewing her, I began  the  induction  of  hypnosis,  which  went  smoothly.  As  I  began  to  offer  her suggestions  to  help  her  achieve  her  goal,  an  ambulance  happened  to  go  by,  its  siren blaring. For a few moments that seemed an eternity to me, she stopped breathing, her face went white and then red, and her body tensed up everywhere as she began shaking. A moment later, she began crying and screaming hysterically. She'd had the hallucination\nthat her son, who had been killed in the Vietnam War just a few years earlier, was in the ambulance that had gone by. Her emotions were very intense, and bubbling right on the surface. While I was not expecting a session to stop smoking to turn into an intense one of this type, I was well trained to anticipate and deal with this sort of phenomenon, called an  'abreaction,'  as  part  of  my  training.  (Abreactions  will  be  discussed  at  length  in chapter 22). I was acutely aware that this woman had made a choice at some level. She obviously  needed  to  resolve  her  hidden  grief  and  anger  (in  her  view  she'd  had  to  be strong for everyone else), and in this case her smoking apparently became of secondary importance to her.\nUnexpected  as  her  emotional  release  was  given  the  originally  stated  purpose  of  the session,  is  that losing control  or using control? Richard Whiteside, Ph.D., in his book, The  Art  of  Using  and  Losing  Control (1998)  made  the  point  skillfully  that  what superficially  seems  like  a  loss  of  control  can  be  a  therapeutic  opportunity  in  disguise. That  was  certainly  the  case  in  working  with  this  particular  woman.  Certainly,  she  had heard other ambulances in recent years without reacting that way. Why did she react that way at  that  moment  and  in  that  context  if  not  to  use  the  opportunity  to  feel  better,  to grow?\nIn supporting her, guiding her, encouraging her, and helping her gain a perspective on her  loss  and  her  responsibilities  to  herself,  what  started  out  as  a  session  for  stopping smoking became an emotional turning point in her life. She was not out of control, nor was hypnosis forcing her to reveal something against her will. Rather, it was a choice to acknowledge and come to terms with feelings that had been buried along with her young son. How and why she made that choice (was it my age, my name, my height, a phrase I used or some other unconscious association?) is not known, nor was it necessary to know in order to be helpful to her.\nThe larger point is, the client's unconscious mind is capable of making choices, and those  choices  should  be  accepted  and  respected  in  the  course  of  treatment.  Milton Erickson was way ahead of his time in recognizing this point. (Continued on page 161.)",

        "text": "Milton H.Erickson, M.D. (1901-1980), is considered by many to be the most innovative and influential figure in the modern practice of clinical hypnosis and psychotherapy. His unique background, perspectives, and approaches to treatment are of nearly mythic proportion, having become the focal point for recent generations of hypnosis practitioners through the scores of publications and countless workshops teaching variations of his methods.\nDr. Erickson's personal history was remarkable. He was stricken with polio at age 17 and nearly died. Paralyzed and unable to move anything more than his eyelids, he had a lengthy and difficult recovery. He often commented later what a good teacher the polio had been, forcing him to relearn the most basic patterns  of  movement  and  perception.  In  later  life,  he  suffered  post-polio syndrome,  and  eventually  lost  the  use  of  both  his  legs  and  an  arm,  thus\nconfining  him  to  a  wheelchair.  Yet,  his  spirit  was  unbroken,  and  the  many distinguished scholars who came to study with him right up to the very end of his  life  were  awed  by  his  stamina  and  grace  in  the  face  of  intractable  pain from  the  residuals  of  the  polio  (which,  incidentally,  he  managed  with  selfhypnosis).\nDr. Erickson attended the University of Wisconsin, and as an undergraduate was exposed to the work of Clark L.Hull, Ph.D., an extremely influential  experimental  psychologist  and  expert  on  hypnosis.  Dr.  Erickson reacted strongly to the ritualized (i.e., impersonal and inflexible) approaches to  hypnosis  he  saw  Hull  and  others  doing,  independently  evolving  an  evergrowing  awareness  of  individual  differences  between  people  and  ways  to acknowledge and  use  those  individual  differences  in  the  course  of  therapy. Consequently, Dr. Erickson's work has had a widespread appeal to clinicians in particular, who have found his emphasis on the unique attributes of each person a respectful and necessary way of organizing therapeutic interventions with  hypnosis.  Dr.  Erickson  further  popularized  the  use  of  more  natural, conversational approaches to hypnosis which employed indirect methods such as storytelling and paradox. Dr. Erickson's optimistic belief that people had unconscious  resources  that  could  be  organized  and  directed  for  therapeutic purposes has led to a diversity of approaches to and applications of hypnosis that strive to actualize his optimism.\nDr.  Erickson  published  extensively  and  lectured  widely.  Not  all  of  Dr. Erickson's ideas have held up to the rigors of modern scientific inquiry, but a great many of his teachings have proven to be not only clinically effective, but also fundamentally correct. His emphases on achieving\nspecific  treatment  results,  involving  family  members  in  treatment,  and  the necessity of the clinician to be an active agent in creating contexts of change, all  revolutionary  concepts  a  half  century  ago,  are  now  standard  parts  of treatment.  His  use  of  strategic  task  assignments,  often  seemingly  strange  in nature, have also become mainstream as current research evidence affirms the therapeutic benefits of behavioral activation. One literally cannot be a serious student of hypnosis without studying Dr. Erickson's work in detail.\nSo  popular  is  Dr.  Erickson's  work  amongst  clinicians  that  The  Milton H.Erickson Foundation, organized in 1980 by Jeffrey K.Zeig, Ph.D. (see Dr. Zeig's Frame  of  Reference  in  chapter  13),  holds  annual  national and international meetings devoted to Erickson's methods that are consistently the largest  meetings  held  anywhere  in  the  world  on  the  subject  of  hypnosis. Furthermore, the Foundation serves as the 'hub of the wheel' for the more than 100 Milton Erickson Institutes located all over the world, each dedicated to spreading Dr. Erickson's ideas and methods ever farther.\nUnlike nearly all the other distinguished individuals featured in the Frame of Reference sections in this book, Dr. Erickson passed away before I had the\nchance to meet him personally. The following quotes are taken from a variety of sources noted at the end of each quote.\nO n  Empowering Clients: 'Properly  oriented,  hypnotic  therapy  can  give the  patient  that  necessary  understanding  of  his  own  role  in  effecting  his recovery  and  thus  enlist  his  own  effort  and  participation  in  his  own  cure without  giving  him  a  sense  of  dependence  upon  drugs  and  medical  care. Indeed,  hypnosis  offers  the  patient  a  sense  of  comfort  and  an  attitude  of interest  in  his  own  active  participation  in  his  therapy.'  (Erickson,  in  Rossi, 1980, Vol. IV, p. 34)\nO n the Role of the Clinician: 'In hypnosis what you want your patient to do is respond to an idea. It is your task, your responsibility, to learn how to address the patient, how to speak to the patient, how to secure his attention, and how to leave him wide open to the acceptance of an idea that fits into the situation.' (Erickson & Rossi, 1981, p .42)\nO n  Confident  Expectations: 'Every  effort  should  be  made  to  make  the subjects feel comfortable, satisfied, and confident about their ability to go into a  trance,  and  the  hypnotist  should  maintain  an  attitude  of  unshaken  and contagious confidence in the subject's ability. A simple, earnest, unpretentious, confident manner is of paramount importance.' (Erickson, in Rossi, 1980, Vol. IV, p. 18)\nOn Words and Meanings: 'Now, every word in any language has usually a lot of different meanings. Now, the word 'run' has about 142 meanings…the government can run. A run of luck in cards. The girl can run. A run of fish. A run  in  a  lady's  stocking.  A  road  runs  uphill  and  downhill,  and  still  stands still… And so, you ought to be acquainted with the linguistic patterns of your patients.' (Zeig, 1980, p. 78)\nO n  Recognizing  Individual  Differences: 'And  I  do  wish  that  Rogerian therapists, Gestalt therapists, transactional analysts, group analysts, and all the other  offspring  of  various  theories  would  recognize  that  not  one  of  them really recognizes that psychotherapy for person #1 is not psychotherapy for person #2. I've treated many conditions, and I always invent a new treatment in accord with the individual personality.' (Zeig, 1980, p. 104)\nO n Hypnosis and Changing People: 'It  is  hardly reasonable to expect a hypnotized subject, upon the snap of the fingers or the utterance of a simple command, to develop at once significant, complex, and persistent changes in behavioral  functioning.  Rather,  it  is  to  be  expected  that  time  and  effort  are required  to  permit  a  development  of  any  profound  alterations  in  behavior. Such  alteration  must  presumably  arise  from  neuroand  psychophysiological changes  and  processes  within  the  subject,  which  are  basic  to  behavioral manifestations,  and  not  from  the  simple  experience  of  hearing  a  command spoken by a hypnotist.' (Erickson, in Rossi, 1980, Vol. II, p. 50)\nO n  Putting  the  Patient  First: 'You  see,  I  think  the  important  thing  in\nworking with a patient is to do the thing that is going to help the patient. As for my dignity…the hell with my dignity. (Laughs) I will get along all right in this world. I don't have to be dignified, professional. I do the thing that stirs the patient into doing the right thing.' (Zeig, 1980, p. 143)\nO n Getting Clients to Do Strange Task Assignments: 'That is what my family says: 'Why do your patients do the crazy things you tell them to do?' I say,  'I  tell  it  to  them  very  seriously.  They  know  I  mean  it.  I  am  totally sincere. I am absolutely confident that they will do it. I never think, 'Will my patients do that ridiculous thing?' No, I know that they will.' (Zeig, 1980, p. 196)\nO n  Orienting  the  Patient  to  the  Future: 'Insight  into  the  past  may  be somewhat educational. But insight into the past isn't going to change the past. If you were jealous of your mother, it is always going to be a fact\nthat you were jealous of her. If you were unduly fixated on your mother, it is always going to be the fact. You may have insight, but it doesn't change the fact.  Your  patient  has  to  live  in  accord  with  things  of  today.  So  you  orient your  therapy  to  the  patient  living  today  and  tomorrow,  and  hopefully  next week and next year.' (Zeig, 1980, pp. 268-9)\nO n How to Live a Long Life: 'Do you know a good recipe for longevity? … Always  be  sure  to  get  up  in  the  morning.  And  you  can  insure  that  by drinking a lot of water before you go to bed.' (Zeig, 1980, p. 269)\nErickson's influence amongst clinicians has been profound, and many of his ideas have been echoed by clinicians who are prominent in their own right. Paul Watzlawick, Ph.D., is a psychologist long associated with the Mental Research Institute (MRI) of Palo Alto, California, one of the earliest and most influential 'think-tanks' in the world of therapy. The members of MRI have been instrumental in bringing family therapy and strategic therapy  to  life,  and  included  such  luminary  early  members  as  Watzlawick,  Jay  Haley, Virginia  Satir,  Gregory  Bateson,  Richard  Fisch,  John  Weakland,  and  Donald  Jackson. Each of them advocated for the value of hypnosis in their work. In Watzlawick's classic book, The Language of Change (1978), he described eloquently the need to communicate with  the  unconscious  mind  of  the  client  in  order  to  be  as  influential  as  possible  in therapeutically altering his or her experience. Rather than the intellectual, computer-like jargon that appeals to the limited conscious mind of the client, Watzlawick asserted that language  that  is  descriptive,  emotional,  and  appealing  to  the  senses  will  likely  make greater  contact  with  the  client's  powerful  unconscious  resources.  What  about  the  other side of the coin, though? Can hypnosis be used to bypass conscious awareness and leave the client defenseless against the hypnotist's suggestions?",

        "text": "The  fact  that  information  can  be  and  often  is  processed  without  much  conscious awareness is a major factor in the fear many have that destructive or harmful information from the hypnotist is going to get in at an unconscious level and damage the client. Can people  be  negatively  influenced?  Unquestionably.  Yet,  in  general,  the  mind  has  an uncanny ability to protect itself. Every student of psychology, and anyone who has spent some time in the company of other people, learns about the classic defense mechanisms people employ to ward off threats from entering consciousness. The classic defenses such as repression, projection, rationalization, sublimation, and all the others are unconscious coping  mechanisms;  no  one  consciously  says,  'I  can't  accept  responsibility  for  my feelings so I think I'll attribute these feelings to that person over there' (e.g., projection). The defenses are unconscious, and are rooted in the person's need for self-esteem and the desire to avoid internal conflict if at all possible. These defenses are certainly relevant to hypnosis (Fromm, 1992; Nash, 1992).\nThere  is  a  substantial  difference  between  suggestibility  and  gullibility  (T.Barber, 1969).  For  an  individual  who  is  motivated  to  gather  and  weigh  information,  and  to consider the relative merits of what he or she is being told, hypnosis does not preclude the  ability  to  do  so.  For  someone  who  conforms  to  others'  judgments,  even  obviously incorrect ones as we saw were possible in the last chapter, hypnosis will not amplify the willingness or need to do so. Each person is as psychologically safe as he or she wants and  needs  to  be.  If  someone  wants  to  reject  suggestions,  no  matter  how  deeply  in hypnosis  he  or  she  might  be,  the  ability  to  do  so  is  retained  (Lynn,  Rhue,  &  Weekes, 1990). The defenses someone can employ are both conscious and unconscious, and so even suggestions that escape conscious scrutiny will still encounter unconscious defenses.  When,  if  ever,  is  hypnosis  potentially  hazardous?  When  someone  credible intentionally or unintentionally feeds misinformation to an individual who has no ready means for evaluating the merits of what they're being told. This is a primary reason why I advocate hypnosis be done permissively, encouraging expanding the range of empowering  choices  in  client  experience  rather  than  demanding  mere  compliance. Hypnotic hazards and ethical guidelines for using hypnosis are discussed throughout this book, but are the special focus of chapter 22.\nAs a final point about this issue of the mind's ability to protect itself, it seems to me that  if  there  were  a  group  of  powerful  humans  called  'hypnotists'  who  could  control others  through  manipulation  of  the  unconscious  mind,  hypnosis  would  be  a  uniformly successful tool in practice. It isn't.",

        "text": "Conflicting  views  about  the  nature  of  the  unconscious  mind,  including  its  abilities  to manage  conflicting  information  (McConkey,  1991;  Sheehan  &  Grigg,  1985),  generate entirely nonvolitional responses (Lynn et al., 1990), retrieve accurate details of forgotten historical  events  (Sheehan,  1995),  alter  physiology  and  cure  some  diseases  (Phillips,\n2000; Rossi, 2002), tap latent creativity (Lynn & Sivec, 1992; Shames & Bowers, 1992), and  resolve  and  manage  various  psychological  problems  (Crasilneck  &  Hall,  1985; Kroger, 1977; Rossi, 1980) have been a part of the field from the very beginning. As the field grows  in  depth  and  sophistication, some  questions  about  hypnosis  and  the unconscious get answered, and as they do, many more new ones evolve as a result.\nWith such a large and ever growing body of good evidence that hypnosis is helpful in so many types of problems, there has been a growing but noncritical acceptance of the admittedly  attractive  belief  that  any  problem  can  be  solved,  any  condition  or  disease cured,  if  the  'healing  powers  of  the  unconscious'  are  appropriately  tapped.  Many advocates of hypnosis have made some rather extreme statements out of their enthusiasm for  hypnosis.  Most  of  these  tout  the  'wonders'  and  'unlimited  capabilities'  of  the unconscious  mind,  suggesting  that  being  in  hypnosis  and  receiving  the  appropriate suggestions will almost magically resolve nearly every problem. They tell stories to their clients during hypnosis and tell them to 'trust your unconscious' to derive the therapeutic meaning; they offer suggestions and tell clients to 'trust your unconscious' to integrate them; and they tell clients to be patient in allowing therapeutic progress because they can 'trust your unconscious' to know when the best time will be to change, and on and on. If only it were the case that all you have to do is offer a sensible suggestion to someone's unconscious and then sit back to wait while his or her unconscious mind magically takes it in and puts it to work. Life as a clinician would be so much easier, if that were the case.\nThe  philosophy  of  a  powerful  and  benevolent  unconscious  is  appealing  for  many reasons. It's nice to think that each person has a core of health and power. It's nice to think our fundamental nature is positive and goal-directed. It's encouraging to think we know  at  some  deep  nonverbal  level  what  is  right  and  that  we  should  just  trust  our intuition.  It's  reassuring  to  believe  that  when  we  get  sick  with  even  life-threatening diseases that we can find the cure inside that's just waiting to be let loose.\nThe  belief  in  an  all-powerful  unconscious  inspires  an  optimism  in  people  they  find spiritually satisfying in the same way they love the motivational speakers who tell us we can 'have it all.' Well, we can have a lot, but…no, you can't have it all. Why? Simply because every choice precludes other choices. If you choose to sit and read this hypnosis text, it means you're not at the movies right now.\nThe 'unconscious' is a global construct psychologists use to talk about parts of human functioning that take place beyond conscious awareness. It's an abstraction, a shorthand. There  isn't  really  a  well  defined  entity  called  'the'  unconscious  that  we  can  say predictably and reliably does this or that. Instead, we infer principles of its functioning from  experimentation  and  observation.  We  learn  that  the  unconscious  has  some  very impressive resources and potentials. And, we learn that unconscious minds make some pretty  serious  mistakes,  enough  to  warrant  skepticism  about  those  approaches  that encourage people to simply 'trust your unconscious.' One can still be enthusiastic about hypnosis,  as  I  obviously  am,  without  overstating  what  hypnosis  can  do  or,  more accurately, what the unconscious can do through hypnosis. The impressive results speak for  themselves,  but  the  belief  that  anyone  can  achieve  similar  results  is  potentially misleading.",

        "text": "Can anyone be hypnotized? The complex issue of who can be hypnotized (and, likewise, who cannot) has been researched and written about at great length by some of the most respected  people  in  the  field.  The  net  result  is  the  conclusion  that  although  the  great majority  of  people  can  experience  hypnosis  to  some  degree,  not  everyone  is  equally responsive  to  hypnosis  (E.  Hilgard,  1965;  Weitzenhoffer,  2000).  Research  subjects exposed to standardized and different forms of hypnotic induction and offered standardized  and  differing  suggestions  show  variable  levels  of  responsiveness  across conditions (Spiegel & Spiegel, 1987; Lynn, Neufeld, & Matyi, 1987). Thus, many experts conclude that hypnotizability, generally defined in the research as an ability to respond positively  to  suggested  experiences,  is  substantially  more  about  personal  factors  than interpersonal or contextual ones. In this chapter, we  will explore some  of the characteristics  of  the  individual  (the  intrapersonal  factors)  that  may  influence  hypnotic responsiveness.\nResearch  into  the  capacity  to  experience  hypnosis  has  examined  many  different personal  variables  including  personality  types  (T.  Barber,  1964;  Malinoski  &  Lynn, 1999),  imaginative  ability  and  fantasy  proneness  (J.  Hilgard,  1979;  Wilson  &  Barber, 1981, 1983), capacity for absorption (Roche & McConkey, 1990; Council & Huff, 1990), expectancy  (Kirsch,  2000),  gender  (Weitzenhoffer,  2000),  age  (Morgan  &  E.Hilgard, 1973), and many other factors.\nThe hypnotic responsiveness issue was first touched on in chapter 2, specifically in the discussion of the misconception that 'only certain kinds of people can be hypnotized.' Despite the growing body of research evidence that level of hypnotizability is a variable trait across individuals, but a stable trait within individuals over time (E.Hilgard, 1965; Piccione,  E.  Hilgard,  &  Zimbardo,  1989),  many  hypnosis  experts  in  actual  clinical practice  prefer  to  focus  on  maximizing  client  responsiveness  rather  than  assessing hypnotizability Instead, they operate on the premise that hypnotizability, when assessed through  a  standardized  instrument  of  some  sort,  misses  the  synergistic  qualities  of therapeutic  interaction  that  can  enhance  responsiveness  (Geary,  2001).  Later  in  this chapter I will consider the notion of enhancing hypnotic responsiveness in individuals. Before doing so, let's explore the literature on intrapersonal factors affecting hypnotizability.",

Test  scores  from  personality  inventories  such  as  the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Thurstone Personality Schedule,\nthe  Rorschach,  the  Thematic  Apperception  Test  (TAT),  the  California  Psychological Inventory (CPI), and many other standardized personality measures have all been studied relative to hypnotizability as measured by standardized tests and all have yielded similar results:  No  specific  positive  correlations  exist  between  hypnotic  responsiveness  and scores  on  these  assessment  instruments  (Kirsch  &  Council,  1992).  In  one  recent  study (Nordenstrom,  Council,  &  Meier,  2002),  the  'Five  Factor'  model  for  describing individual differences in personality (Costa & McCrae, 1997) was studied in regards to hypnotizability. The  five factors include openness,  conscientiousness, neuroticism, agreeableness,  and  extraversion.  And,  once  again,  no  meaningful  relationships  were found to exist between hypnotic responsiveness and these personality characteristics.",

        "text": "Josephine  Hilgard,  Ph.D.,  in  her  1970  book, Personality  and  Hypnosis:  A  Study  of Imaginative Involvement, asserted that hypnotizability was best predicted by the capacity for imaginative  involvement,  which  she  defined  as  the capacity for nearly total immersion in some activity to the exclusion of irrelevant competing stimuli. She clearly advocated for the perceptual process of selective attention, but added in the extra element in her formulation of being selectively focused on or immersed in imaginary experience. Perhaps surprisingly, the research for this view has been equivocal, however, that may be because of the broad range of imaginative abilities in human populations.\nPeople vary in their  abilities  and  styles  for  processing  information;  some  people  are quite concrete (i.e., tied to the immediacy of their experience), not very imaginative, and require  highly  detailed  descriptions  of  experience  they  have  already  had  in  order  to experience hypnosis. Others are capable of high level abstraction (i.e., having experiences  that  are  not  part  of  past  or  present  experience)  in  which  imagination  and fantasy can run loose in their minds and generate meaningful experiences for them. How concrete or abstract someone is in their thinking is a factor in responsiveness to hypnosis because of the subjective nature of the hypnotic experience. There are no rockets that go off, no sirens that sound, no marching bands that come by waving banners that confirm 'this is hypnosis!' The experience of hypnosis can range from being a subtle one, barely distinguishable  from  one's  normal  waking  state,  or  it  can  be  a  very  profound,  distinct experience  characterized  by  certain  intense  sensations  and  perceptions  collectively identified as 'hypnosis.' To the concrete and unimaginative individual experiencing the subtleties of a lightly hypnotic experience, the reaction is often 'I wasn't hypnotized… I heard  everything  you  said.'  The  concrete  subject  should  generally  be  spoken  to  in parallel concrete terms of verifiable experience. Using abstract terms such as a person's 'energy flow,'  or  people's  'essence,'  or  their  'groundedness,'  or  'letting  your  energy flow  unrestricted  in  order  to  achieve  a  harmony  with  the  universe,'  and  other  such nondescript abstractions is likely to result in a cosmic failure. Some people's imaginative powers are very concrete, others' are more abstract. This is one more variable to consider in formulating one's approach.\nBuilding  on  the  research  regarding  imaginative  involvement,  the  'fantasy-prone' individual  was  'discovered'  by  Theodore  X.Barber  and  Sheryl  Wilson  (Barber,  2000)\nwhen  studying  highly  responsive  individuals.  These  are  commonly  known  in  the hypnosis  research  as  the  'highs,'  while  others  still  use  the  older  Ernest  Hilgard  label, 'virtuosos' (E.Hilgard, 1977), to describe such highly responsive individuals.\nRecently,  Barber  reviewed  the  development  of  and  evidence  for  the  fantasy-prone 'high' (2000) as a strong factor in his multifactor model of hypnotizability, reviewed in chapter 3. Fantasy-prone individuals are described as those who become immersed in a private  and  highly  subjective  world  of  daydreams  and  fantasy,  and  even  paranormal experiences.",

Tellegen  and  Atkinson  (1974)  described  absorption  as  'an  openness  to  self  altering experiences,' and devised an instrument called the Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS) to measure  one's  quality  of  absorption.  The  34-item  TAS  questionnaire  is  a  widely  used measure of absorption, and it has, in fact, predicted hypnotic responsiveness in research subjects  to  a  significant  degree  (Council  &  Huff,  1990;  Radtke  &  Stam,  1991).  An interesting finding, though, is that the TAS has only a modest correlation with established hypnotizability scales (described in chapter 11). Whatever ways that might be interpreted, fostering absorption in doing hypnosis benefits the process.",

        "text": "The role of expectancy in shaping responsiveness to hypnosis, psychotherapy, medicine, and life experience has been discussed previously. Psychologist Irving Kirsch, Ph.D., has studied  expectancy  in  depth,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  hypnotic  responsiveness, evolving his 'response set theory' in the process (Kirsch, 2000). In it, he assimilates a wide variety of research supporting the notion that a person's expectations about his or her ability to respond to suggestions mediates his or her eventual experience. He said,\nSuggestions are statements that (are) explicitly aimed at eliciting the expectation of a change in experience and behavior. This is particularly clear with respect to direct suggestions, such as 'your arm is getting lighter,' 'your arm is becoming numb,' and 'you will forget everything that has happened during this session.' To  accept  a  suggestion  is  to  believe  or  expect  that  these  events  will,  in  fact, happen. (Kirsch, 2000, p. 279)\nKirsch goes even further, suggesting these expectations can lead individuals to develop responses  that  others  call  a  manifestation  of  hypnosis  without  the  necessity  of  any hypnotic induction. Kirsch wrote: 'There are good experimental data indicating that for the most part, hypnotic responses reflect genuine changes in experience… However, the experiential  and  physiological  changes  produced  by  hypnosis  do  not  require  that  the person be in a trance' (Kirsch, 2000, p. 278). Expectancy is an especially strong factor mediating  hypnotic  responsiveness.  I  would  suggest,  and  have  suggested  in  previous writings  (Yapko,  1988,  1989,  1993,  2001),  that  imparting  positive  expectations  to  the\nclient  represents  the  single  best  focal  point  for  doing  hypnosis  and  the  most  important initial target of therapeutic intervention.",

        "text": "Early  studies  done  addressing  the  issue  of  whether  there  are  gender  differences  in hypnotizability yielded some data to support the belief that, in general, women may be slightly  more  hypnotizable  than  men  (E.Hilgard,  1965).  Subsequently,  any  gender differences  in  hypnosis  have  not  held  up  over  time.  Weitzenhoffer  summarized  his findings on the subject this way:\n(The  difference)  between  men  and  women  has  been  equivocal.  That  is,  in general there has been a consistent small difference found favoring women over men,  but  never  at  even  the  5%  level  of  significance.  This  has  led  past researchers to reject the existence of a difference… The difference is much too small  to  be  of  practical  importance  or  to  indicate  something  that  would  be theoretically important. (2000, p. 281)\nDespite the lack of difference in hypnotizability based on gender in a general sense, there is  certainly good reason to take gender into account given the substantial data showing different rates of vulnerability, differential courses, and differential responses to treatments in a variety of  conditions (Waalen,  1997).  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a growing emphasis on acknowledging and incorporating gender differences into hypnotic procedures. Women's issues in particular have received a growing attention within the field (Hornyak, 1999; Linden, 1995, 1997, 1999). These have been catalyzed, in part, by the exceptional contributions of one of the most skilled, forceful, and important figures in the evolution of the field, Kay Thompson, D.D.S.

        "text": "Kay  Thompson,  D.D.S.  (1930-1998)  was  an  extraordinary  woman  and  an inspiring  contributor  to  the  field  of  hypnosis.  Dr.  Thompson  graduated  in 1953 as the only woman in her class from her dental school, the University of Pittsburgh. Years later she was the first woman to be elected president of the Pennsylvania Dental Association in its 120-year history.\nShortly  after  graduating  from  dental  school,  Dr.  Thompson  received  a brochure  in  the  mail  advertising  a  course  in  hypnosis.  She  attended  the training  out  of  curiosity,  and  so  began  her  lifelong  fascination  with  and appreciation of clinical hypnosis. Just a few years later, in 1957, the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis (ASCH) was formed by Dr. William Kroger and Dr. Milton Erickson, and Dr. Thompson joined and continued her training and professional  development  through  ASCH.  She  was  especially  close  to  Dr. Erickson, and once said that, 'He had more influence on me than anyone but the  woman  who  gave  birth  to  me.'  Theirs  was  a  creative  and  fruitful\nprofessional  collaboration  over  the  years.  She  soon  became  an  instrumental teacher in ASCH, and was recognized nationally and internationally for her skill, clinical  acumen,  sensitivity,  and  creativity.  Eventually,  she  served ASCH as its president, its first female president, and was a recipient of the highest  awards  offered  by  ASCH  as  well  as  the  other  major  professional hypnosis society in the United States, The Society for Clinical and Experimental  Hypnosis.  Generous  in  sharing  her  advanced  knowledge  and skills, Dr. Thompson mentored young\ndental  students  and  also  donated  time  to  provide  dental  services  at  a residential facility for physically and mentally handicapped adults. She was a role model for everyone, but being the first woman in positions of power and authority  allowed  her  to  be  an  especially  important  role  model  for  women everywhere, a fact Dr. Thompson was well aware of and took very seriously.\nDr. Thompson lectured all over the world on the intricacies of the language patterns of hypnosis, continually emphasizing  the  importance  of  using language deliberately and with an awareness that meanings are in people and not the words themselves. She also spoke regularly about pain control and the use of hypnosis in dentistry and other physical procedures where managing pain was desirable and necessary. She was creative in her work and her use of hypnosis, and was a co-inventor of one of the most interesting approaches to hypnosis, an overloading technique known as the 'dual induction.' The dual induction is a process involving two people performing hypnosis simultaneously on a single client.\nDr.  Thompson  loved  elephants  and  collected  elephant  statues,  elephant pictures,  elephant anything .  When  I  had  the  unique  and  life-transforming experience  of  working  on  an  elephant-breeding  program  at  the  San  Diego Wild Animal Park, applying some of my skill-building strategies with trainers and keepers, I got  to  know  many  elephants  firsthand  through  daily  contact. Dr. Thompson was mesmerized by some of the stories of elephant behavior I shared with her. It seemed a too small gift to give back to her, though, for all the times she had mesmerized me with her skills, knowledge, and humanism.\nO n Becoming a Dentist: 'I grew up an only child in the only professional family  in  the  community-my  father  was  a  dentist.  My  father  was  always there to help others, and I saw it as a very caring profession. And no one told me I couldn't be a dentist! I have always had a strong work ethic and a huge sense of responsibility.'*\nO n  Learning  Hypnosis: 'Somehow  I  attracted  all  the  frightened  and phobic patients. I got a brochure on hypnosis, and went to the course looking for some 'magic' for dealing with difficult patients, and I've been involved with hypnosis ever since… I think there are two kinds of people who work with hypnosis: the people who are truly interested in using it as a modality to help their patients or their clients, and the other people who get into it because\nof the need for self-aggrandizement.'*\nO n  Meeting  Erickson: 'I met  Erickson  in  October,  1953.  Erickson terrified  me!  I  was  fascinated  but  terrified  by  anybody  who  could  see  into your soul like that. He demonstrated that ability with every demonstration\ntion he did. I used to try to hide when it was deep trance demonstration time, but there were many times I had to 'volunteer.' I worked very closely with him until his death.'*\nO n  Hypnotic  Interventions  in  Medicine  and  Dentistry: 'Dental  and medical  procedures  are  more  physiologically  invasive  than  psychotherapy, and we have less time to help patients resolve their issues about what we are going to do with them and to them. So we have to do brief therapy if we do any  therapy…  Hypnosis  is  too  important  a  tool  to  be  limited  to  the  pure therapeutic  aspect.  There  are  so  many  physiological  benefits  that  can  be obtained with it.'**\nO n Tailoring Interventions to the Individual: 'I  always emphasize that inductions  cannot  be  a  recipe. Each  induction  must  be  individualized. Certainly a dual induction cannot be either another's words or a script. I have seen  experienced  people  read  an  induction  and  I  don't  understand  why. Subjects always sense if an induction is not for them. That is something that Erickson certainly stressed, and so do I.'**\nA dvice  on  Developing  Skills  in  Hypnosis: 'Practice,  practice,  practice basic,  formal  induction  techniques.  Practice,  practice,  practice.  Observe, observe, observe. Learn to go from formal structured techniques where you learn to observe, and slide into the utilization of metaphor…. It takes a long time-years and years of putting things into your unconscious in order to be able  to  rely  upon  it  to  be  spontaneous…  Learn  to  improve,  improve  by learning…  You  can't  always  know  what  to  expect,  but  you  can  learn  to handle the unexpected.'**\nSources: *Personal communication; December 8, 1988 **Interview with Betty Alice Erickson published in The Milton H.Erickson Foundation Newsletter, Spring 1994\nAcknowledging  gender  differences  between  men  and  women  may  well  influence  the quality of your communications with different clients. Language choices, the quality of your demeanor, and the emphasis you place on particular concepts or awarenesses you hope to impart can be well tailored to your client. Certainly people are more than their gender,  but  gender  is  undeniably  a  factor  shaping  perceptions  and  so  should  be considered in treatment planning.",

        "text": "Does an individual's age influence his or her responsiveness to hypnosis? The answer is, in a general sense of course, yes. In particular, the issue of age and hypnosis has revolved around the differences in  responsiveness between children and adults. Research in this domain has typically  examined hypnotic  responsiveness  in  children  using  standardized test items of hypnotic responsiveness adapted to children's developmental stage (Cooper & London, 1966, 1976, 1979). Since the test items are much the same as for adults, it becomes possible to characterize hypnotic responsiveness over the course of a lifetime (Cooper & London, 1971).\nThe available evidence suggests that responsiveness to hypnosis emerges at a low level around age 5, rises sharply to a peak responsiveness around ages 7 to 9, begins a gradual decline in early adolescence, and stays fairly level throughout adulthood (J.Hilgard, 1979; Morgan & E.Hilgard, 1973).\nChildren  are,  in  general,  responsive  to  hypnosis,  but  naturally  require  different approaches  than  adults do (Vandenberg,  2002).  After  all, the range of personal experiences is considerably more limited, and both cognitive and social abilities are less well developed. As a counterbalance, though, children also tend to have less rigid notions of  reality,  a  greater  capacity  for  play,  including  role  play,  and  a  higher  level  of responsiveness to authorities.\nOne  of  the  most  common  reasons  why  some  practitioners  come  to  question  the responsiveness of children to hypnosis is because of the active nature of most children. As will be discussed in the next chapter, adults generally inhibit voluntary activity when in  hypnosis,  a  phenomenon  associated  with  hypnosis  called  'catalepsy.'  In  contrast, children  often  fidget  and  outwardly  appear  restless  even  though  they  may  be  very involved with the clinician and what he or she is doing (Olness & Kohen, 1996). If one has an inflexible expectation of how a client in hypnosis must look and behave, a fidgety child  will  seem  unaffected  by  hypnotic  procedures.  Sometimes,  perhaps  much  of  the time,  a  procedure  with  children  can  encourage  and  make  use  of  the  child's  energy  by engaging  him  in  some  activity  (e.g.,  a  game)  that  distracts  him  or  her  from  what  the clinician  intends  to  communicate.  (As  you  have  previously  learned,  suggestions  can engender meaningful responses even when they are not one's principal focal point.)\nObservation of the child's interactions with his parents and siblings can provide a great deal of useful information about the kind of relationship (i.e., friend, ally, teacher, doctor) one may build with him or her in order to best influence him or her (Olness & Kohen, 1996). Knowledge of his interests and emotional needs will also help one discover the best avenue of intervention. An exceptionally creative example of an engaging approach to  a  child's  problem  is  one  of  Milton  Erickson's  cases,  described  by  Jay  Haley  in Uncommon  Therapy (1973).  A  young  boy  with  the  problem  of  enuresis  was  literally dragged in by his parents to see Dr. Erickson. Alone with the child in his office, Erickson angrily complained aloud about the audacity of the boy's parents. How dare they order him to cure the boy's enuresis! Erickson went on complaining about the parents for quite some time, and meanwhile the boy was entranced by this strange doctor's  unexpected rants against his parents, whom, not coincidentally, he was pretty angry with, too. When Erickson finally said he'd prefer not to deal with the boy's bedwetting at all, he shifted\ntheir 'conversation' to talking about the muscle coordination necessary for the sport of archery,  an  interest  of  the  boy's.  By  talking  at  length  about  growing  up  and  the development of muscle control, Erickson was able to indirectly offer suggestions for the boy establishing  control  of  his  bladder  muscles.  Erickson's  unusual  intervention  was  a successful one, and it began by utilizing the boy's anger, first forming an alliance with him against his parents, or so it seemed, and then using the alliance to teach something the boy wanted to learn that was a perfect parallel to solving his problem. Such a case example  illustrates  points  made  earlier  about  using  states  of  absorption  to  build  new associations within the client, even  associations not immediately  in  the  person's awareness.\nIn general, age is a relatively minor consideration in assessing the capacity to respond hypnotically. Age is a factor to consider, though, in determining an effective approach for the induction and utilization that is appropriate to the age and background of the client.",

        "text": "Every  person  has  a  self-esteem,  a  value  they  place  on  themselves  in  terms  of  their perceived self-worth. The self-esteem of a person can range from very low to very high. Self-esteem is not necessarily a stable trait that remains fixed throughout one's lifetime; rather it can go up or down with experience. Yet, self-esteem is self-regulating in that it can  unintentionally  motivate  one  to  work  very  hard  at  staying  the  same  in  many important ways.  If  a  person  has  a  poor  self-esteem,  he  or  she  is  unlikely  to  take  even small  risks  in  his  or  her  own  behalf.  New  opportunities  to  grow,  perhaps  by  leaving behind people and situations long outgrown, may be ignored. For example, a person may be unhappy with a certain life situation, but at the same time feel fearful and uncertain about  changing  it,  and  thus  be  immobilized.  The  person  with  a  higher  self-esteem,  by contrast, is better able to take sensible risks, trusting him- or herself enough to manage new situations and opportunities appropriately.\nThe self-esteem of the client is a significant variable in his or her ability to respond meaningfully  to  the  clinician's  suggestions.  Self-esteem,  in  part,  determines  what  one views as possible for oneself. The little boy who says, 'Mommy, I can't do math,' is not likely  to  be  reassured  by  a  simple,  'Oh,  sure  you  can.'  It  creates  dissonance  between Mom's feedback and the boy's self-image.\nIf you  consider the typical cigarette smoker  as  another example  of  cognitive dissonance  (Festinger,  1957),  you  find  that  the  smoker  may  view  him-or  herself  as intelligent, sensitive, rational, and as having other positive intellectual qualities as well. If you  ask  this  intelligent,  sensitive,  rational  person  why  he  or  she  inhales  toxic  gases voluntarily at great risk to his or her health, the reaction is likely to be defensive, perhaps even  angry.  You  have  posed  a  question  that  brings  his  or  her  irrational  actions  into awareness, suggesting that his or her way of managing him- or herself is not an entirely sensible one. A  typical response to the contradictory feedback you provide is rationalization: 'I only smoke a few each day…. I'd rather smoke than be overweight (as if they are a tradeoff)…. I plan on quitting as soon as the stress I'm under eases up….' The rationalizations are virtually endless in an attempt to maintain the belief that 'I'm smart even though I smoke.'",

        "text": "The point of cognitive dissonance and its importance for hypnotic communication is that information contradictory to what the person believes to be true is defended against through  a  variety  of  means  in  order  to  maintain  the  original  belief.  A  person  with  a terrible  self-image  who is told,  'You have so much to offer,' is not likely to take that message in. The real skill of hypnotic communication is in knowing how to package a communication for someone in such a way as to maximize its likelihood of becoming internalized.\nSelf-image is directly related to how much control a person feels the need to have at all times. Control as an issue for some people was discussed previously as a factor affecting your work with hypnosis. If a client is terrified of losing control, then a formal, ritualized approach to hypnosis that emphasizes the need to respond obediently will be marginally successful at best. Conversely, if a client's self-image is a strong one and there is selftrust, the client can be comfortable that no one can do anything to him or her. For such people, control is not a significant issue. Such people are confident they can respond as they wish.\nSelf-esteem  is  an  entirely  learned  phenomenon,  not  a  trait  present  at  birth.  Your experiences  and,  more  important,  the  conclusions  you  draw  from  those  experiences, determine how you will view yourself. Confronting a client's self-image directly in the form of contradicting it is rarely a  successful  maneuver  for  changing it.  Typically,  the client just gets the feeling the clinician really doesn't understand him or her.",

        "text": "There have been numerous studies attempting to determine whether there is a relationship between  hypnotizability  and  the  development  of  specific  clinical  disorders.  Using standardized measures of hypnotic responsiveness, higher levels of hypnotizability have been  associated  with  phobias  (Frankel,  1974,  1976),  post-traumatic  stress  disorder (Spiegel, Hunt, & Dondershine, 1988), dissociative identity disorders (Bliss, 1986), sleep disturbances featuring nightmares (Belicki & Belicki, 1986), and eating disorders (Nash &  Baker,  1993;  Pettinati,  Horne,  &  Staats,  1985)  to  name  just  a  few.  An  increased responsiveness  to  suggestion,  a  greater  capacity  for  dissociation,  a  deeper  quality  of experiential absorption-any or all of these and other factors, too, may combine to serve as a foundation for various disorders. The  parallel notions of a 'negative selfhypnosis'  (Araoz,  1985)  or  a  'symptomatic  hypnosis'  (Gilligan,  1987)  have  been valuable in underscoring the point made earlier that hypnosis is a neutral phenomenon, capable  of  generating  a  broad  range  of  experiences,  deemed  either  helpful  or  harmful depending on their outcome.\nWhen  hypnotizability  can  be  associated  (correlationally,  not  causally)  with  various disorders,  does  that  mean  you  shouldn't  do  hypnosis  with  people  suffering  those disorders?  The  answer  is  unambiguous:  You  can  do  hypnosis  with  any  category  of disorder,  but  each  category  requires  its  own  specialized  approaches.  For  example,  the approach you would use with someone who is highly dependent and other-oriented would differ  from  the  approach  you'd use with someone socially avoidant and inner-directed. More to the point, though, we treat people, not diagnostic categories . Some of the most limiting  myths about hypnosis involve the 'dangers' of doing hypnosis with particular\nclinical populations. In fact, much of my professional focus has been on the disorder of depression, a disorder for which hypnosis was taught for decades to be contraindicated. In my 1992 book, Hypnosis and the Treatment of Depressions, to my knowledge the very first book on the subject of applying hypnosis in the treatment of depressed individuals, I described at length the myths (such as that hypnosis would 'strip' peoples' defenses and leave them suicidal), where they came from, and why they were myths in light of recent data.\nI had also been taught that psychotic persons cannot be hypnotized. It is claimed they are unable to attend to the hypnotist's guidance due to their hallucinations, delusions, and confusion.  Some  psychiatrists  have  even  said  they  are  likely  to  rediagnose  someone labeled psychotic if the person is found to be hypnotizable. There are others, though, who have  described  good  clinical  work  involving  hypnosis  with  psychotic  patients  (Baker, 1983; Brown, 1985; Murray-Jobsis, 1993; Rossi, 1980). When one teaches such disturbed patients  formal,  concrete  relaxation  procedures,  makes  contact  with  their  idiosyncratic views, addresses any manipulative aspect there might be to the psychotic's behavior and removes  the  payoffs  when  possible,  and  metaphorically  intervenes,  psychotic  patients may well improve.\nOf course, the degree of psychosis is a variable to consider. I doubt a bipolar patient in peak  manic  phase,  for  example,  can  be  affected  by  a  good  hypnotic  suggestion  or anything else verbal. The cause of the person's psychosis is an important factor as well. Drug-induced psychosis is difficult to overcome, as is psychosis associated with aging. Senility, though, depending on its degree, may not preclude hypnotic approaches. Many older  patients  suffering  senile  dementia  can't  remember  what  they  were  doing  five minutes ago, but can remember with remarkable clarity things that occurred 50 years ago. Regressive techniques to early experiences can have a calming, soothing effect for them. Likewise,  providing  basic  care  of  these  and  other  psychotic  patients,  such  as  routine bathing  and  dressing,  can  have  very  positive  effects  when  calming  and  supportive suggestions are simultaneously employed.\nThe mental status of the individual is obviously a pervasive factor influencing whether and how he or she will relate to you and your suggestions. As long as the focus stays on any given person's strengths and limitations rather than his or her diagnosis, the potential to help someone exists. This all-important point will be brought to life in a powerful way when when you experience Vicki, the terminal cancer patient in chapter 20, who got lost behind her labels. It cost her her life.",

        "text": "After  all  the  research  unsuccessfully  attempting  to  relate  single  factors  of  personality, age, or whatever, with hypnotizability, it becomes clear that hypnotic responsiveness is a function  of  multiple  factors  operating  together  in  some  way.  Woody,  Bowers,  and Oakman  (1992)  described three possible models of performance that involve a multifactor explanation.  They  are  additive,  synergistic,  and disjunctive models  of performance, and each has different implications for explaining performance in hypnosis. They wrote:\nIt  is  the  additive  model  that  is  generally  presumed.  This  model  suggests  that social-psychological  and  special-trait  effects  are  in  principle  separable,  but  in practice, on hypnosis scales, simultaneously coexisting. By  contrast, the synergistic model would suggest that the essence of hypnotic performance may inhere in the holistic combination of the two kinds of mechanisms. Finally, the disjunctive model would suggest that a substantial proportion of subjects…can enact a given suggestion in either a social-psychological fashion or a dissociative one, depending, presumably, on situational factors…. Unfortunately, just as scores on a hypnosis scale do not specify the underlying mechanisms that produced them, neither do they allow us to track down how these mechanisms work together. (p. 19)\nDespite  the  inability  to  tease  out  which  hypothetical  factors  within  someone  create hypnotic responsiveness, the theories abound. Fred Evans (2000) proposed a multifactorial  model  of  hypnotic  behavior  that  emphasized  a  'complex  mix'  of  four factors: expectations, suggestion, a cognitive component (including relaxation, imagery, and 'trance logic'-the  ability to withstand inconsistencies in information), and dissociation (described by Evans as a function of selective attention). Theodore X.Barber (2000) proposed the four-factor model described in detail in chapter 3.\nTest-retest  studies  of  hypnotizability  show  a  high  correlation,  suggesting  it  is  a relatively stable phenomenon  over  time.  This  has  led  many  experts  to  consider responsiveness to hypnosis as a personality trait comparable to other personality traits. In their  view,  it  is  unclear  whether  one  is  born  with  a  high,  low,  or  absent  'hypnotic susceptibility' gene structure, or whether this trait is acquired as a learned phenomenon through the socialization process. Regardless, in this view the presence or absence of the hypnotizability trait is a condition that remains relatively stable over time. In other words, if  a  person lacks responsiveness to a formal hypnosis induction procedure, he or she is deemed  a  poor  subject,  a  'low.'  Further  research  studies  on  the  reliability  of  this conclusion support it: Poor subjects seem to remain poor over time (in repeated attempts to  induce  hypnosis in the same person with the same or similar procedures), and good subjects seem to remain good over time. Is hypnotic responsiveness a fixed capacity, or can someone's responsiveness to hypnosis be enhanced?",

        "text": "A practical concern of the clinician is how to maximize the client's responsiveness to the treatment.  If  responsiveness  is  viewed  as  innate  to  the  client,  then  there  is  no  need  to experiment with different suggestion structures and styles. Either the client has 'it,' or he or she doesn't. Similarly, in manualizing treatments, either the technique 'works,' or it doesn't. Clinicians are generally highly skeptical, though, not easily persuaded that what they  do  is  either  reduceable  to  a  ritualized  treatment  or  irrelevant  to  how  the  client responds.  Consequently,  the  motivation  has  existed  on  the  part  of  many  clinicians  and researchers to go beyond the data declaring hypnotizability a fixed trait in an effort to explore ways of enhancing responsiveness.\nResearch demands standardization. Every research subject, regardless of whether it is in research on hypnosis or research in some other area, must experience the exact same procedure in order for a study to be considered scientific (i.e., controlled, replicable). In standardizing  hypnotic  inductions,  the  process  must  be  the  same:  The  timing,  the hypnotist's voice dynamics,  the degree of formality of the relationship between researcher  and  subject,  the  recording  of  responses  to  the  procedure,  the  place,  the lighting, and virtually every other variable must be carefully controlled. Consequently, a large number of research subjects are exposed to the same hypnosis procedure, then are given  a  test  to  determine  their  degree  of  responsiveness.  The  resulting  statistics  are published as evidence of the degree of hypnotizability of the general population of which the research population is a sample.\nThe standardization of techniques in order to promote a scientific hypnosis is a doubleedged sword. On the one hand, a deeper, more scientific understanding of hypnosis is desirable if we are to better understand its mechanisms and range of applications. On the other  hand,  summarizing  clients  as  a  'low,'  'medium,'  or  'high'  (or  some  diagnostic label) reduces the ability of the clinician to notice and respond to the uniqueness of each person. Hypnosis, like therapy, will never be only science. It will always involve art (i.e., clinical judgment, creativity, and flexibility). I have gone to great lengths to make sure this book emphasizes both .\nThe important point for this section that follows the above is that hypnotizability may not be as fixed a trait as some believe. Looking back over the sections of this chapter, you can appreciate that there's not much you can do about someone's age, but what about all the  other  factors?  For  example,  can  skills  in  imagination,  and  fantasy-proneness  be taught?  What  about  improving  self-esteem  or  changing  someone's  expectations  and mental status?\nNicholas Spanos proposed a cognitive skills model which viewed hypnotic responding as  a  consequence  of  a  variety  of  skills  such  as  many  of  those  already  discussed  (e.g., absorption,  expectations).  He  argued  quite  convincingly  that  each  of  these  factors  is modifiable  when  people  are  given  helpful  information  and  training  (1982).  Michael Diamond  (1977,  1989)  took  a  similar position to Spanos  and  stated flatly that 'hypnotizability is modifiable' (1977, p. 147). Jeffrey Gfeller (1993) named four specific ways  from  within  the  cognitive  skills  model  that  hypnotizability  might  be  enhanced, making  hypnotic  treatment  more  readily  accessible  to  a  wider  range  of  individuals. Gfeller's four strategies are:\nPortraying  hypnosis  as  a  cognitive  experience  not  far  removed  from  many everyday life phenomena\nDiscussing the concept of goal-directed fantasy or imaginative involvement and its role in hypnotic experience\nElaborating  on  the  importance  of  absorption  and  suspension  of  reality orientation for facilitating optimal hypnotic responsiveness\nExplaining  hypnosis  as  an  active  process  to  be  learned  by  the  patient  as  a coping skill (p. 240)\nIrving Kirsch added his voice to the possibility of enhancing hypnotic responsiveness by",

Present and respect choices as therapeutic double binds, so that either  choice  promotes  improvement.  Prevent  failure  by  beginning  with  easy tasks that the patient is almost certain to accomplish. Proceed gradually to more and  more  difficult  tasks.  Define  tasks  so  that  failure  is  impossible.  Structure expectations so that even small improvements are seen as significant beginnings. Be alert to random fluctuations and capitalize on those that occur in a desired direction. Prepare patients for setbacks by labeling them in advance as inevitable, temporary, and useful learning opportunities. (1994, p. 104)\nSteven Lynn and Steven Sherman (2000) offered an integrative model of hypnosis that also emphasizes the malleability of the hypnotic responsiveness of the individual. They wrote:\nTo optimize responsiveness in clinical situations and to tailor the procedures to the unique characteristics of the individual, the integrative model implies that it is  essential  for  the  therapist  to:  (a)  develop  a  positive  rapport  and  therapeutic alliance  with  the  patient  that  promotes  the  free-flowing  quality  of  hypnotic experience; (b) understand the patient's motives and agenda (i.e., constellation of  plans,  intentions,  wishes,  and  expectancies)  in  relation  to  experiencing hypnosis;  (c)  identify  the  personal  connotations  that  hypnosis  has  for  each patient, including their conflict and ambivalence about experiencing hypnosis; (d)  assess  the  individual's  stream  of  awareness  and  internal  dialogue  during hypnosis;  (e)  modify  suggestions  and  hypnotic  communications  so  as  to minimize resistance and increase a sense of perceived control when it is lacking; (f) encourage patients to adopt lenient or liberal criteria for passing suggestions (e.g.,  'You  don't  have  to  imagine  what  I  suggest  as  being  real,  even  a  faint image  is  fine');  and  (g)  encourage  involvement  in  suggestions,  the  use  of imagination,  and  attention  to  subtle  alterations  in  experiences  and  responses.

You have a person in front of you who  is  in  some  form  of  distress,  and  you  genuinely  want  to  help  make  a  positive difference in this person's life. You gather salient information you believe will help you form  a  sensible  intervention,  and  simultaneously  you  establish  a  nice  rapport  with  the person.  You  suggest  hypnosis  may  be  helpful  in  the  treatment  process  and  invite  the person to  begin  to  focus  on  your  words.  You  suggest  beginning  by  shifting  his  or  her focus inwardly and then you proceed with your induction. What happens to the person as he or she participates in this process? What's qualitatively different, more or less, about the person experiencing hypnosis that makes  performing hypnosis a worthwhile endeavor?\nHypnosis is a highly subjective experience, for no two people experience it in exactly the same way. Appreciating the uniqueness of each person you interact with is a worthy goal in general, but if you want to learn to apply hypnotic patterns effectively, it is a strict requirement.  There  are  certain  assumptions  that  are  beyond  question  and  are  unfailing when doing clinical hypnosis. One concerns the uniqueness of each person and all that uniqueness implies about each person's individual personal history and responses being unlike anyone else's. A second assumption is that each person is going to have his or her own way of experiencing hypnosis; what specific subjective associations your communications will trigger in the client will be unknown to you until they are somehow communicated to you (unless you are a board-certified mind-reader). A third assumption concerns the multidimensionality of hypnotic experience: Whatever  the client is experiencing will have cognitive, behavioral, emotional, spiritual, relational, and physical features. Which dimension(s) you choose to focus on and amplify will be a product of your own style of intervention.\nAs  you  are  now  aware,  the  efforts  to  quantify  and  measure  hypnotic  phenomena  in various research populations have been the backbone of the scientific study of hypnosis. However,  as  Australian  psychologist  Peter  Sheehan  (1992)  pointed  out,  'Adopting  a phenomenological framework is a very useful means of exploring hypnotic phenomena. It enables us to look at processes, for example, in more detail than many other approaches afford, and it reveals the diversity and richness of hypnotic experience and behavior' (p. 364). In this chapter, we will briefly consider many of the most common phenomenological  or  subjective  experiences  of  the  person  in  hypnosis  on  a  variety  of dimensions,  divided  for  simplicity's  sake  into  two  broader  categories:  'psychological' and 'physical' characteristics of hypnosis.",

Many  clients  actively seek  out  hypnosis  as  an  intervention  because  they  have  the  expectation  that  the experience of hypnosis will be powerful, dramatic, and effective (Lynn & Rhue, 1991; Spanos & Coe, 1992). The mind-set of the client is ideally one consistent with the aims of treatment, and building positive expectancy in order to enhance responsiveness is given deliberate attention by the clinician (Yapko, 1992, 2001).",

By implication, we can also not notice what we choose not to. This perceptual phenomenon is referred to as 'selective attention,' that is, the ability to focus on one portion of an experience while 'tuning  out'  the  rest.  Focusing  on  a  specific  stimulus  (usually  your  words  or  your gestures)  to  the  near-exclusion  of  other  ongoing  stimuli  is  a  foundation  of  hypnotic experience  upon  which  the  other  phenomena  rest.  Without  the  focus  to  attend  to  the suggestions of the clinician, not much else that's useful is likely to happen (Spiegel & Spiegel, 1987).\nThe  conscious  mind  is  limited  in  its  ability  to  pay  attention  to  numerous  things occurring simultaneously. We consciously notice only a relatively small part of a total experience.  How  do  you  decide  which  part  of  an  experience  to  pay  attention  to?  For example, at a concert are you more likely to notice how the musicians look, the words to their songs, or how you feel while you're there? Which part of the concert sticks in your memory? Why that particular part?\nThere are a number of complex factors that determine what works its way into one's field of attention. These include: The degree of sensory stimulation (how weak or strong the  stimulus  is);  the  novelty  of  the  stimulus;  the  person's  response  tendencies  (arising from a complex interplay of socialization and genetics); the person's motivation in the context  under  consideration;  the  person's  mood;  and  the  kinds  and  amounts  of  other sensory stimulation co-existing in the environment.\nThe client must gradually selectively attend to the provided suggestions and narrow her attention  to  the  associations  the  suggestions  stimulate.  The  client's  focus  is  generally inward, and so although external events may be noticed and responded to, they typically account  for  only  a  small  portion  of  the  client's  attention.  And,  while  the  person's conscious awareness is focused on specific aspects of their experience, the unconscious mind becomes more prominent in its ability to respond to things outside of the person's attentional field. This is a basis for the next characteristic I will discuss: Dissociation.",

        "text": "Ernest Hilgard's neodissociation model of hypnosis (1991) conceptualizes hypnosis as a relaxation of or decreased reliance on the executive cognitive functions. The 'executive ego,'  or  'central  control  structure,'  is  tasked  with  planning  and  monitoring  various functions of the personality, including the various cognitive subsystems subservient to the executive  ego.  Hilgard  believes  that  in  hypnosis,  the  various  subsystems  can  become independent of or dissociated from one another and can thus respond independently to the clinician's suggestions.\nDissociation, in effect, means that normally integrated and synergistically functioning parts  of  a  person  are  increasingly  able  to  function  autonomously.  Stated  more  simply, while  the  person  in  hypnosis  has  his  or  her  attention  selectively  focused  on  the suggestions of the clinician and whatever unconscious associations may be triggered as a result,  there  is  a  type  of  separation  occurring  between  the  conscious  and  unconscious minds. The conscious mind tends to be occupied with the details of the hypnotic process, while the unconscious tends to actively search for symbolic meanings, past associations, and  appropriate  responses  relevant  to  the  suggestions  received.  This  separation  of conscious  and  unconscious  during  hypnosis  is  accomplished  in  varying  degrees  with different people, and is called 'dissociation.' Dissociation is so critical a component of the experience that it can reasonably be said that hypnosis cannot take place without some degree of dissociation being present. In general, the greater the degree of dissociation, the deeper the person's experience of hypnosis. The fact that the conscious and unconscious minds can be divided and utilized as interdependent yet independent entities is thus the backbone of the clinical applications of hypnosis.\nA  second  aspect  of  dissociation  refers  to  the  sense  of  detachment  people  may experience in some situations, especially traumatic ones (Spiegel, 1993). A third aspect of the dissociative nature of the hypnotic  experience  is evident  in the 'parallel awarenesses'  people  typically  report  they  have  during  hypnosis.  The  person  may  well report about his or her experience something like, ' Part of me was aware of you and what you were saying, and part of me was totally into my own experience and tuned you out.'",

        "text": "The client in hypnosis can have multiple awarenesses, each operating on a separate level. One of these levels is a mostly objective one that has a relatively realistic understanding of  the  nature  of  the  experience,  a  part  of  the  person  Hilgard  (1977)  called  the  'hidden observer.' The 'hidden observer' is separated (dissociated) from the immediacy of the suggested  experiences,  and  can  maintain  a  degree  of  objectivity  about  the  experience. Hilgard  described  it  this  way:  'The  'hidden  observer'  was  intended  merely  as  a convenient  label  for  the  information  source  capable  of  a  high  level  of  cognitive functioning, not consciously experienced by the hypnotized person' (1992, p. 77). This dissociative  characteristic  of  hypnosis  allows  the  client  to  attend  to  and  respond  to suggestions  with  a  'believed-in  imagination'  (Sarbin,  1997),  while  at  the  same  time observing him- or herself go through the experience more objectively. The implication of the hidden observer is that even in deeper hypnotic experiences the client knows what he\nor she is doing and what is going on. As the field has learned the hard way, due primarily to the acrimonious repressed memory controversy, there are extreme conditions in which the person loses clarity for the line separating fantasy from reality and can adopt as 'true' experiences that are not. In the great majority of cases, however, and when sessions are structured  appropriately  by  the  clinician,  the  individual  does  maintain  a  strong  enough reality  orientation  to  discard  offensive  or  even  merely  irrelevant  suggestions  (Lynn  & Rhue, 1991; Sheehan & McConkey, 1982).",

Orne offered this example of a subject's stated perceptions of transparency of another person: 'This is very peculiar: I can see Joe sitting in the chair and I can see the chair through him'(p. 295). Orne termed this phenomenon 'trance logic.'\nIn clinical practice, trance logic refers to the client's lack of need for objectifying his or her experience. In other words, the client can accept a suggested reality, however illogical and even impossible it may be, as if it were the only reality. For example, if I want to do an  intervention  hypnotically  involving  the  client's  currently  inaccessible  parents  (who may live in a distant place or perhaps are deceased), I can suggest to the client that he or she see his or her parents and interact with them on the issue(s) needing resolution. There may be an element of role playing present, but trance logic allows the client to respond to his or her parents in the 'here-and-now' as if they are really there, rather than responding with an intellectual assessment such as, 'How can my parents be here when they live in Europe?'\nThings that don't make much logical sense can make perfect sense to the hypnotized person  engaging  in  trance  logic.  This  affords  the  clinician  the  opportunity  to  conduct clinical sessions that can be highly creative and imaginative, unfettered by a conventional sense of reality. Trance logic is a voluntary acceptance of suggestions on the part of the client,  without  the  critical  evaluation  taking  place  that  would,  of  course,  destroy  the validity  or  meaningfulness  of  provided  suggestions.  The  opportunity  to  act  'as  if' something  were  real  can  be  a  gateway  to  deeper  feelings  and  issues  appropriate  for therapeutic intervention.",

(Consequently, the quotes in this section are taken from his writings and not from personal communications as in most of the other Frame of Reference sections.)\nAs a teacher, scientist, and practicing physician, Dr. Orne's expertise was primarily in the domains of hypnosis and memory distortion. Throughout his illustrious  career,  Dr.  Orne  collaborated  with  his  wife,  psychologist  Emily Orne. Their research on hypnosis and its effects on the accuracy of recall was cited  in  more  than  30  legal  cases  by  state  supreme  courts  and  the  U.S. Supreme Court. His work was so highly regarded and influential that he was given awards for his lifetime contributions from the Ameri-can Psychological Association, the American Psychological Society, and the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.\nBorn  in  Vienna,  Austria,  to  a  surgeon  father  and  a  psychiatrist  mother,  Dr. Orne moved with his parents to the United States in 1938. The Orne family settled in New York, then eventually moved to Boston. Dr. Orne received his bachelor's  degree  from  Harvard  University,  his  medical  degree  from  Tufts University in 1955, did his residency in psychiatry at Massachusetts Mental Health Center, and returned to Harvard to receive his Ph.D. in Psychology in 1958. He was a professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania  for  32  years  before  retiring  as  emeritus  professor  in  1996. Besides  his  seminal  contributions  to  our  understanding  of  the  effects  of suggestion on memory, Dr. Orne was also widely recognized for his work in biofeedback, pain management,  sleep  disturbances, and his exceptional analysis of the role of demand characteristics in hypnotic research in particular and psychological research in general. His contributions to our understanding of  the  social  context  in  which  hypnosis  takes  place  are  profound.  He  was  a prolific  writer,  publishing  hundreds  of  scientific  papers,  many  of  which  are referred to throughout this book and should be considered essential reading. Dr.  Orne  was  also  editor  of  the International  Journal  of  Clinical  and Experimental  Hypnosis for  30  years.  His  interest  in  encouraging  scientific research  on  the  relationship  between  the  mind  and  physical  health  and emotional wellbeing led him to establish the nonprofit Institute for Experimental  Psychiatry  Research  Foundation.  He  served  as  its  Executive Director until, shortly before he died, his declining health precluded him from continuing.\nDr. Orne's expertise in memory distortion arising from suggestive influences and even from coercion led to his involvement as an expert witness in a number of famous and infamous cases. Among them was the 1981 trial of Kenneth Bianchi,  the  former  security  guard  who  confessed  to  being  the  socalled Hillside Strangler, the killer of five women in the late 1970s. Bianchi contended he suffered  from multiple personality disorder, but Dr. Orne was able  to  cleverly  prove  to  the  court's  satisfaction  that  this  explanation  was  a fabrication.  Dr.  Orne  was  also  an  expert  witness  in  the  sensational  Patty Hearst case. Hearst was the heiress who took part in a 1974 bank robbery after being kidnapped and held captive by a radical group known  as the\nSymbionese Liberation Army. Dr. Orne testified to the role of coercion in her participation, and drew upon his extensive knowledge of the phenomenon of mind-control  tactics  he  had  researched  as  part  of  his  interest  in  demand characteristics and suggestibility.\nDr.  Orne's  research  again  took  center  stage  when  the  false  memory controversy  developed  in  the  mid-1990s.  He  helped  expose  the  unfortunate methods  of  some  psychotherapists  who  were  unwittingly  encouraging  the creation of false memories of childhood sexual trauma. Dr. Orne\nused  his  considerable  authority  to  drive  home  the  point  in  his  last  years  of work that he had first made as an undergraduate at Harvard in his very first published  paper:  Age  regressed  adults  are  not  literally  reliving  their  early childhoods, but are recalling them through the filters of adult understandings and perspectives.\nDr.  Orne's  lifetime  achievements  helped  shape  the  modem  practice  of hypnosis in many ways. The following quotes from his writings can give you a glimpse of this very special man.\nO n Suggested Realities in Hypnosis: '…an  important  attribute of hypnosis is a potentiality for the (subject) to experience as subjectively real suggested alterations in his environment that do not conform with reality' (Orne, 1959, p. 297).\nO n Demand  Characteristics  in  Human  Research: 'A  particularly striking aspect of the typical experimenter-subject relationship is the extent to which the subject will play his role and place himself under the control of the experimenter.  Once  a  subject  has  agreed  to  participate  in  a  psychological experiment, he implicitly agrees to perform a very wide range of actions on request without inquiring as to their purpose, and frequently without inquiring as to their duration. Furthermore, the subject agrees to tolerate a considerable degree  of  discomfort,  boredom,  or  actual  pain,  if  required  to  do  so  by  the experimenter. Just about any request which could conceivably be asked of the subject by a reputable investigator is legitimized by the quasi-magical phrase, 'This is an experiment,' and the shared assumption that a legitimate purpose will be served by the subject's behavior' (Orne, 1962, p. 777).\nO n  the  Potential  Harm  to  Clients  When  the  Therapist  is  Misguided: 'The  therapist  using  hypnosis,  like  any  other  therapist,  will  strive  to  ally himself  with  the  healthy  wishes  and  aspirations  of  the  patient,  but  it  is  of course  possible  for  a  disturbed  therapist  to  ally  himself  with  destructive aspects  of  a  patient's  personality  and  facilitate  destructive  behavior'  (Orne, 1972, pp. 113-4).\nO n Being Blinded By Our Desire to Help: 'We should keep in mind that psychologists  and  psychiatrists  are  not  particularly  adept  at  recognizing deception. We generally arrange the social context of treatment so that it is not in the patient's interest to lie to us, and we appropriately do not concern\nourselves with this issue since in most therapeutic contexts it is helpful for the therapist to see the world through the patient's eyes in order to ultimately help him view it more realistically' (Orne, 1979, p. 334).\nOn  More  Detailed  Memories  Not  Necessarily  Being  More  Accurate Memories: 'Typically, age regressed individuals will spontaneously elaborate a myriad of details which apparently could only be brought forth by someone actually observing the events as they transpired. It is these details which sophisticated  clinicians  find  most  compelling  and  occasionally  cause them  to  testify  that  they  know  with  certainty  that  the  individual  was  truly regressed.  It  is  rare  indeed,  however,  for  the  clinician  to  have  the  time, energy, or need to be certain that would cause him to verify the accuracy of an  individual's  description  of  events  that  transpired  many  years  ago  in childhood. Unfortunately, without objective detailed verification, the clinician's  belief  in  the  historical  accuracy  of  the  memories  brought  forth under hypnosis is likely to be erroneous' (Orne, 1979, p. 316).\nO n Hypnosis and the Courts: 'Since it is widely believed by laymen that there is a virtual certainty of obtaining truthful information when a subject's critical  judgment  is  diminished  by  either  hypnosis  or  a  drug,  it  is  hardly surprising  that  efforts  have  been  made  to  introduce  hypnotic  testimony  in court as a way for the defendant to demonstrate his innocence to a jury. The courts, however, have recognized that hypnotic testimony is not reliable as a means of ascertaining truth and appropriately rejected both of these techniques  as  means  of  determining  factual  information'  (Orne,  1979,  p. 313).\nO n the Efficacy of Hypnosis in Relation to Individual Hypnotizability: '…there is ample clinical evidence that the efficacy of hypnotic procedures is often unrelated to an individual's hypnotic talent… This is not to say that the changes  achieved  necessarily  rely  on  the  same  processes  for  persons  with differing  levels  of  hypnotizability.  In  some  circumstances,  the  therapeutic benefit of a hypnotic intervention can be traced to nonspecific aspects of the therapy,  yet  the  treatment  response  may  be  no  less  profound….  Hypnotic procedures  can  have  an  important  effect  on  the  response  of  even  low hypnotizable  individuals,  particularly  in  circumstances  where  the  response does not require extraordinary hypnotic talent' (Orne, Whitehouse, Dinges, & Orne, 1996, p. 355).\nO n  Friendship: 'Friendship  is  a  complex  process.  It  is  sometimes  hard, and often difficult to maintain. But it is joyous, too, and full of unexpected rewards. All that is really needed is the patience and commitment to make it work' (quoted by Bloom, 2000, p. 104).",

        "text": "One of the potential complications, especially in the beginning phases of working with hypnosis,  is  the  phenomenon  known  as  'literalism'  or  a  tendency  toward  the  'literal interpretation' of communication by the person in hypnosis. André Weitzenhoffer, Ph.D., described  it  this  way:  The  term literal and  its  derivatives  has  at  least  a  half  dozen different  but  related  dictionary  meanings  that  focus  on  the  fact  that  all  words  have  a primary,  basic,  habitual,  literal  meaning,  as  contrasted  to  a  figurative  metaphoric  one acquired over time. Some people are more prone to act in terms of this literal meaning even  when  a  figurative  one  is  clearly  intended.  Applied  to  the  hypnosis  situation,  a subject  who  would  respond  to  the  statement  about  someone  present  as  being  'bright,' meaning 'intelligent,'  by seeing the person as surrounded by light, would correctly be considered to have responded literally to the term bright (2000, p. 185).\nMilton Erickson (1980) reported on his subjective assessment of 1,800 hypnotized and 3,000  nonhypnotized  individuals  regarding  the  phenomenon  of  literalism.  He  claimed that the great majority of hypnotized subjects responded literally while the overwhelming majority  (95%)  of  nonhypnotized  individuals  did  not.  (He  asked  them,  'Do  you  mind telling  me  your  name?',  and  a  literal  response  was  either  a  simple  yes  or  no  without offering the name).\nGreen et al. (1990) and Lynn et al. (1990) conducted more well-controlled experiments to test the presence of literalism in hypnotic subjects. Their findings indicate that while literalism may be found in some subjects, the number is relatively small. They conclude that  compliance with perceived task demands better accounts for Erickson's seemingly inflated results.\nThus,  rather  than  a  predictable  characteristic  of  the  hypnotic  experience,  a  tendency toward literal  interpretation  may  best  be  thought  of  as  a  possible  response  style  which might lead the client to react to your words at their face value, in spite of what you may actually  have  meant.  This  is  the  basis  for  developing  a  careful  approach  to  clients  in terms of your word choices. My earliest mentor, clinician Neil Simon, used to tell this story reflecting one of his earliest experiences with literal interpretation in hypnosis. He was working with a woman who wanted hypnotic anesthesia to manage a minor surgery she was going to have on her wrist to remove a growth. Neil provided an induction of hypnosis and directly suggested that she 'develop an anesthesia in your arm.' She did this  quite  readily.  In  order  to  test  her  degree  of  anesthesia,  Neil  took  a  pin  and  gently poked her arm in a series of spots progressively downward from her shoulder. Each poke was met with a comfortable 'No, I can't feel that.'  When  Neil poked  the  back  of  her hand, she yelled 'Ow!' Neil asked, 'What's wrong?' and the woman responded 'You said  my arm was  numb,  not  my hand!' Well,  Neil  knew  what  he  meant-an  arm  is everything from the shoulder down. To his client, though, an arm is an arm and a hand is a  hand,  and  they're  not  the  same!  Needless  to  say,  Neil  learned  quickly  to  be  more specific about what he suggests.\nA  gentle  reminder:  How  a  given  person  will  respond  to  a  word  or  phrase  is unpredictable.  Remember,  the  person  is  using  his  or  her  own  frame  of  reference  (i.e., experience, understanding) to make meaning out of your words. The best you can do is use words carefully enough to leave as little room (or as much room, as the case may be)\nfor  misinterpretation.  Training  in  clinical  hypnosis  with  peers  allows  for  the  kind  of feedback on the impact of your words and phrases that your clients are highly unlikely to provide. Finding out which things you said that enhanced the hypnotic experience and which hindered it are valuable aspects of small-group training in clinical hypnosis.",

        "text": "The  attentional  and  dissociational  factors  described  above  can  lead  to  an  increased responsiveness to suggestion. Increased responsiveness is evidenced  as a greater willingness  in  the  client  to  be  guided  by  the  suggestions  of  the  clinician,  that  is,  to experience the perceptual shifts being suggested. Furthermore, by definition, the person in hypnosis would be more responsive to experiences that, outside of hypnosis, he or she would not be.\nFrom a clinical point of view, when you are concerned about maximizing a client's responsiveness to your treatment, the increased responsiveness hypnosis affords makes it an especially valuable clinical tool. Why are clients more likely to respond? It may be the lowered defenses, the greater focus, the calmer attention to problem-solving, the support of the clinician, and any or all of dozens of such contributing factors.\nResponsiveness  is  not  to  be  confused  with  gullibility,  or  noncritical  acceptance  of suggestions  (Barber,  1969).  Contrary  to  the  mythology,  the  hypnotic  experience  in  a respectful  clinical  or  research  context  actually amplifies a  person's  range  of  choices, including the choice to reject a suggestion that isn't desirable or relevant. The increased responsiveness to suggestion is a choice on the part of the client to be guided by someone he or she trusts and feels is benevolent in wanting to help. If the personal, interpersonal, and contextual dynamics are not favorable, responsiveness is nonexistent and the result is what is classically termed a 'poor response' or even 'resistance.'",

        "text": "There are different cognitive styles, that is,  ways  of thinking about  experience.  This is true not only across individuals, but also within individuals. You have different styles of thinking  about  different  types  of  experiences.  For  example,  some  things  you  may approach  more  globally  or 'holistically,' while other things you  approach  more specifically  or  in  'detail'  (Crawford  &  Allen,  1983),  and  how  you  think  naturally influences your perceptions.\nCognitive  styles  of  the hypnotized  person  have  been  studied  by  a  number  of researchers  (Evans,  1991;  Labelle,  Laurence,  Nadon,  &  Perry,  1990).  Peter  Sheehan (1992)  described  different  cognitive  styles  of  response  to  hypnotic  suggestions,  but concluded '…no one style typifies the response of hypnotic subjects to suggestion, and it is interesting to note that vastly different styles of response may be adopted by equally susceptible subjects' (p. 367). He further noted that, 'A subject may use one or more of these styles during the same hypnotic session, and to a considerable extent the choice of style  varies  with  the  task  complexity…'  (p.  367).  The  ability  to  move  in  and  out  of different cognitive styles, and the different perceptual experiences associated with them, as demand dictates, and as hypnosis enhances, is the essence of cognitive flexibility.\nAs you have learned already, many of the cognitive changes associated with hypnosis surface in the arenas of memory, awareness, absorption, rationality, imaginative ability, imagery, and attention (Barber, 2000; Holroyd, 1992). These have been and continue to be  heavily  researched  since  they  represent  the  more  compelling  aspects  of  hypnosis. Every  clinician  who  uses  hypnosis  is  doing  so  for  the  express  purpose  of  creating perceptual shifts that enhance the client's quality of life. Thus, encouraging a cognitive style that permits excruciating pain to be transformed in perception to a mere annoyance, for  example,  is  an  invaluable  application  of  such  cognitive  research.  Encouraging  a perception  of  accelerated  time  that  permits  a  long  unpleasant  medical  procedure  to subjectively seem to go by quickly (i.e., 'time distortion') is another example of helpful hypnosis. Frederick Evans (1991) has been particularly interested in the greater ease the hypnotized person has in making the transition from one cognitive style to another, or from one form of consciousness to another. He concluded that dissociation is clearly a relevant factor as the person moves from one seemingly discrete portion of experience to another.\nCognitive  flexibility  in  a  clinical  context  has  a  different  connotation  than  in  the research environment, however. Given how often so-called 'cognitive distortions' (i.e., errors  in  information  processing)  are  associated  with  various  disorders  (Beck,  Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979), it becomes an even more vital application of hypnosis to be able to  catalyze  cognitive  shifts  and  promote  cognitive  restructuring.  The  value  of  hypnosis for  enhancing  flexibility,  whether  cognitive,  behavioral,  perceptual,  or  on  many  other dimensions, is a primary reason for integrating hypnosis into psychotherapy in general, and cognitive-behavioral therapies in particular (Yapko, 2001). The empirical evidence supports such applications (Schoenberger, 2000).",

As  you  know,  there  is  no  clearly defined, unambiguous state called 'hypnosis.' From a clinical point of view, rather than theoretical or experimental points of view, we are interested in the client getting focused on suggested ideas, absorbed in generating positive possibilities, and building meaningful internal  associations  to  the  resources  needed  to  live  life  better.  At  just  what  moment  a person  has  gone  from  his  or  her  usual  awareness  to  a  more  focused  and  'hypnotized' experience  is  not  definable  with  scientific  precision.  Instead,  there  are  more  general indicators  of  hypnotic  absorption  that  clinicians  can  use  to  evolve  a  practiced  sense  of when the person is hypnotically engaged (Erickson, Rossi, & Rossi, 1976; Erickson & Rossi, 1979; Weitzenhoffer, 2000).\nPhysical  characteristics  of  hypnosis  are  usually  the  only  indicators  you  will  have available for assessing your client's experience unless you specifically ask for verbal or nonverbal feedback about the client's internal experience. Asking for feedback during the hypnosis  session  is  a  good  idea  if  you  want  to  avoid  the  trap  of  'reading  body language' (i.e., projecting your interpretations onto what someone's behavior 'means').\nYou  can  be  an  excellent  observer  of  your  client's  physical  responses  to  hypnosis",

Unlike routine states of consciousness or even a sleep state in which one is in almost constant motion, the client in hypnosis makes very few, if any, movements. It just takes too much effort for the relaxed and focused client. Furthermore, the client in hypnosis typically feels dissociated (i.e., detached) from his or her body anyway, and so tends to simply forget about it.\nEvery  once  in  a  while,  and  this  is  especially  true  of  children,  you  may  experience someone who moves around a lot rather than being immobile as you might expect. In one training  course,  I  had  a  student  in  the  class  nicknamed  'The  Thrasher.'  When  he experienced  hypnosis  he  liked  to  roll  on  the  floor  and  wriggle  around  quite  a  bit.  On ending the hypnosis, he described how good it felt to relax his body through movement. Interestingly,  though,  further  questioning  revealed  that  a  lot  of  the  movements  he  was making he wasn't even aware of! Even though a client's movement may seem excessive or disruptive, or interpreted as evidence that he or she isn't 'getting into it,' in fact the client may still be in hypnosis.

Some start to feel physically large, and some start to feel very small. Some people feel more closely associated to their body and become  ultrasensitive  to  physical  sensations,  and  others  become  quite  detached  and unaware  of  their  body,  even  to  the  point  of  developing  a  spontaneous  (i.e.,  one  not suggested) analgesia or anesthesia.\nEach of the physical characteristics described above may be used as general indicators of hypnosis, but no one sign alone can tell you what your client is actually experiencing internally.  In  a  sense,  the  clinician  is  a  visitor  to  someone  else's  inner  world,  and  so should be observant, cautious, and above all, respectful.\nYour  assessment  as  to  when  to  shift  from  one  phase  of  your  hypnosis  session  to another, for example, going from induction into therapeutic utilization of the hypnosis, will  be  based  on  how  well  you  observe  changes  in  the  client's  body  and  demeanor.\nTaking an initial  baseline  of  level  of  muscular  tension,  breathing,  and  pulse  rates,  and anything else you can notice before beginning to do hypnosis gives you the opportunity to notice changes which suggest the development of an experience that is different from the baseline. You can't always know what the content of the person's experience is, but you  can  observe  changes  that  suggest  an  impact  from  the  your  guidance.  The  more skilled  you  become  in  observing  such  changes,  the  more  comfortable  you  can  be  in adapting to the ongoing changes in the experience of the client. Many of these changes are listed in Table 1 below.",

        "text": "Assessing  hypnotic behavior is  understandably  popular  as  a  research  method,  since behavior  can  be  observed.  However,  in  doing  clinical  work,  as  valuable  as  objective instruments scoring hypnotic behavior might be, what ultimately matters the most is the individual client's actual experience .  Thus,  some researchers have taken on the task of developing  ways  to  better  understanding  the  phenomenology  of  the  client's  hypnotic experience.  Peter  Sheehan  and  Kevin  McConkey  developed  an  instrument  called  the Experiential Analysis Technique (EAT) for evaluating the heterohypnosis experience\nTable 1. The Experience of Hypnosis\nExperiential and selective absorption of attention\nEffortless expression\nExperiential, nonconceptual involvement\nWillingness to experiment\nFlexibility in time/space relations\nAlterations of perceptions\nFluctuations in degrees of involvement\nMotoric/verbal inhibition\n'Trance logic'; reduction in reality testing\nSymbolic processing\nTime distortion\nSpontaneous amnesia\n(Sheehan & McConkey, 1982; Sheehan, 1992). Erika Fromm and Stephen Kahn (1990) developed  one  for  evaluating  the  self-hypnosis  experience  called  the  Self-Hypnosis Proper  Questionnaire  (SHPQ).  More  recently,  Ron  Pekala  and  V.K.Kumar  (Pekala  & Kumar, 2000; Pekala, 2002) have developed an instrument called the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI), also for heterohypnosis experiences. These instruments,\nand others developed by other researchers, represent important steps in the direction of learning more about the range and quality of peoples' hypnotic experiences.",

        "text": "There was a treatment center here in San Diego years ago that invested a considerable amount of money on creating the 'ideal'  conditions  for  conducting  hypnosis  sessions. They had large egg-shaped chairs you had to crawl into, and once enveloped by the chair, the room with thickly carpeted walls became soundless. Clients would sit in the chairs and listen  to  hypnosis  tapes.  These  special  chairs  were  equipped  with  numerous sound speakers, lights that flashed in sequence, electronic gadgetry to move the arm rests slowly downward  while  the  client  heard  suggestions  for  arm  levitation,  a  fragrance-releasing device  that  might,  for  example,  release  the  smell  of  baby  powder  fragrance  while  the client heard suggestions for age regression, and a variety of other such clever tricks.\nIf you  were  to  ask  the  clinicians  at  this  center  about  the  'best'  environmental conditions for performing hypnosis, I suppose they'd say the environment they created is the ideal. I would disagree. (Apparently, their clients disagreed as well, for they are no longer  in  business!)  From  my  perspective,  and  that  of  virtually  every  clinician  and researcher  who  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the  therapeutic  alliance,  forming  an intense,  warm,  goal-directed  relationship  with  the  client  is  a  necessary  precursor  to making worthwhile therapeutic interventions. Everything else, including the environment in which you do hypnosis, is secondary. Secondary, yes, but not unimportant. There have not been any studies that I am aware of to suggest that one environmental condition (e.g., furniture  arrangement,  lighting)  is  more  likely  to  produce  hypnotic  phenomena  than another. In fact, very few writers in the field have even addressed this topic. In the real world,  clinicians  who  use  hypnosis  do  so  in  all  kinds  of  environments,  from  sterile laboratories with fluorescent lighting and chairs (apparently chosen by someone who was having a bad day); to hospitals or clinics where monitors are beeping and someone in the next room or even the next bed is moaning in pain; to classrooms or lecture halls where it seems every chair creaks at 90 decibels; to offices that look more like living rooms, with fireplaces, couches,  soft  lighting and  soft music  playing  in  the  background.  Not surprisingly, successful hypnosis has been achievable in all of these environments. There are certain environmental conditions that are desirable for doing hypnosis, but they are clearly not essential.",

        "text": "Working  in  a  relatively  quiet  atmosphere  is  especially  helpful.  An  atmosphere  free  of intrusive or, even worse, obnoxious noise, is less bothersome to the client, allowing him or her to focus more on internal experiences rather than external distractions. Realistically, however, phones ring, doors get knocked on, people converse outside your door (if you even have a door), traffic zooms by, planes pass overhead, people upstairs drop  heavy  objects,  people  sneeze,  pets  knock  over  vases,  kids  argue,  and  the  list  of possible  distractions  goes  on  and  on.  No  environment  is  perfectly  quiet  and  free  from external noise, nor does it have to be. A key to helping the client focus internally without being unduly distracted by (though not unaware of) external events lies in your ability to tie  those  events  into  your  process.  By  commenting  on  them  and  framing  them  as 'normal,' the client can let the distractions recede into the background.\nNear the beginning of the hypnotic process, it may help the client diminish external awareness by offering a general suggestion to the effect that: 'Whatever sounds you may hear in the environment around you…as you get more deeply absorbed internally…are routine,  everyday  sounds…and  you  can  let  them  pass  through  your  awareness  just  as quickly as they enter…the sounds of the environment are so routine that you can just let them drift out of your awareness…'\nBy  not  specifying  which  sounds  you  are  referring  to,  you're  offering  a  blanket suggestion to cover all the possibilities. Also, you are avoiding the inappropriate use of negative  suggestions  such  as,  'Don't  notice  the  phone  ringing,'  which  will,  of  course, cause the person to notice it.\nPerhaps the best thing to do if an intrusion occurs is to use a 'chaining'  suggestion structure in which you can comment on the current reality of the intrusion, and then chain (i.e.,  associate)  the  desired  response  to  the  comment.  For  example,  if  the  phone  rings during the hypnosis session, you might comment directly by saying something such as, 'Isn't it nice to know the phone can ring and since you don't have to answer it you can just relax even more deeply.' Or you can comment on it indirectly by saying something such as, 'As you relax, your unconscious mind can call a message up to your conscious mind about relaxing even more deeply.'\nIgnoring the intrusion can inadvertently lead the client to pay even more attention to it. But using the 'accept and utilize' structure in which you acknowledge and make use of ongoing  events, whatever they  are,  allows  the  person  to  more  readily  'let  it  go.' Intrusions  are  integrated  as  part  of  the  experience,  transforming  their  impact  from  a negative to a positive one.",

Furniture\nshould be comfortable and, most important, support the client's head and body. Recliner chairs  or  chairs  with  footstools  are  quite  good  for  this  reason.  Beds  or  couches  to  lie prone on may be too suggestive and, furthermore, are likely to put the client to sleep, which you definitely don't want to happen during typical hypnosis sessions.\nAs a final environmental consideration, Australian psychologist George Burns in his book, Nature-Guided Therapy (1998), made a compelling case for wanting to move at least some of the therapy outdoors, if possible, making use of the natural environment as a stimulus for greater comfort. The sounds and sensations of being in a natural setting can be quite conducive to the hypnotic experience.",

If the person has adequate focus, then hypnosis should be helpful.

        "text": "Similar diminished responses can exist for the tired or exhausted client. Given how many people are working too hard and getting too little sleep, this is a commonly encountered impairing factor. Such tired clients may be easy to put to sleep (unintentionally, as they relax and then drift off, if you let them) but are difficult to get to focus internally.\nThe less you assume about your client, the more objective feedback you will want to seek  about  his  or  her  condition.  You  cannot  assume  the  person  has  normal  hearing, normal physiology,  no  contact  lenses,  no  gum  in  the  mouth,  no  use  of  street  drugs  or\nalcohol on therapy days, and so forth. It takes only moments to ask, and your sensitivity to such  issues  can  save  you  a  lot  of  frustration  later.  The  key  here,  as  in  the environmental conditions, is to use the spontaneous events that arise. If a client coughs, don't fret. Accept and utilize it by saying something such as, 'As you clear your throat, your throat can relax…and then you can relax even more deeply.' Or, you can offer some statement that is less direct, such as, 'It's good to clear the way …in order to be able to swallow new ideas.'\nWhen a client coughs or sneezes, the session is far from ruined. You can acknowledge that  the  client's  hypnotic  experience  has  lightened  at  that  particular  moment,  and  then you can use it to help the person go deeper into hypnosis again. Realistically, no one ever nose-dives  into  deep  hypnosis  and  then  stays  there  anyway.  The  person's  hypnotic experience is generally fluctuating throughout the sessions, lightening and deepening in intensity  from  moment  to  moment.  That's  normal  and  to  be  expected,  which  you probably  know from your own experience by now. (That's why the old incantation of saying 'deeper, deeper, deeper' to the client is a poor representation of the experience.)\nFollowing the 'suggestion chaining' format of tying 'what is' to 'what can be' is the key to coping with environments that aren't perfect and clients who sneeze, cough, laugh, or cry in the middle of your hypnotic process. It is important that you can get comfortable in tying spontaneous  occurrences  into  your  work.  No  environment  is  completely controllable-you just have to 'go with the flow.' Ultimately, skilled communication is a principal factor in successful hypnosis-not the chair you use.",

As attorney and hypnosis expert Alan Scheflin wrote:\nUp until 1980…there had not been a single appellate legal decision in all of the country (referring to the United States) involving a lawsuit against a therapist for  the  manner  in  which  the  therapy  had  been  conducted,  excluding  cases  of inappropriate physical contact or sexual intimacy… In the 1980s, however, the legal climate turned inhospitable to the practice of therapy. By the 1990s, nearly 1,000 lawsuits had been filed against…mental health professionals, challenging the  therapies  practiced,  and  even  the  realm  of  psychotherapy  itself.  (2001,  p. 158)\nThe legal  issues  associated  with  responsible  clinical  practice  in  general  obviously  also apply  to  the  use  of  hypnosis  as  well.  However,  the  use  of  hypnosis  in  one's  clinical practice  adds  additional  potential  legal  liabilities  of  which  you  must  be  aware.  These grew  to  especially  dramatic  proportions  in  the  wake  of  the  repressed  memory/false memory controversy. The majority  of  the  lawsuits  Scheflin  refers  to  above  directly  or indirectly  involved  hypnosis  that  was  charged  with  being  applied  inappropriately  by ignorant (rarely malicious) clinicians.\nIn this section I will address only one of these issues, but it is enough to highlight to you the vital importance of your checking with your particular state's (or country's, as the  case  may  be)  laws  about  treatment  issues  with and without  hypnosis.

Doctors are required to explain treatment options (e.g., surgery, medications) and provide helpful data about the  chances  for  successful  intervention  with  the  various  options  in  order  to  help guide the patient's choices.\nDoes  the medical model  apply to the context of psychotherapy? How  much information  can  a  clinician  provide  without  impairing  the  spontaneity  and  emotional power of his or her intervention? (Can you imagine saying to a client, 'I'm going to do a paradoxical  intervention  now  in  order  to  indirectly  encourage  you  to  take  a  contrary position  to  my  stated  one  because  that's  really  the  one  I  want  you  to  take!'?)  Despite informed consent obviously not fitting the psychotherapy context as well as a medical one,  Scheflin  described  'a  growing  movement'  in  the  legal  community  'to  demand  a new, specialized form of informed consent before any therapy is undertaken' (2001, p. 162).\nHypnosis faces a number of specific vulnerabilities to the need for informed consent. One especially important one, highlighted in this section, concerns what is known in the legal  realm  as  a  'per  se  exclusion  rule'  regarding  hypnotically  obtained  testimony (Giannelli,  1995).  Many  courts  throughout  the  United  States  have  adopted  a  per  se exclusion rule which excludes the testimony of any witness, other than the accused, who has  been  hypnotized.  Courts  have  relied  heavily  on  the  testimony  of  hypnosis  experts who have said in no uncertain terms that hypnotically influenced testimony is inherently unreliable and should therefore be precluded from being offered into evidence.\nThis is an unfortunate and exaggerated response: Hypnotically derived information can be unreliable, but is not inherently unreliable. More prudent courts think of hypnosis as much the same as any other means of getting information: Maybe it's wholly right, partly right, partly wrong, or wholly wrong, and needs additional validation in order to evaluate it.\nHow  might  the  per  se  exclusion,  if  it  operates  in  your  state,  affect  your  practice? Consider this realistic case scenario: A woman is attacked and badly beaten. She seeks therapy for her post-traumatic stress symptoms. The therapist, with the absolute best of intentions,  does  hypnosis  with  this  woman  to  reduce  her  distress  and  catalyze  her recovery The therapist did not know about (or simply forgot) about the per se exclusion rule, nor did the therapist know the assailant had been caught and the woman was going to have to pick him out of a lineup and then testify as a witness against him in court. You can probably see where this is going. When the defense attorney finds out she has been hypnotized  for  her  post-traumatic  symptoms,  he  files  for  a  dismissal  based  on  the inadmissibility  of  her  evidence  because  it  is  presumably  hypnotically  tainted.  End  of\ncase.  (Not  really,  though, because that same client is likely to sue the therapist for not providing  an  informed  consent  that  by  doing  hypnosis  with  her  it  would  preclude pursuing her claim.)\nInforming  the  client  about  possible  memory  distortions  from  hypnosis  remains  a controversy  within  the  field,  and  simply  highlights  the  turmoil  left  in  the  wake  of  the repressed memory/false memory  wars  (Frischholz, 2001; Hammond,  Scheflin, & Vermetten, 2001; Lynn, 2001; Spiegel, 2001).\nInformed  consent  means  patients  must  be  informed  about  the  treatment  options available,  the  scientific  merits  of  the  treatments  the  clinician  intend  to  provide,  any untoward potential consequences of the chosen treatment (that builds positive expectations, doesn't it?), and the likely consequences of no treatment (Scheflin, 2001). Informing the client about the research evidence for hypnotic procedures is growing in acceptance as simply good practice, even if not (yet) legally required.",

        "text": "There is perhaps no one domain within the field of hypnosis that divides researchers and clinicians more than their sharply differing viewpoints about the use of standardized tests to assess  hypnotic  responsiveness  in  people.  This  chapter  explores  the  conflicting viewpoints and presents several of the more widely used instruments and approaches for assessing hypnotic responsiveness. While it is a relatively unanimous observation shared by almost everyone in the field that people differ substantially in their hypnotic abilities, the  use  of  a  standardized  means  for  assessing  individual  responsiveness  seems  to  be undesirable to most clinicians, who apparently would rather learn from direct experience with the client what his or her unique hypnotic talents might be. In one of the few studies of  its  kind,  Sheldon  Cohen  (1989)  surveyed  faculty  members  teaching  at  an  annual meeting  of  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Hypnosis  (ASCH),  the  largest  national professional  hypnosis  society  in  the  world,  regarding  their  use  of  formal  measures  of hypnotizability. Cohen discovered that only slightly more than half of respondents had ever used tests of hypnotic responsiveness, and of these fewer than a third were current users.\nIn  recent  years,  however,  the  climate  has  changed.  The  pressure  to  perform  formal hypnotizability testing has greatly increased from within the profession as its members strive to have hypnosis better recognized as a science. The pressure to define hypnosis in scientific terms has been a long time coming since experimental psychologist Clark Hull first  brought hypnosis into the laboratory in the 1920s and published the first scientific book ever on hypnosis with his classic work, Hypnosis and Suggestibility (1933/2002). The  pressure  to  define  hypnosis  as  a  science  has  increased  exponentially  in  the  last decade, as the push within the health care professions, especially psychology, has been to provide  objective  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  specific  forms  of  intervention.  The intense demand from insurance companies, consumers, and allied professionals for proof that  a  method is an 'empirically supported treatment' (EST) has catalyzed the demand from within the hypnosis community, primarily the researchers, for a more objectively measurable approach to the practice of clinical hypnosis. Many of the most influential people in the field have gone on record as strong advocates for not only the desirability but the necessity of formal assessment of hypnotic responsiveness (Laurence, 1997; Lynn & Shindler, 2002; Nadon, 1997). It is too soon to know whether or just how much the call  for  testing  has  changed  the  minds  and  practices  of  clinicians,  who  appreciate  the science of hypnosis but also recognize hypnosis will always be primarily about clinical artistry (i.e., judgment, adaptability, creativity).",

        "text": "More  than  a  few  clinicians  and  researchers  have  publicly  expressed  doubts  about  the merits of hypnotizability testing. In this section I will sample but a few of the opinions voiced by well-known experts on the matter.\nPsychologist  Michael  Diamond  (1989),  in  the  very  title  of  his  article,  asked,  'Is Hypnotherapy Art or Science?' In it he asserted that standardized tests can provide only a general index of general hypnotic ability, rather than objective measures of the specific abilities  that  will  influence  actual  responses  to  therapy  involving  hypnosis.  He  further stated that little can be learned from a standardized test of hypnotizability that couldn't be better learned from more natural, less intrusive methods.\nPsychologist  Stephen  Gilligan  (1987)  made  a  similar  point  about  the  limits  of standardization  as  it  specifically  applies  to  hypnosis,  though  more  colorfully:  '…the standardized approach attributes both success and failure in the hypnotic encounter to the subject .  The  hypnotist  is  not  that  important.  There  are  some  major  problems  with  this approach.  First  it  assumes  that  a  standardized  induction,  which  essentially  instructs  a person to relax and imagine various things, is a valid way of assessing an individual's general hypnotic ability. This is like assessing dancing skill in terms of one's ability to do the  fox  trot.  The  point  is  that  some  people  can  disco  but  not  waltz;  others  can  square dance  but  not  boogie,  and  so  forth…  A  second  problem…is  that  it  defines  hypnotic ability  in  terms  of behavioral responses  to  test  suggestions.  While  using  external behaviors  to  assess  an  internal  state  is  understandable,  especially  in  the  experimental domain,  it  shades  a  major  point:  trance  is  primarily  an experience, like  love  or  anger, which will be different for different individuals' (pp. 7-8).\nPsychologist and past president of the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis (SCEH) Joseph Barber (1989, 1991) also made an important distinction between one's hypnotizability  scores  and  actual  hypnotic  capacity.  He  believes  that  hypnotizability scores  are  not  especially  helpful  in  predicting  clinical  outcomes.  He  further  believes, however,  that  such  scores  might  help  shape  your  approach  to  a  client,  suggesting  that how direct  or  indirect  you  might  be  in  offering  suggestions  may  be  influenced  by  the person's level and quality of responsiveness.\nUnlike the others, who may not advocate for suggestibility testing but are not against it,  psychologist  Ernest  Rossi  (1989)  was  quite  adamant  in  his  dismissal  of  such  tests when he said, '…sensitive and humanistically oriented therapists avoid subjecting their already wary and weary patients to yet another power-trip, thinly veiled as 'an objective measure of hypnotic susceptibility'' (p. 15).\nThe most widely used hypnotizability  assessment  instruments,  considered  the  'Gold Standard'  by  many  in  the  profession,  are  the Stanford  Hypnotic  Susceptibility  Scales (Forms  A,  B,  and  C),  co-developed  by  psychologists  André  Weitzenhoffer  and  Ernest Hilgard,  names  quite  familiar  to  you  by  now.  Thus,  it  may  come  as  a  surprise  that Weitzenhoffer  has  publicly  taken  the  position  that  the  scales  are  largely  irrelevant  to clinical practice. He wrote:\nIf  there  is  no  real  reason, besides the time required by doing so, against using scales  in  the  clinical  situation…it  remains  to  consider  why  a  clinician  might want to use them aside from scientific reasons for doing so. Apart from this last, there seems to be little reason for it. This may come as a shock, being said by the main developer of the leading modern scale, and it has shocked many of my colleagues.\nThe fact is that for many years this writer's position has been that from the standpoint of the everyday clinical practice of hypnosuggestion, using scales on a regular  basis  is not  particularly  useful  for  purposes  of  doing  effective hypnotherapy.  I  must  emphasize  this  last  because  some  of  my  colleagues strongly advocate that clinicians routinely use an approved scale and some have upbraided me for advocating otherwise. But to what purpose? To show that one is a scientist as well as a clinician? Nonsense! There is much more than that to being scientific. (2000, pp. 276-7)\nWeitzenhoffer,  commenting  about  the  relationship  between  responses  to  test  items  and eventual responses to therapy, went on to say:\nFor one thing, such scales as are available test for specific effects. It is only to the extent that one can generalize from the response to a specific test suggestion to an entire class of more or less like suggestions that a useful prediction can be made.  There  is  little  evidence  this  can  be  done  effectively…  In  the  end,  one usually has to go directly to the production of the desired effect to find out if it can be done… Either the effect can be done when the time comes or it cannot… Trial-and-error is most often the order of the day. (2000, p. 466)\nThe  incongruity  of  attempting  to  define  hypnosis  as  science  when  prominent  experts continue to argue about how to define hypnosis; how to measure the hypnotic condition; what  constitutes  increased  suggestibility;  what  constitutes  a  hypnotic  response;  why 'hypnosis is a stable trait' that varies with expectancy, social and contextual conditions; why people generate hypnotic phenomena while they're active and alert and no induction has  been  performed,  and  dozens  of  other  such  'flies  in  the  ointment'  has  not  deterred those who advocate the scientific position. From within that position, formal assessment is considered fundamental.",

        "text": "Formal assessment of hypnotizability has been a primary means of identifying the now well-established fact that people differ in their level of response to hypnotic suggestions. As a means of studying differences between individuals and specific group populations, hypnosis assessment tools provide similar benefits to other standardized instruments that reveal differences on other characteristics of interest. Without a means of standardizing test  instruments,  we  lose  the  ability  to  correlate  hypnotizability  with  any  other  trait  or characteristic we want to test, such as treatment responsiveness or intelligence.\nStructured approaches to assessing hypnotic responsiveness   191GLYPH<9>\nAs  in  the  previous  section,  I'll  let  some  of  the  experts  who  advocate  for  formal assessment speak for themselves.\nPsychologists  and  researchers  Steven  Lynn  and  Kelley  Shindler  (2002)  summarized many of the most pointed arguments in favor of testing when they wrote:\nAssessment  can  contribute  to  an  understanding  of  the  various  components  of hypnotic  responsiveness  and  thus  play  a  role  in  optimizing  responsiveness  to hypnotic procedures…(another) reason to assess hypnotizability is if there are great costs associated with the failure to hypnotize someone, or if there are clear benefits associated with a positive response to hypnosis…(and) assessment of hypnotizability is important because research has established that a link exists between hypnotizability and certain disorders and conditions and their successful treatment with hypnotic interventions. (pp. 187-89)\nPsychiatrists  Herbert  and  David  Spiegel,  in  their  book Trance  and  Treatment (1978) which introduced another assessment instrument, the Hypnosis Induction Profile (HIP), discussed in some detail later, stated the rationale for such instruments clearly when they wrote: 'Trance capacity, as measured by the Hypnosis Induction Profile, has a significant relationship to the total adult personality structure…. The assessment of hypnotizability is a useful diagnostic aid that can facilitate the choice of an appropriate treatment modality along the entire spectrum of mental health and illness.' (p. 4)\nPsychologist  and  researcher  Ernest  Hilgard  was  an  especially  strong  advocate  for formal assessment. He succinctly stated why when he said:\nThe characteristic of an unscientific therapy is that there is only one disease and only one cure: such therapies imply that everyone can profit from the favored therapy regardless of the presenting problem. A scientific therapy is based on a diagnosis,  which  in  psychotherapy  means  selecting  the  therapy  of  choice appropriate to fit the patient's condition. Hypnosis is only one of these choices, and its choice and the manner of its use can profit from some estimate of the individual's hypnotic responsiveness. (1982, p. 400)\nPsychologist Ronald Pekala (2002) advocated for the use of formal assessments for quite a  different  reason  when  he  suggested  clients  can  benefit  from  knowing  'where  they stand' on the issue of hypnotizability. By knowing something about their own capacity as measured by a test, clients in therapy can live up to-or be motivated to even exceedthe measured capacity. Pekala wrote:\nOf course, if no actual assessment of hypnotizability is done before a treatment intervention, the client may not have a good idea as to how hypnotizable they actually are, because there are no salient clues to inform them of such. Some clinicians believe that without the clients' knowledge of their actual hypnotizability  level,  positive  expectancy  effects  and  placebo  effects  will engender positive therapeutic outcomes, regardless of hypnotic ability. Although  this  may  be  true  with  some  clients,  I  believe  it  is  better  to  have knowledge about a person's hypnotizability level and tailor a treatment plan to\nthat level, instead of hoping that positive expectancy effects will do the rest. (p. 245)\nPsychologists  William  Kronenberger,  Linn  LaClave,  and  Catherine  Morrow  (2002) acknowledge  the value of an initial assessment such as those obtained through standardized instruments, but go a step further when they advocate for the use of formal assessment on a session-by-session basis. The value of measurement information obtained in an individual clinical hypnosis session led them to develop their instrument, called the Hypnotic State Assessment Questionnaire (HSAQ). In describing the value of individual session  assessment  in  addition  to  standard  hypnotic  responsiveness  assessment,  they wrote:\nClinical hypnotic response quantifies a patient's behaviors and experiences in a single hypnosis session that is clinically focused, (usually) individually tailored to  the  patient's  issues,  and  placed  in  the  context  of  an  extended  treatment (usually  involving  multiple  hypnosis  sessions).  The  assessment  of  clinical hypnotic response typically is useful for such tasks as documenting a patient's response  to a particular induction technique, evaluating the impact  of a particular set of suggestions, keeping accurate and useful chart notes, monitoring change across sessions, and communicating with trainees about the response of their patients. (p. 258)\nAttorney Alan Scheflin (2001) advocated for formal assessment for one simple reason: to reduce legal liability. By employing a standardized instrument, one's treatment plan can be viewed as being based on 'scientific data about the patient' (p. 165). That may be a defensive recommendation, but in today's litigious environment, it is not an unreasonable one.\nClearly, there are wise  and  well-considered  viewpoints  advocating  for  virtually opposite positions on the use of standardized instruments for assessing hypnotic responsiveness. The environment in which you work, the degree of affinity you have for testing, the importance placed on it by colleagues and teachers you have, and many other factors will have to be weighed by you to decide whether testing will be important in your practice of hypnosis.",

Philosophically,  I  am  most  aligned  with  the  view  of  hypnotic  capacity  as  a potential  that  can  only  emerge  under  the  right  personal,  interpersonal,  and  contextual conditions. All  the  research  about  'low  hypnotizables'  improving  markedly  under adaptive  clinical  conditions  (Gearan,  Schoenberger,  &  Kirsch,  1995;  Spanos,  1991) highlights for me what I had already learned in practice: the test score is less important than the clinical response. Thus, I assume the inevitable presence of suggestibility on the part of my client. Instead of attempting to discover if my client is suggestible, I find it a much more practical use of my mental energy to discover how I can best structure my\nsuggestions  to  increase  the  likelihood  of  their  getting  accepted.  For  the  clinician  who does  not  share  this  perspective,  or  for  the  clinician  who  does  not  yet  feel  experienced enough  to  assess  a  client's  spontaneous  communi-cations  for  suggestibility  dynamics, formal  suggestibility  tests  may  be  a  useful  tool.  As  noted  above,  there are some very good reasons for wanting to use them. That is the basis for their inclusion in this book. (Continued on page 223.)",

        "text": "Ernest R. 'Jack' Hilgard, Ph.D. (1904-2001), was one of the 20th century's leading  psychologists,  and  when  he  turned  his  attention  to  the  subject  of hypnosis relatively late in his professional life, he helped propel hypnosis into the  spotlight  as  an  area  worthy  of  serious  inquiry.  Dr.  Hilgard  received  his Ph.D. in 1930 from Yale. His early career interest was in the area of learning. In 1933, he and his wife of two years, Josephine, who already had a Ph.D. in developmental psychology, moved to Stanford where he soon became a full professor in the Department of Psychology. His early works are classics, and include Conditioning and Learning (1940), Theories of Learning (1948), and his  runaway  best-selling  introductory  psychology  textbook, Introduction  to Psychology (1953).  He  stayed  at  Stanford  University  for  the  rest  of  his  life and  eventually  retired  as  Emeritus  Professor  following  a  long  and  highly distinguished career. He was a past president of the American Psychological Association, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\nTogether  with  André  Weitzenhoffer,  Ph.D.,  Dr.  Hilgard  established  a hypnosis  laboratory  at  Stanford  in  which  countless  valuable  studies  on hypnosis  were  conducted.  Together,  they  co-created  the Stanford  Hypnotic Susceptibility  Scales, among  the  first  and  probably  still  the  best  objective measure  of  hypnotic  responsiveness.  Their  widespread  use  in  research continues  to  this  day,  and  so  directly  and  indirectly  Dr.  Hilgard  has  helped shape the nature of hypnosis research for all  the  years since  he  first  tasked himself  with  trying  to  understand  hypnosis  and  hypnotic  phenomena.  Dr. Hilgard  is  responsible  for  the  Neo-Dissociation  Theory  of  hypnosis,  best articulated in his 1977 book, Divided Consciousness, including his influential concept of the 'hidden observer,' a part of the person that could remain at least  somewhat  objective  about  ongoing  events  during  hypnosis  despite whatever  subjective  experiences  the  subject  might  be  having.  Dr.  Hilgard's findings on the differences in individual responsiveness to hypnotic suggestions  led  to  his  classic  1965  book, Hypnotic  Susceptibility, and  his subsequent  research  on  pain  control  through  hypnosis  led  to  his  highly influential  1975  book  co-authored  with  his  wife, Hypnosis  in  the  Relief  of Pain . Dr. Hilgard, through his warm, gentle, and respectful demeanor\nand his encyclopedic knowledge of psychology and hypnosis, represented the\nbest the field had to offer. Dr. Hilgard was instrumental in making hypnosis a respectable  and  worthwhile  phenomenon  to  study  in  the  laboratory  and  to practice in health care settings.\nO n His Interest in Hypnosis: 'I  was at Yale as an instructor at the time that Clark Hull wrote his book on hypnosis and suggestibility, so I had some familiarity with it as a respectable topic for an experimenter. But, at the time I was  interested  in  moving  my  career  in  other  directions.  I  didn't  really participate  in  his  work,  though  I  think  it  made  a  difference  to  know  that  it would be a reputable thing to do. So, I started rather late in my career, after I had  been  well  established  in  general  psychology  and  particularly  in  the psychology of learning. I had the feeling that much of psychology dealt with rather superficial aspects of mental life. I thought it would be interesting to go into  something  that  had  more  psychology  in  it.  I  felt  that,  in  some  sense, hypnosis  really  had  psychology  in  it.  How  to  get  the  psychology  out  of  it, that's our own problem!'\nO n the Use of the Stanford Scales in Therapy: 'I think that if I take just a sociological or political point of view, a scale is really very useful, and is more useful for clinicians than they like to admit. Whenever it's been tried on anything severe,  like  severe  pain,  there's  no  question  that  you  have  greater success  with  a  more  highly  hypnotizable  as  measured  by  the  scale,  not  as measured  by  some  external  method.  Not  that  a  person  without  a  scale couldn't arrive at it by using various kinds of tests for analgesia and that sort of thing. From my point of view, that's the same kind of item you have on the scale anyhow. But if you want to use other techniques or something of that sort or recovered memories, it's kind of nice to know how readily you can get genuine age regressions where they relive their entire childhood.'\nO n Defining 'Trance': 'I  never  use  the  word  'trance,'  so,  in  that  sense it's fair to say I'm less traditional. But these things are a matter of gradation. My own position, which I have described in neo-dissociation terms, is  that you could have dissociations of various degrees…. '[So] when people use the word 'trance' they should really use it for a pretty massive set of dissociations so  that  you  sense  the  personality  change  or  that  the  whole  orientation  to reality is somewhat changed.'\nO n the Need for Hypnosis Research: 'It's  the  same problem in another sense with psychoanalysis. They never really wanted to do any real research. They thought psychoanalysis was itself a research method. You studied the individual and in a sense that's what Ericksonian treat\nment is-it's a research method to try and get a plan for the individual and if it  works-[good!] But that isn't  the  way science is built. So,  if  there's  any message I have, it is to not get scientistic, you don't have to have analysis of variance  and  become  a  slave  to  statistics,  [but  at  least  have]  just  garden variety statistics: Here's half a dozen people that have these same symptoms;\nthey've  been  treated  in  three  different  ways.  Why  were  the  different  ways chosen? Was it just arbitrary? Why were some of them started in one way and then shifted to another? Put some little design into it.'\nO n the Importance of Hypnosis in His Career: 'I would say that I really found  the  hypnosis  period  the  most  satisfactory  in  my  career.  I  have  this feeling that almost every time, even just in giving a simple scale of hypnosis, I learned something. It wasn't something I was necessarily ready to verbalize, but  I  learned  about  different  kinds  of  responses  to  amnesia,  or  to  age regression, or to hallucinated voices, and so on.'\nSource: Personal communication, 1988",

        "text": "The chief purpose of suggestibility tests is to determine the person's degree, if any, of hypnotizability. Hypnotizability is generally defined in testing conditions as behaviorally manifested  evidence  of  having  responded,  in  whole  or  in  part,  to  the  clinician  or researcher's  suggestions  for  various  kinds  of  experiences.  Suggestibility  tests  will  be divided in the latter part of this chapter into two general categories: Formal and informal. Examples of each will be presented. Beyond determining hypnotizability, suggestibility tests can serve a number of other purposes as well, as some of those experts quoted above alluded to. For example, by using suggestibility tests to measure responsiveness, the test information can yield insight into what approaches may be best (i.e., easiest to relate to, most comfortable to assimilate) for a particular client. Specifically, should your approach be  a  primarily  (not  exclusively)  direct  or  indirect  one?  Should  your  suggestions  be primarily  in  a  positive  or  negative  form?  Should  your  demeanor  be  a  commanding, authoritarian one, or an easy-going, permissive one? I have placed considerable emphasis on the relationship dynamics between clinician and client, and suggestibility tests may be a useful tool to help you assess your approach with a particular client. This presupposes, of  course,  a  willingness  on  your  part  to  adapt  yourself  to  each  client.  There  are  those clinicians who take the position that this is neither necessary or desirable. Obviously, I disagree.\nA  second  positive  purpose  of  the  suggestibility  test  is  to  serve  as  a  conditioning experience  for  entering  hypnosis.  The  suggestibility  test  is,  in  a  way,  an  abbreviated version of the hypnotic encounter. By having the client focus his or her attention on an induction  process  and  then  respond  to  requests  to  generate  hypnotic  behavior,  you provide him or her what may well be his or her first 'official' hypnotic experience. Use of  the  experience  as  a  foundation  for  future  similar  experiences  starts  to  condition  the client to the experience of entering hypnosis while having his or her experience guided by the clinician. Thus, the client has an opportunity to build rapport in the relationship with the clinician, begin to build trust in the clinician, and begin to build confidence in his or her own ability to experience hypnosis.\nA third helpful function of the suggestibility test is its ability to accomplish what I call 'pre-work work.' If the suggestibility test is introduced as merely a preliminary to the\n'real' therapeutic work to be done, it can be an opportunity to catch the client 'off guard' and  offer  some  therapeutic  suggestions  perhaps  less  subject  to  critical  analysis  by  the client.  This  can  be  accomplished  by  offering  a  suggestion  such  as,  'Before  we  begin, would you prefer to go into deep hypnosis in this chair or the other one over there?' This suggestion is considered an example of a 'double bind' because both of the alternatives offered  the  client  include  going  into  deep  hypnosis.  When  prefacing  the  bind  with, 'Before we begin…,' the client is not yet asked to actively participate and so may not be consciously critical of the bind the clinician has employed. Either choice the client makes presupposes the development of deep hypnosis, and the 'pre-work work' of preparing the client for hypnosis is thus accomplished.",

        "text": "In 1957, Ernest Hilgard and André Weitzenhoffer, as the principal investigators, began comprehensive studies of hypnotic responsiveness at Stanford University. In 1959, they had  developed  two  alternate  forms  of  a  scale  that  came  to  be  known  as  the  Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale (SHSS): Forms A and B (Weitzenhoffer & Hilgard, 1959). Two forms were developed in order to permit repeated measures without results getting distorted  from  a  'practice  effect.'  The  scale  consists  of  12  items,  with  instructions  for each  item  fully  scripted  for  wording  to  be  exact  and  replicable  by  whomever  is administering  the  test.  There  were,  of  course,  objective  criteria  for  scoring  each  item, yielding an overall score reflecting hypnotizability.\nIn  Form  A,  the  items  included  a  'postural  sway'  (suggestions  of  standing,  swaying, and involuntarily falling backward), eye closure (suggestions for feelings of fatigue in the eyes and a desire for closing the eyes), hand lowering (arm extended, suggestions given for  heaviness),  a  'finger  lock'  (fingers  are  interlocked  and  suggestions  are  given  the hands will be difficult to pull apart), a fly hallucination (suggestions for an imaginary fly buzzing about), posthypnotic suggestion for changing chairs (suggestions given that after hypnosis, a pencil tap would lead the subject to change chairs and have no recollection of why), and several other items. When subjects respond within the allotted time and in the suggested way, they get a point for each item. 'Very High' hypnotizables, as you would predict, score positively on all or nearly all the items (11 or 12). Forms A and B were generally well received. However, since most of the items involved motoric responses, and  because  it  did  not  distinguish  well  more  specific  characteristics  of  the  'highs,'\nWeitzenhoffer and Hilgard went on to develop a third form of the SHSS, Form C (1962). It  was  intended  to  highlight  more  of  the  cognitive  elements  of  hypnotic  experience.  It, too, features 12 items, but includes different items that examined distortions of perception and memory, and presents items in an ascending order of difficulty, with a point given for each  positive response.  All  forms  of  the  SHSS  take  approximately  one  hour  to administer. 'Very highs' score 11-12, 'Highs' score 8-10, 'Mediums' score 5-7, and 'Lows' score 0-4.\nThe  SHSS  is  probably  the  best  researched  and  most  widely  used  instrument  for establishing norms within and across populations. It has also been modified for a variety of special purposes (see Weitzenhoffer, 2000, for a detailed consideration). As mentioned earlier, many consider it the 'Gold Standard' by which other tests are measured.",

It was designed to be able to administer to group sizes of up to 20 people simultaneously, and is still extremely popular with many researchers and clinicians. It's entirely possible that  more people use this test than the SHSS: C. Like the SHSS: A from which it was adapted, it  includes  12  items  and  takes  about  an  hour  to  administer.  Unlike  any  of  the SHSS forms, the HGSHS: A is group administered by audiocassette. It was first designed as  a  preliminary  screening  tool,  a  nonthreatening  way  to  get  an  initial  impression  of hypnotic responsiveness, but the time-saving factor of testing 20 people simultaneously in one hour instead of only one became a very attractive advantage to examiners.",

        "text": "The Hypnosis Induction Profile (HIP) was developed primarily by psychiatrist Herbert Spiegel, joined later by his son David Spiegel (1978). (David Spiegel is the subject of a Frame of Reference section in chapter 17.) Unlike other scales, the HIP was developed in a clinical setting with patients in treatment where the 'motivation is likely to be greater because  the  patient  is  seeking  help  with  a  personal  problem  rather  than  exercising curiosity'  (p.  38).  They  were  dissatisfied  with  the  SHSS  and  HGSHS:  A  because  the length  of  time  they  took  to  administer,  and  they  thought  several  of  the  items  were potentially too embarrassing. The HIP involves items similar in structure to the SHSS and HGSHS: A (e.g., arm levitation and amnesia), but has the unique additional feature of the 'eye-roll' test. Subjects are told to roll their eyes up as if looking through the top of their head (the 'up-gaze' part of the test), and then strive to close their eyes (the 'roll' part of the test). The amount of the sclera (whites of the eyes) showing as the eyes raise and then close, each rated on a 5-point scale, are added together to yield the 'eye roll sign' score which indicates level of hypnotizability. The Spiegels hypothesized that the eye-roll sign is a manifestation of the way the brain hemispheres interrelate, and serve as a 'biological marker'  of  hypnotizability.  The  HIP  takes  only  a  few  minutes  to  administer,  and  the Spiegels suggest the test can even become the induction for therapeutic work in hypnosis, thereby giving a more flowing element to the clinical interaction. Curiously, however, the\nHIP  does  not  correlate  significantly  with  the  SHSS  or  the  HGSHS:A.  Despite  that,  it remains a popular instrument for its convenience, short duration, and clinical foundation.",

        "text": "As  mentioned  above,  most  clinicians  do  not  employ  formal  instruments  for  assessing hypnotizability, for reasons ranging from they 'feel' artificial, or they don't want to set up  'pass-fail'  situations  needlessly,  to  the  belief  they  don't  reveal  useful  clinical information. Psychologist Brent Geary (2001) summed up this viewpoint when he wrote,\n(my)  premise  is  that  everyone  with  intact  mental  processes  can  benefit  from hypnosis to some degree. The extent to which this is possible is tested through clinical  intervention  rather  than  by  the  administration  of  a  set  procedure  that yields  a  quantifiable  result…the  primary  context  for  assessment…remains  the patient's ongoing narrative and responsiveness in the psychotherapeutic relationship (p. 3).\nNot unlike Weitzenhoffer's comment that, 'Either the effect can be done when the time comes or it cannot' (2000, p. 466), Geary and other clinicians prefer to observe responses as  they  unfold  in  the  'real  life'  context  of  the  therapy. Responsiveness is thus seen as existing  in  the  context  of  the  interaction  rather  than  as  a  function  of  some  innate characteristic of the client. What are some ways to assess responsiveness from this more informal  perspective,  that  is,  besides  the  formal  standardized  tests  already  described? Some  people  use  structured  'mini-tests'  such  as  the  Chevreul's  Pendulum,  the  'Hot Object,'  and  the  'Hand  Clasp,'  described  next.  But  the  'Embedded  Commands'  and 'Nonverbal Shifts,' described after the 'mini-tests,' are the kind of nonintrusive forms of assessment that Geary referred to above.",

        "text": "If you have ever played with a Ouija board, you've experienced the Chevreul's Pendulum test.  This  is  a  structured  'mini-test'  administered  before  formal  hypnosis  as  a  simple means of helping the client get 'acquainted with hypnotic-like responding' (Bates, 1993, p. 40). A pendulum is given to the subject with the instruction to hold the chain between thumb and forefinger (Coe, 1993; Watkins, 1987). The process can be made a bit more dramatic by having the subject hold the pendulum over the center of a circle containing intersecting lines drawn on a piece of paper. The circle may look like this:\nThe vertical axis was labeled 'Y' arbitrarily to stand for our cultural head nod to respond 'Yes.'  Likewise,  I  arbitrarily  labeled  the  horizontal  axis  'N'  to  stand  for  our  cultural\nhead shake to respond 'No.'\nOnce the subject has the pendulum dangling over the center of the circle, suggestions such  as  the  following  can  be  given:  'As  you  relax  by  breathing  deeply,  you  can concentrate  on  holding  the  pendulum  still…that's  right…and  now  as  you  continue  to concentrate you'll notice and allow the pendulum to take on a particular motion.' Notice the  lack  of  specificity  about  what  motion  the  pendulum  is  to  take.  As  you  observe  the pendulum  begin  to  move,  you  can  then  begin  to  use  suggestions  to  amplify  the movement: 'That's right…the pendulum can begin to swing more and more along the (N, Y) axis, from (left to right or to and fro), and it can do so without you really knowing how  or  why…the  pendulum  can  move  just  by  your  concentrating  on  it,  and  you  can concentrate on letting it swing wider and wider without any effort on your part….' Then you can further suggest stopping it and switching directions to the other axis. The greater the degree of the pendulum's swing, the greater the degree of suggestibility.\nAs hokey as this old test may seem, it does illustrate well the transderivational search and ideomotor processes first discussed in chapter 3. As the client processes the meaning of  'left  to  right'  or  'toward  you  and away from you,' his or her body responds to the mental meaning and causes small muscle movements (called the 'ideomotor response') outside of consciousness which cause the pendulum to move. Because the person's small muscle movements causing the pendulum's swing are unconscious, the pendulum test is often a genuine surprise to the client and thus serves as a convincer of his or her hypnotic skills-and yours as well.",

Suggestions might be given that the object has been treated with a special chemical, or is perhaps plugged into an electrical outlet, and that it will begin to heat up and get hotter and hotter until it becomes too hot to hold. (I  have  a  video  clip  of  Ernest  Hilgard  demonstrating  this  in  his  Stanford  lab  with  a woman he hands an ordinary ballpoint pen to while she focuses her gaze elsewhere. He tells her it is a 'heating element' that he is going to plug into the wall. He instructs her to tell him when it starts to get warm, which she readily does. Then he tells her it will get hot, too hot to hold, and drop it when it does. She breathes heavily trying to hold on as long as she can before she drops the pen. She had the subjective experience of the pen getting  too  hot  to  hold!)

        "text": "One of the subtests of the Stanford Scale, one that involves a challenge to the client to perform,  the  client  is  asked  to  sit  comfortably,  hands  together  and  fingers  interlaced. Some suggestions are offered about his or her hands being (tied, glued…) stuck together, coupled  with  suggestions  that  'the  harder  you try to  pull  your  hands  apart,  the  more\ntightly stuck together they become.'\nThere is a play on words in this mini-test. It concerns the difference between 'trying' and  'doing.'  Trying  implies  expending  energy,  but  not  actually  'doing.'  The  key suggestion for this and other similarly structured tests is phrased, 'The harder you try to (pull your hands apart, bend your arm, open your eyes), the more difficult it will be to do so.' The tendency for literalism is what allows this technique to work (when it does). The next step then is providing the suggestions that 'In just a moment I'll ask you to separate your hands (bend your arm, open your eyes) and let them drop into your lap…and you'll be able to do so quite easily, quite effortlessly… Now go ahead and separate your hands and let them drop slowly to your lap.' Notice the difference between the 'try' challenge mode versus the 'do' mode.\nAnother variable in this and each of the challenge tests is the amount of time you give the person to 'try.' Let the person make the initial effort, find it takes more energy than expected, and then give him or her the suggestion to 'stop trying now and just continue to relax.' If you give the person more than a few seconds to feel that initial effort, of course he or she can eventually do what you've suggested couldn't be done. Be quick to let him or her stop trying!\nThe three informal tests described above are commonly used, structured ones that are obviously quite arbitrary and ritualistic in terms of the demands they make on the client. There are other, more spontaneous approaches to assessing suggestibility as well, two of which are described below.",

By  being  components  of  a  larger  context,  they  are suggestive but do not stand out as such and can more easily therefore escape conscious detection. For example, if I use my voice to accent (i.e., emphasize) slightly (e.g., through a change of voice tone or volume) the underlined words as I say the following sentences, I can embed suggestions for specific responses:\n'Isn't it nice to… close your eyes …at the end of the day?' (I may get the eye closure response, an obvious indicator of suggestibility) 'I thought to myself I could… take a deep breath …and think it over.' 'You can… scratch the itch …to succeed.'\nIf you offer a suggestion so indirectly and the person takes a deep breath or scratches an itch, you have a positive response. Any suggestion that's embedded has the potential to get  a  response:  More  spontaneous,  less  imposing  and  arbitrary  than  challenge  tests  or gimmicks  like  a  pendulum,  embedded  commands  can  be  a  more  useful  indicator  of suggestibility because of their subtlety.",

Part of attaining rapport is the 'pacing' or 'mirroring' of client behaviors\noutside  of  their  consciousness.  Nonverbal  shifts  can  take  place  in  many  behaviors: posture, gestures, scratching, eye contact, and breathing, just to name a few. If you mirror a client's body posture and then shift your posture and your client shifts at that moment also, you have evidence of rapport and suggestibility at an unconscious level. In one of my clinical demonstrations available on video, The Case of Mike (see Appendix B, page 563,  for  information  about  this  session),  as  I  orient  Mike  to  hypnosis,  I  unconsciously lean back and cross my legs. Just two seconds later he does exactly the same! I knew at that  moment that  the  rapport  (i.e.,  connection)  between  us  would  likely  help  make  the session useful to him, which follow-up shows it was.\nMirroring someone is effective  only to  the  degree  that  it  remains  out  of  the  client's consciousness. If perceived consciously, it's no longer called pacing; rather, it's called mimicking,  and  rapport  will  be  lost.

There are the matters of timing (i.e., when in the relationship it is introduced), the explanation of a test's role in treatment, the style in which you offer it, your response to the client's response (or lack thereof), and how you end it and move on to the next phase of interaction.\nSome clinicians use suggestibility tests right away-even before the person's problem is  presented,  even  before  rapport  is  attained.  I  adamantly  discourage  that  practice,  but still, it's what some people do. To my way of thinking, rapport is essential and must be earned through clinical skill.\nThe suggestibility test should generally not be introduced to the client as a 'test.' The word  'test'  has  immediate  implications  of  a  'pass  or  fail'  situation,  and  can  raise  an already  uncomfortable  client's  anxiety  level  even  higher.  I  suggest  you  call  them 'responsiveness measures' or even 'conditioning experiences.' The idea of a pass or fail situation is a legitimate objection to the use of suggestibility tests, especially those that directly challenge the client in some way. To demand a specific response from someone is to run the risk of not getting it. Why set a client up to fail? My emphasis is on your role of  suggesting  possibilities,  but  respecting  the  client's  final  choice  as  to  whether  the suggestion is accepted or rejected. With suggestibility tests, challenging clients to have a certain suggested experience doesn't much respect their ability to choose for themselves.",

        "text": "If you enthusiastically recommend a restaurant you recently tried and enjoyed to a friend, and then he or she goes to that restaurant solely on the basis of your recommendation, you have clearly influenced his or her experience. Somewhere in that interaction was at least one basic element of hypnosis: you offered a suggestion, and it was accepted and later acted upon. How exactly did you phrase your recommendation? What was your tone of voice and body posture? What is your relationship with that person? Why was he or she  receptive  to  your  recommendation?  What  other  factors  can  you  identify  that  made your recommendation the basis for a new experience for someone?\nSuggesting  to  someone  that  he  or  she  go  to  a  particular  restaurant  or  movie  (or likewise,  that  he  or  she  avoid  it)  is  a  routine,  everyday  type  of  interaction.  Despite  its commonness, this kind of interaction can illustrate the nature of suggestion quite well. In making a recommendation of any sort, you are sharing information with someone about an experience you've had or a belief you hold. On the basis of your description, the other person  forms  an  internal representation of your  experience  (i.e., perhaps  vividly imagining what the restaurant looked like, what the atmosphere was like, how the service was, how the presentation of the food was, how the food tasted, etc.). If it is a powerful enough  representation,  it  may  motivate  him  or  her  to  seek  out  and  have  a  similar experience directly. In this example, sensory information about a restaurant is transmitted from one person to another, but the information does not have to be acted upon since it is only a recommendation or suggestion, not a command. If the information is inherently appealing,  or  is  made  to  sound  appealing  in  some  way  to  the  listener,  then  it  is  more likely to be accepted. Any suggestion can be accepted or rejected, hypnotic or otherwise. The  power  of  hypnotic  communication,  i.e.,  communication  that  absorbs  the  person's attention and directs their experience, is in its ability to act as a catalyst for organizing and using more of the client's resources, both conscious and unconscious. The ritualistic nature  of  traditional  hypnotic  inductions  is  a  good  example  of  a  specific  means  for occupying a person's conscious mind, allowing the unconscious to be more accessible for",

The  person  in  hypnosis  isn't  unaware  of  the  suggestions,  of course, but is able to respond more experientially and multidimensionally.\nThe skill of an effective hypnotist is in his or her ability to formulate suggestions in such a way as to make them both acceptable and usable . Merely performing an induction of hypnosis is not sufficient: A deep hypnotic experience on the part of the client is no assurance that he or she will accept offered suggestions, even ones that are clearly in his or  her  best  interest  to  accept.  As  you  learned  in  previous  chapters,  numerous  personal, interpersonal,  and  situational  factors  ultimately  determine  the  degree  of  a  person's responsiveness to suggestion. The focus in this chapter is on some of the communication variables  of  hypnotic  patterns,  specifically  the  range  of  communication  styles  and structures that can be used to form hypnotic suggestions. There are many different ways of communicating an idea to someone, and so the clinician can be deliberate in choosing a  means  of  organizing  and  delivering  a  suggestion  that  carries  the  greatest  chance  of being accepted by the client.\nSuggestions are dynamic, not static in their structure. They can range along a number of  continua,  sharing  multiple,  simultaneous  traits.  There  is  no  time  when  all  your suggestions will fit into only one category, nor will there be any time you won't want to move  up  and  down  on  a  particular  continuum  of  suggestion  as  you  offer  a  series  of suggestions to someone. What are these continua? On one continuum of suggestion, we have direct and indirect suggestions  occupying the  poles.  On  a  second  continuum,  we have  suggestions  ranging  from positive to negative .  On  a  third  continuum,  we  have process and content suggestions.  And  on  the  fourth  and  last  continuum  we  have possibilities  ranging  from permissive to authoritarian suggestions.  In  a  related  but separate category are posthypnotic suggestions, an essential and well-\nTable 2.

        "text": "Direct suggestions deal with the problem at hand or the specific response desired overtly\nand  clearly.  Direct  suggestions  provide  specific  directions  as  to  how  to  respond. Consequently, they are not known for their  subtlety.  The  generic  structure  for  a  direct suggestion  is,  'You  can  do  X.'  The  form  of  a  direct  suggestion  can  vary  within  this generic structure, depending on your specific word choice.\nTo initiate the hypnosis session, the clinician will typically suggest that the client close his or her eyes. If the clinician chooses a direct approach, he or she might offer any of the following direct suggestions:\nClose your eyes. Please close your eyes. You can close your eyes. Let your eyes close.\nI would like you to close your eyes now.\nEach of these suggestions directly relates  to  obtaining  eye  closure  from  the  client  as  a specific response. There is no mistaking what the clinician wants the client to do. The statements  are  clear  in  their  intent  to  get  the  client  to  close  his  or  her  eyes.  The  same direct suggestion structures, by changing their content (i.e., associated details) might be used to obtain virtually any desired response:\nYou can go back in your memory and remember when you went to your first school dance. (Age regression)\nI want you to let your arm lift effortlessly and become weightless. (Sensory alteration and arm levitation)\nYou  will  be  able  to  make  your  hand  numb  in  the  next  few  seconds. (Analgesia)\nExperience each minute as if it were an hour. (Time distortion)\nThe  desired  response  in  each  of  these  examples  is  apparent  because  the  suggestions directly ask for it. Nothing is hidden from the client in terms of what is wanted from him or  her.  Each  suggestion  is  intended  to  generate  a  specific  response.  Additional  direct suggestions may then be offered in order to provide a concrete means (i.e., a strategy) for accomplishing the suggested response:\nImagine you are in a time machine that is taking you back to your first school dance.\nYou can feel that your arm is tied to a large helium balloon  allowing it to float.\nRemember how your hand tingles when you get a shot of novocaine? You can have that same sensation of numbness in your hand now.\nTime passes so slowly when you are waiting for something special, and you can notice now how slowly the hands of time move.\nMany clinicians employ a direct suggestion approach to hypnosis almost exclusively. For\nmany, it was simply the way they were trained and so it's what they're comfortable with. Some have difficulty evolving the flexibility it takes to vary their communication style even though they perceive it might be beneficial to do so. Others haven't seen the need to evolve any other style besides a direct one because they haven't seen any evidence for other styles being either as effective or more effective than a straightforward style. The issue of one style being 'better' than another is one of the lingering controversies in the field, and I will address it directly later in this section.\nTraining  courses  and  books  that  offer  standardized  'one-size-fits-all'  scripts  for  use with  general  problems  are  typically  direct  in  their  approach.  They  employ  suggestions that  represent  a  frontal  assault  on  the  presenting  problem.  For  example,  if  a  client presents  the  complaint  of  wanting  to  lose  weight,  a  direct  approach  might  offer suggestions such as:\nYou  want  to  lose  weight,  and  you  will  lose  weight.  You  will  lose  weight seemingly effortlessly because you will find yourself becoming choosier about what you eat and when you eat. Whenever you reach for either a fattening or unnecessary  food  you  will  instantly  see  the  detailed  image  in  your  mind  of yourself weighing your ideal weight, and it will feel so good and so motivating to  you  that  you  will  find  it  much  easier  to  choose  not  to  overeat.  You  would rather lose weight than eat fattening foods. You will feel so good about yourself in  this  process  that  losing  weight  becomes  easier  and  easier,  and  you'll  find yourself being satisfied with less and less food. You'll feel extra energy as you lose weight and so you will also want to exercise more just to use your extra energy to get leaner and stronger….\nThis kind of direct approach may work with some people-perhaps some very obedient, highly hypnotizable, and deeply motivated ones! It's not that such suggestions are bad, wrong, or destined to fail. In fact, for someone who wants to lose weight, they will have to do as suggested, that is, eat less and exercise more. But, that's the equivalent of telling a depressed person to 'Cheer up!' It's correct, but not particularly effective. (I regularly encounter people who would rather be right than effective. That puzzles me.) For most people, more subtlety and less of an 'in-your-face' approach is preferred. Supportive and not merely demanding suggestions are required, as well as a more highly individualized approach  acknowledging  the  person  as  special  in  some  way,  which  each  person  is. Telling  others  bluntly  what  to  do  does  not  show  much  clinical  skill,  nor  does  it  show much respect for their intelligence and creativity. People typically already know what to do,  they  just  don't  have  access  to  the  resources  that  would  allow  them  to  do  it. (Realistically, do you think there's an overweight person out there who doesn't already know  he  or  she  should  eat  less  and  exercise  more?)  Finally,  such  approaches  don't involve  as  much  of  the  person  in  the  therapy  process  as  a  more  collaborative  effort would. Thus, direct suggestions can be greatly helpful, but familiarity and skill with both direct  and  indirect  approaches  are  essential  to  the  development  of  a  broad  and  flexible practice of clinical hypnosis.\nHere is an abbreviated 'cost-benefit' analysis of direct suggestions: The advantages of direct  suggestions  include:  (1)  their  direct  relevance  to  the  matters  at  hand  (easing\nconcerns in the client about your ability to deal directly with his or her problems); (2) their  ability  to  keep  the  client's  goal(s)  well  defined  and  in  sight;  (3)  their  direct involvement of the client in the process in an active way; and, (4) their ability to serve as a  model  for  the  resolution  of  this  and  any  future  problems  that  arise  through  the development of a deliberate problem-solving strategy.\nThe disadvantages of direct suggestions include: (1) their over-reliance on a conscious willingness  to  follow  suggestions,  making  less  use  of  unconscious  resources;  (2)  their greater likelihood of engendering resistance in the client by dealing so directly and even bluntly  with  his  or  her  problems,  potentially  a  threatening  experience;  and,  (3)  their defining the client's  role  primarily  as  one  of  mere  compliance  rather  than  an  as  active participant in the therapy.\nAppreciating  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  the  use  of  direct  suggestions  is necessary to allow you to make an informed decision as to when their use will most likely result in a successful hypnotic experience.",

        "text": "Indirect suggestions relate to the problem at hand or the specific desired response in a covert  (or,  at  least,  less  obvious)  and  unobtrusive  way.  They  can  be  quite  subtle  and thereby  escape  a  full  awareness  and  analysis.  Such  suggestions  usually  do  not  relate directly to the person's conscious experience. Rather, they are indirectly related and thus require the client to interpret them in a proactive and idiosyncratic way in order to make meaning of them. The generic structure of an indirect suggestion is, 'I knew someone who experienced doing X.' By talking about someone else (or some other situation), the response is invited through an indirect means. Use of indirect suggestions can have the client wondering at a conscious level what you are talking about, or perhaps may simply occupy (amuse, entertain, fascinate) the person at a conscious level, while at the same time  unconscious  associations  are  generated  that  can  pave  the  way  for  change  to  take place.\nConsider as an easy example a child's fairy tale: When you tell a child the story of The Three Little Pigs, the child can easily be entertained and fascinated by the drama of the story  and  by  the  playful  exchange  when  you  both  'huff  and  puff  and  blow  the  house down.' But, beneath the content of the story (i.e., the characters and the things they say to each other), there is a deeper message you hope to impart: The importance of planning, discipline, and hard work in order to move through life choosing substance (i.e., houses of  brick)  over  'flash'  (i.e.,  flimsy  ones  made  of  wood and straw). People  can transmit and receive deeper messages of substance through such indirect paths. We don't have to experience something directly in order to be influenced by it. Clinically speaking, every time  someone  provides  you  a  successful  case  example,  you  may  be  interested  in  and become absorbed in the details of the case, but the inescapable yet indirect message to you is, 'When you see this type of client, you can use this kind of an approach.'\nIndirect suggestions can take numerous forms, including storytelling, analogies, jokes, puns, homework assignments, role modeling, and disguised and embedded suggestions. Any communication device that causes or requires the client to respond without directly telling or asking him or her to do so involves some degree of indirect suggestion.\nThe use of indirect suggestion is a focal point of study in the 'utilization approach' to hypnosis, largely due to the many creative ways they were used by Milton H.Erickson, M.D.  Erickson  was  widely  acknowledged  for  his  skill  and  creativity  in  formulating successful interventions, often with seemingly 'impossible' clients. When you read his fascinating and unusual cases, many of which he described in his own words in the book, A Teaching Seminar with Milton H.Erickson, M.D. (Zeig, 1980), many of his ingenius hypnotic  and  strategic  interventions  seemed  to  have  absolutely  no  relationship  to  the presenting  complaint,  so  indirect  were  they.  Yet,  his  therapeutic  effectiveness  with hypnosis  and  indirect  suggestions  has  inspired  intensive  analysis  of  his  methods  and forced  an  appreciation  for  the  merits  of  indirect  approaches  in  the  field  when  others succeed  similarly  using  his  methods.  Thus,  an  advanced  study  of  clinical  hypnosis  is literally  impossible  without  studying  Erickson's  work  directly,  as  well  as  the  writings about  his  methods  by  his  many  students  and  colleagues  (including  Erickson,  Rossi,  & Rossi, 1976; Erickson & Rossi, 1979, 1981; Gilligan, 1987, Haley, 1973, 1985; Lankton &  Lankton,  1983;  O'Hanlon,  1987;  O'Hanlon  &  Hexum,  1990;  Rosen,  1982;  Rossi, 1980, and many others).\nTo contrast direct and indirect suggestions, you can refer back to the previous section's examples  for  obtaining  eye  closure  through  direct  suggestions.  If  you  suspect,  on  the basis  of  feedback  from  your  client,  that  you  would  be  more  likely  to  get  eye  closure through indirect methods, you might offer any of the following suggestions:\nA responsive client usually begins the hypnotic experience by closing his or her eyes.\nCan you allow your eyes to close?\nMany of my clients like to sit there with their eyes closed.\nIsn't it nice not to have to listen with your eyes open?\nI wonder what you will think of that will allow you to comfortably close your eyes .\nEach of these examples seeks eye closure as a specific response, but it has never been asked for directly. The statements are general ones that the client must respond to in some way since even no response is a response. The clinician can learn quite a bit about how the person thinks and responds from the way he or she relates to such suggestions. For example, does the person take initiative in responding, or simply wait to be told exactly what to do?\nOne pattern of indirection may take the form of simply describing others' experiences, allowing  the  client  to  choose  a  similar  response  or  else  generate  an  independent  one. Another  indirect  pattern  is  to  have  the  client  become  aware  of  routine,  everyday experiences where the desired response is a natural event. As the client becomes focused on and associated to such a situation, he or she can begin to re-experience it himself or herself as if in that suggested situation. The responses associated with the past experience can become a part of the current experience. For example, if you were to think of a time when you felt very romantic and loving toward someone, and really spent time recalling the details of that experience, those same feelings are likely to arise now through your recall  (an  ideoaffective  response).  Thus,  instead  of  demanding  the  specific  response  of\ncreating  those  feelings  now  in  a  direct  way,  I  can  get  them  less  directly  by  simply describing a context where such feelings are likely to naturally occur.\nAs with eye closure, indirect suggestions can be varied in content to obtain virtually any response:\nA close friend of mine has a daughter who went to her first school dance, and I don't know if you can remember yours, but it sure was an exciting time for her. (Age regression)\nWhen you were in grade school you had to raise your hand slowly when you wanted to say something important, and sometimes it would rise as if it were weightless and you didn't even realize it. (Sensory alteration and arm levitation) Can you imagine what it's like to have a barehanded snowball fight and have so much fun making and throwing snowballs you forgot to notice you weren't\neven wearing gloves? (Analgesia)\nTime is so difficult to keep track of, and after all a minute can seem like 5 or 10  minutes  sometimes;  you've  had  that  experience,  where  you  can  get  so wrapped  up  in  your  thoughts  that  only  a  minute  can  seem  so  much  longer. (Time distortion)\nIn each of the above examples, the client's immediate experience is seemingly less the focal point than someone else's, or the suggestion seems so general as to be impersonal and therefore not requiring a direct response. It is up to the client to adapt herself in her own  unique  way  to  the possibilities for  certain  responses  raised  by  the  clinician's suggestion. In this way, direct commands for obedience are avoided, and the client's own creative ability to form an individualized response is tapped. How he or she finds a way to accomplish the possible response suggested is as varied and creative as are people. My strategies for getting the response may not be as useful to the person as the possibilities he or she creates for him or herself. Essentially, through the telling of stories or some similar indirect technique, I am  suggesting  to  the  person  that a change  can  be accomplished without telling the person 'what' to do, inviting his or her participation in the creation of a solution.\nHere,  then,  is  an  abbreviated  'cost-benefit'  analysis  of  indirect  suggestions:  The advantages of the indirect approaches include: (1) their greater utilization of unconscious resources in the client's own behalf; (2) their greater distance between the suggestion and its intended target emotion or behavior, reducing the need for resistant defenses; (3) their permissiveness  in  encouraging  and  allowing  the  client  to  interpret  the  suggestions  in whatever  way  might  be  useful  to  him  or  her,  demonstrating  a  greater  respect  for  the client; and, (4) their defining the client's role in the treatment process as an active one going beyond mere compliance.\nThe disadvantages of the indirect style include: (1) the client's possible fear or anxiety that  the  clinician  is  either  unable or unwilling to deal directly with his or her problem, and  'if  he  or  she  can't,  how  can I? ';  (2)  the  clinician  may  be  viewed  as  evasive  or incompetent (i.e., seemingly irrelevant in 'talking around' issues), and the client may feel manipulated  and  even  cheated;  (3)  the  client's  unconscious  responses  may  allow  for alleviation  of  the  problem,  but  may  leave  him  or  her  consciously  wondering  how  the\nchange occurred, as if therapy was done 'to' rather than 'with' him or her; and, (4) the problem may be solved but may not leave the client with a knowledge of and access to effective and self-managed patterns for solving future problems.\nAs  with  direct  suggestions,  appreciating  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  using indirect suggestions gives you an ability to make  sensitive choices about their applications. One approach is not better than another. The goal is to use either approach flexibly in order to get the desired therapeutic result.",

        "text": "One  of  the  ongoing  debates  within  the  field  concerns  the  issue  of  which  form  of suggestion,  direct  or  indirect,  is  clinically  superior.  There  have  been  numerous  studies attempting  to  answer  the  question,  and,  as  one  might  expect,  they  differ  in  their conclusions (Barber, 1980; Fricton & Roth, 1985; Groth-Marnat & Mitchell, 1998; Hayes & Gifford, 1997; Lynn, Neufeld, & Mare, 1993; Yapko, 1983). Such research misses an obvious  point: No  suggestion  is  inherently  worth  much;  a  suggestion  only  becomes meaningful  when  a  client  accepts,  integrates,  and  responds  meaningfully  to  it. Thus, generalizations about the superiority of one form of suggestion over another may, at best, be academically interesting, but they have little bearing on what an individual client will respond  well  to.  Thus,  if  you  only  know  how  to  be  direct,  you  will  be  at  a  distinct disadvantage  when  you  encounter  those  clients  who  will  respond  better  to  less  direct approaches. The most sensible goal is to be fluent in all suggestive approaches and vary them as circumstances warrant.\nFor many experts in the field, the recommendation on this issue is to formally assess hypnotizability, and use the client's profile ('low,' 'medium,' or 'high' hypnotizable) to determine  whether  you  should  even  do  hypnosis.  The  more  hypnotizable  the  person, generally speaking, the more you can be direct in your methods.\nThere  are  others,  though,  myself  included,  who  are  less  interested  in  scores  on  a standardized  test  and  who  are  more  interested  in  other  factors  that  influence  hypnotic responsiveness. Alternative guidelines for choosing a style, and the degree to which that style should be used, are based on two major factors: the degree of insight desirable or necessary  to  allow  the  intervention  to  work,  and  the  degree  of  responsiveness  of  the client.\nThere  exists  a  split  among  psychotherapists  regarding  the  role  of  insight  in  the treatment  process.  Some claim that  insight  is  both  necessary  and  desirable  to  facilitate change. Others claim insight is not required in order for meaningful changes to occur and that insight may even delay change by giving people a better cognitive understanding of the  hurtful  patterns,  fueling  the  defense  of  'intellectualization,'  with  no  vehicle  for affectively or behaviorally changing them.\nIt seems there are few, if any, absolute 'right' or 'wrong' ways to structure therapeutic interventions.  Rather,  there  are  ways  that  are  effective  and  ineffective  with  specific clients,  and  it  grows  ever  more  obvious  from  diverse  yet  successful  interventions  that there are many 'right' ways. Each client is unique as an individual, and whether insight\nwill work for or against the therapy is a factor to weigh in formulating your interventions. Some  clients  demand  understanding  what  you're  doing  on  a  conscious  level,  asking 'Why?' a lot. Others are much more interested in getting some change to occur in the problem no matter what it takes. The more a person seeks conscious understanding and tries  to  engage you on that level, the more an indirect approach may disrupt his or her normal pattern, increasing the likelihood of change. Yet, at the same time, a person who seeks conscious understanding may be put off by an indirect method, lose patience and motivation,  and  then  dismiss  the  experience  as  useless.  Only  clinical  experience  will teach you to make skilled assessments about which style to use with a particular client.\nThe second variable to consider in assessing whether to use a direct or indirect style is the  degree  of  responsiveness  of  the  client  (or,  conversely,  the  degree  of  'resistance,' traditionally  considered  a  lack  of  responsiveness).  A  basic  guideline  you  can  use  to determine  which  style  to  use  is  this:  The  degree  of  indirection  should  be  directly proportional to the degree of resistance encountered or anticipated (Zeig, 1980). In other words, the greater the degree of inability or unwillingness to follow directives on the part of  the  client,  the  more  the  suggestions  should  be  offered  indirectly.  If  a  client  is compliant  with  and  highly  responsive  to  the  clinician's  requests,  following  them  in  an authentic (and not in a 'resistant over-cooperation') and positively motivated way, then indirection  is  not  necessary.  Conversely,  if  a  client  is  resistant  to  directives,  is  selfdirected  (i.e.,  following  his  or  her  own  agenda  despite  your  recommendations),  then indirect  approaches  are  more  respectful  and  nonthreatening.  Their  distance  from  the intended target (such as the underlying dynamics to be resolved) may well increase the likelihood of their acceptance.\nIn  sum,  the  degree  of  direction  or  indirection  in  offering  suggestions  will  vary according  to  the  unique  responses  of  each  individual  you  work  with.  As  with  all  the hypnotic  communication  patterns  presented  in  this  book,  what  you  do  at  any  given moment will  rely  on  the  feedback  you  get  from  the  client.  After  all,  he  or  she  is  the determinant of what works. You can feel much more secure in your abilities to relate to a wider range of people if you have both direct and indirect approaches in your repertoire.",

        "text": "The authoritarian style is a domineering one in which the clinician literally commands the client to respond in a particular way. The generic structure for an authoritarian style is, 'You will do X.' Authority and power are the key variables the clinician relies on, and the  response  from  the  'good'  client  is  compliance.  Stage  hypnotists,  as  an  exemplary group,  are  necessarily  authoritarian  in  style,  requiring  obedient  responses  from  their subjects. In the authoritarian approach, a lack of compliance is evidence of 'resistance,'\nand,  unfortunately,  is  viewed  as  a  shortcoming  of  the  client.  Literature  advocating authoritarian  styles  as  a  modus  operandi  typically  suggests  first  confronting  the  client about  his  or  her  resistance  to  the  procedures  and  then  attempting  to  eliminate  it  by identifying its source and means of resolution. In chapter 21 on non-ideal responses to hypnosis, the detriments of this approach to managing resistance are elaborated, but you may anticipate how easily this confrontive approach can initiate a 'power struggle.'\nAuthoritarian approaches involve offering suggestions in the form of commands. The following suggestions are structured in an authoritarian mode:\nClose your eyes when I count to three. (Eye closure) When I snap my fingers, you will be six years old. (Age regression) When I touch your shoulder, you will go into deep hypnosis. (Deepening) You will find it impossible to bend your arm. (Catalepsy) You will not remember anything from this experience. (Amnesia)\nDirecting someone to respond in a specific way that minimizes personal choice does not show  much  respect  for  that  person's  needs  or  wants.  Thus,  a  strictly  authoritarian approach  should  generally  be  used  sparingly.  There  are  times,  though,  when  such  an approach is not only viable, but even desirable: When a vulnerable and confused patient needs  a  clinician  who  is  clearly  in  charge  and  decisive,  and  when  the  quality  of  good rapport between you and the client makes what you have to say far more important than how diplomatically you say it.",

        "text": "At  the  other  end  of  the  continuum  is  the  'permissive'  style,  one  that  is  much  more respectful of the client's ability to make choices in his or her own behalf about what he or she  will  and  will  not  respond  to.  The  permissive  approach  is  one  characterized  by  its emphasis  on  allowing  the  client  to  become  aware  of  possibilities  for  meaningful responses, rather than making demands for such responses. The generic structure for the permissive suggestion is, 'You can do X.' The clinician offers suggestions of what the client may experience if he or she chooses to. The sensibility of a permissive approach is in  knowing  you  can't  make  someone  respond  (e.g.,  relax  or  focus).  You  can  simply suggest possibilities in  such  a  way  that  the  person,  hopefully,  chooses  to  avail  him-  or herself of those possibilities. Ultimately, the responsibility is on the client to make use of information that has been provided by the clinician in his or her own way. Any response is deemed an adequate or usable one by the clinician, respectful of the person's choice. In this  way,  'resistance'  is  much  less  debilitating  a  factor,  since  whatever  re-sponse  the person generates is deemed acceptable.\nPermissive  suggestions  are  intended  to  raise  the  possibility  of  a  response,  and  the following examples may illustrate the point:\nYou can allow your eyes to close, if you would like. (Eye closure) You may choose to uncross your legs. (Postural shift) You might be willing to let yourself relax even more deeply. (Deepening) It's possible to experience your body differently. (Perceptual shift)",

        "text": "Perhaps you can remember  a  time when  you  felt comfortable. (Age regression)\nIn  these  examples,  the  client  is  offered  choices  and  then  responds  to  his  or  her  own choices. The clinician is simply saying, in one form or another, that the client can have an experience if he or she permits it. The client's response in any direction is thus a choice and must be respected as such. Such acceptance by the clinician can add to the rapport by demonstrating a respect for the client as a person capable of making choices for him- or herself. It may be implicit thus far but can now be stated explicitly that when the client's choices are deemed counterproductive to your treatment plan, your strategy needs to be revised.  The  idea  of  the  permissive  approach  is  to  make  the  suggestions  you  offered clients acceptable through their personal choice. The skill required in such an approach is evident.\nIn sum, there are those who want to be told what to do and will follow instructions to the letter, and there are those who refuse to follow anyone's lead and will even go out of their way to reject others' input simply because they resist being 'controlled.' If someone is willing to follow directives obediently, an authoritarian approach may be successfully employed.  With  most  people,  however,  it  will  tend  to  set  up  'power  struggles.'  The permissive approach is good for creating possibilities in people who like to have a large measure of  control  in  their  lives  by  making  their  own  decisions,  but  may  frustrate  the person who wants to be told in explicit terms exactly what to do in a step-by-step fashion. Both authoritarian and permissive styles have their place in doing hypnosis, and as with all forms of suggestion, it will enhance your effectiveness when you familiarize yourself with their usage.",

        "text": "Positive suggestions are by far the most common, simple, and useful type of suggestion structure. Positive suggestions are supportive and encouraging, and are phrased in such a way as to give the client the idea that he or she can experience or accomplish something desirable.  The  generic  structure  for  a  positive  suggestion  is,  'You  can  do  X.'  (You'll recognize  this  as  a  permissive  suggestion  as  well.)  Since  words  call  to  mind  the experiences that the words (as symbols of experience) represent, positive suggestions are phrased to create desired responses. The following suggestions are structured in positive and permissive ways:\nYou can feel more comfortable with each breath you inhale. (Deepening)\nYou  can  remember  a  time  when  you  felt  very  proud  of  yourself.  (Age regression)\nYou are able to discover inner strengths you didn't realize you had. (Resource building)\nYou  can  notice  how  good  it  feels  to  relax.  (Deepening)  You  may  notice  a soothing feeling of warmth in your hands. (Sensory alteration)\nThese examples are positive suggestions to the client of things he or she can experience. These  suggestions  are  meant  to  be  empowering,  creating  positive  possibilities  without demanding  anything  specific  to  resist.  Amplifying  what's  possible,  meaningful,  and helpful is the foundation of positive suggestions.\nMany experienced clinicians claim that suggestions should be in the positive form in order  for  the  unconscious  mind  to  process  them,  and  it  is  further  claimed  that  the unconscious mind does not understand negatives. My own experience is consistent with these  views  for  reasons  I  will  elaborate  in  the  following  discussion  on  negative suggestion structures.",

        "text": "Negative  suggestions  employ  a  sort  of  'reverse  psychology'  approach  when  used skillfully.  Negative  suggestions  may  be  used  to  obtain  a  response  by  suggesting  the person not respond in the desired way. The generic structure for a negative suggestion is, 'You cannot do X.' By telling the person what not to do, he or she still has to process and interpret what you say, and the various subjective associations surface as he or she does so. When used deliberately and in a skilled way, negative suggestions can be most useful.\nThe  following  are  examples  of  negative  suggestions.  Notice  what  your  internal experience is as you slowly read each of them.\nDo not think of your favorite color.\nDo not allow yourself to wonder what time it is.\nI would suggest that you not notice that sensation in your leg.\nYou  shouldn't  be  thinking  about  your  high  school  sweetheart  right  now.\nPlease try not to notice which of your friends is the most materialistic.\nDid you find yourself doing what was suggested that you not do? If so, why? If you were able to avoid doing what you were instructed to, how did you accomplish this? Did you have  to  distract  yourself  with  some  other  thoughts?  Would  a  client  be  able  to  prevent herself from  following  the suggestion if he or she didn't know  about  negative suggestions?\nAll too often, negative suggestions are employed naïvely and accidentally, generating an unwanted response that may leave the practitioner wondering what went wrong. If a clinician  says  (with  great  sincerity  and  the  positive  intention  of  comforting  the  client), 'Don't worry about it, just put it out of your mind,' the client is most likely to still worry and think about 'it.' If a lawyer says to a jury, 'Don't think about the horrible crime my client committed. Instead judge him only as a scared, confused person,' it is a safe bet the jury has just recalled all the gory details of the crime and the feelings they have about it. Accidental outcomes as a result of non-selective use of negative suggestions can undo in a sentence what might have taken considerably longer to accomplish. Use them carefully!\nI mentioned in the previous section that many experts have formed the opinion that the unconscious is unable to respond or decipher negative suggestions in the literal way they are presented. Based on your experience of the examples of negative suggestions above, do you agree? If I ask you not to think of the taste of pizza, didn't you have to first think\nof it before erasing it from your mind in whatever way you might have done so? Your unconscious responds to a negative with a positive. How might negative suggestions be used deliberately to facilitate the experience of hypnosis? By suggesting to the client he or  she  not  do  the  things  you  actually  want  him  or  her  to  do  (assuming  the  appropriate client and situational variables), you are paving the way for the client to respond in a way that  can  only  be  defined  as  cooperative.  For  example,  if  I  say  to  my  client,  'Don't  let your  breathing  slow  down  as  you  listen  to  me,  or  else  your  muscles  might  relax,'  the client  can  now  respond  by  either  letting  his  or  her  breathing  slow  down  and  muscles relax, positive signs of the beginning of hypnosis, or he or she can continue in the current state,  essentially  complying  with  the  literal  suggestion,  a  cooperative  response.  Thus, either response is a cooperative one, directly or indirectly.\nOther examples may include negative suggestions such as:\nDon't even consider the possibility that there might be a positive way to solve this problem.\nThere's no reason why you should even think about how good it will feel to get this behind you.\nDon't sit in a comfortable position if you can help it. I'd prefer that you don't discover that you can relax here, at least not yet.\nNegative  suggestions  are  a  way  of  'short-circuiting'  resistances,  occupying  the  client with negativity while asking for positive responses indirectly. The typical response of the client is to ignore the negative and respond to the implicit positive suggestion.",

        "text": "Content  suggestions  contain  highly  specific  details describing  feelings, memories, thoughts,  or  fantasies  the  client  is  to  experience  during  hypnosis.  The  generic  content suggestion  structure  is,  'You  can  experience  this  (specified  sensation,  memory,  etc.).' Providing details that describe every dimension of the suggested experience can have the desired effect of assisting the client to have the experience more completely and therefore with a greater degree of absorption and clinical usefulness.\nExamples of content suggestions may include:\nThink of a red rose with soft, velvet petals you can lightly brush against your nose as you inhale its gentle, sweet fragrance.\nImagine being at the beach on a bright, clear day, feeling the sun warming\nyour skin, smelling the salt in the ocean breeze, and hearing the lapping of the waves upon the shore.\nCan you remember how pleasing it is to bite into a juicy, wet orange, how your mouth waters, how the juice feels as it runs all over your fingers, and how tart it tastes?\nEach of these examples provides specific details about exactly what you are to experience in thinking of a rose, the beach, and an orange. Perhaps those details allowed you to have the  suggested  experience  more  fully,  in  which  case  the  details  were  helpful  to  you. However,  these  examples  can  also  illustrate  a  potential  hazard  in  using  content-filled suggestions,  namely  that  the  details  I  directed  you  to  notice  may  not  be  the  ones  you would have chosen to focus on. Or, at their worst, they may even have been details that negated  the  experience  for  you.  If,  for  example,  when  I  said  'imagine  the  beach'  you recalled  a  negative  experience  you  had  at  the  beach,  or  if  you  have  never  experienced being  at  a  beach  in  your  life,  then  the  details  will  lead  you  to  a  negative  memory  or perplex you as to what I'm getting at (since there is no personal experience to relate to my suggestions) and be disruptive. The potential problem with content suggestions is simply this: The more details you provide, the greater the probability that something you say will contradict your client's experience. The end result is the client will sense that the clinician is not really 'with' him or her, and so is less likely to benefit from the experience.\nOn  the  other  hand,  when  you  offer  content  to  someone  and  the  details  you  suggest actually fit with his or her experience, the details will enhance the experience. One way to increase the fit  of  content  suggestions  is  to  notice  the  many  cues  the  client  continually provides (such as style of language, sensory-based terms he or she spontaneously uses in speaking, and details he or she provides of experiences during the interview you can feed back  later  during  hypnosis)  about  his  or  her  experience.  Another  possibility  is  to  do  a general  hypnosis  session  and  ask  for  direct  feedback  about  which  suggestions  helped deepen the client's involvement in the experience and which seemed less effective. Yet another solution is to use process suggestions instead of content suggestions, discussed in the next section.",

        "text": "In  contrast  to  the  details  provided  in  content  suggestions,  process  suggestions  provide minimal details at  most, encouraging the client to provide  his  or  her  own.  The  generic structure for a process suggestion is, 'You can have a specific experience.' In response to the  deliberate  ambiguity  in  the  suggestion,  the  client  projects  his  or  her  own  personal experiences and frame of reference into the suggestion in order to make meaning of it. Consequently,  process  suggestions  are  less  likely  to  contradict  the  experience  of  the client. For example, if I would like the client to imagine being in a relaxing place, instead of me choosing the beach as a specific place to focus on and then providing lots of details (content suggestions) about what it's like to be at the beach, I can simply suggest to my client  that  he  or  she  imagine  being somewhere relaxing.  I  don't  say  where  that  place might be, and so he or she can choose the specific place and which particular details of that place he or she would like to focus on. Process suggestions are so general in nature\nthat the client can project personal meaning into them and then relate to them in his or her own, individual way.\nIf you  read newspaper  horoscopes, you have a common  example  of  process suggestions. The observations and predictions are so nonspecific that they can apply to virtually anyone. The following paragraph is an example of the point:\nYou  are  a  person  who  likes  to  be  with  those  people  you  care  about,  but sometimes you prefer to just be left alone. Sometimes you get very frustrated with events in your life, and even lose your temper on occasion. You would like more people to appreciate you, and you often think you deserve to make more money than you do. Sometimes you think terrible things about people you really do care about and then feel guilty about it.\nI  think  the  above  represents  most  of  the  human  beings  on  the  planet,  but  did  you  find yourself silently agreeing and wondering, 'How did he know that?' Process instructions give clients the opportunity to use their own experience and details in the process, and therefore make what seems, at first glance, to be too general to be effective appear to be a highly individualized approach. As you will discover in your use of process suggestions, people  take  their  projections very seriously.  Even  for  something  as  silly  as  astrology, there are people who invest themselves in horoscopes as daily guides to action. People get even more serious when they project themselves into the big questions of life: Why are we here? What's the meaning of life? What happens after we die?\nThe following are examples of process suggestions:\nYou  can  have  a  particular  memory  from  childhood,  one  that  you  haven't thought about in a long, long time. (Age regression)\nYou  will  notice  a  certain  pleasant  sensation  in  your  body  as  you  sit  there comfortably. (Kinesthetic awareness)\nYou  may  become  aware  of  a  specific  sound  in  the  room.  (Auditory awareness)\nCan you remember that special time when you felt so good about yourself? (Age regression)\nNone  of  these  suggestions  specifies  anything-that  is,  they  do  not  say  which  specific memory,  sensation,  sound,  or  event  the  client  is  supposed  to  experience.  The  client chooses  that  aspect  of  the  experience  when  he  or  she  projects  a  response  to  the suggestion. Notice, though, the use of qualifiers such as 'particular,' 'certain,' 'specific,'  and  'special'  in  process  suggestions.  These  can  be  employed  to  have  the client sift all of his or her experience down to one particular one to focus upon. Which one  the person  chooses  is  the product  of an interaction between  conscious  and unconscious choices. Typically, the client wonders how you knew what he or she was experiencing, not realizing how general your suggestion was because of how specific it seemed!  The  use  of  process  suggestions  is  often  harder  to  master  because  of  the 'groping-in-the-dark' aspect to them. But, their ability to sidestep contradictions between the details the clinician provides  and  the  client's actual experience  makes  them imperative to learn to use well.\nProcess  suggestions  are  especially  valuable  in  doing  group  hypnosis  processes,  in which  the opportunity to carefully watch  each  individual's responses to content suggestions is virtually impossible. Using process suggestions of a general yet specificsounding nature allows each person in the group to have an entirely different experience in  response  to  a  single  set  of  suggestions.  Trying  to  make  a  group  of  people  share  a common, detailed experience is a set-up for failure. Thus, through process suggestions the diversity among people is acknowledged and encouraged.\nThe content versus process paradigm can be viewed in another way: Dealing with the details contained in the structure of an experience, or with the structure itself. Contentoriented therapies deal with details of the problem, while process-oriented therapies focus on the problem's structure. For example, many people seek out a certain type of person in a romantic relationship, one who fits some measure of desirability that may or may not be a  conscious  criterion.  So,  if  a  person  has  a  succession  of  intimate  relationships  with someone tall and dark-haired, who is a fashionable dresser, tight-lipped about feelings, and  domineering,  and  each  time  the  relationship  ends  in  disaster,  then  what  can  be concluded?  People  have  patterns  that  guide  their  behavior,  and  these  are  generally unconscious. In the current example, the content is each specific person in the succession of  partners.  The  names  and  faces  change,  but  not  the  structure  of  how  a  relationship partner  is  chosen,  that  is,  the  type  of  person  in  the  pattern.  The  content  approach  to therapy might deal with the reason(s) why this particular relationship isn't working out, while a process approach might consider the structure of the pattern for how partners are chosen.  By  altering  the  structure  of  the  pattern  of  selection,  a  change  in  the  details (content) must naturally follow.\nUsing process or content suggestions is simply another choice point for the clinician in formulating  an  intervention.  Shifting  spontaneously  from  one  suggestion  structure  to another is an easy thing to do, so the decision about which structure to use is by no means a final one, a 'sink-or-swim' proposition. If what you are doing isn't getting the desired response, then flexibly making a midstream shift in your approach is a good idea.",

Posthypnotic suggestions make  it  possible  for  the  person  to  carry  over  into  the  desired  context  whatever  new associations he or she has acquired during hypnosis.\nPosthypnotic suggestions are a necessary part of the therapeutic process if the client is to carry new possibilities into future experiences. Without them, the learnings acquired during hypnosis will most probably be limited to the session itself. The reason for this is that hypnotic responses are generally 'trance state-specific,' meaning they are tied to the immediacy  of the hypnotic experience, operating within the boundaries of that\nexperience.  Posthypnotic  suggestions  permit  the  learnings  acquired  during  hypnosis  to cross internal boundaries and become available in other locations and frames of mind. If the  client  can  only  have  the  desired  experience  (e.g.,  pain  relief)  during  hypnosis,  the value  of  hypnosis  is  limited.  Its  value  increases  exponentially  when  new  resources  are extended across contexts. Posthypnotic suggestions facilitate that possibility. Posthypnotic suggestion might involve suggesting to the client that when he or she finds him- or herself in a particular situation he or she has had trouble with, or when he or she has  unwanted  hurtful  feelings,  he  or  she  can  take  some  specific  step  suggested  during hypnosis to remedy the problem. The following are examples of posthypnotic suggestions:\nWhen you come out of hypnosis in a few moments, you can enjoy the feeling that you rested to a more satisfying degree than you have in a long, long time.\nWhen you begin to take your examination next week, you can close your eyes for a moment that can seem much longer and take a deep breath, and you can notice all the anxiety leaving you as you exhale.\nAfter you go home tonight, you'll have a certain memory that will make you laugh, and it'll feel really good to let off some steam in such an enjoyable way.\nWhen you find yourself in the next argument with your boss, the feeling of comfort that she can disagree with you but still appreciate you will soothe you enough to handle the discussion calmly in a way you feel proud of.\nEach of these examples suggests a behavior or feeling the client is to experience in some future time and place to be based on the suggestions given to him or her during hypnosis. Interestingly,  some  clients  may  have  no  conscious  memory  for  the  origin  of  the suggestion (amnesia), but act on it unconsciously nonetheless.\nPosthypnotic suggestions can be used to facilitate future hypnotic work by offering the suggestion that in future sessions the client can experience hypnosis even more deeply and  rapidly.  Wherever  you  want  to  facilitate  'carryover,'  you'll  employ  posthypnotic suggestions.\nPosthypnotic  suggestions  are  essential  to  assure  that  the  desired  response  will  likely become  integrated  into  the  person's  everyday  life,  replacing  dysfunctional  or  absent responses.",

More than rhetorical questions, accessing questions  focus  the  client  on  particular  aspects  of  his  or  her  experience,  which  are amplified simply through the way the question was asked. In other words, the question suggests a response. For example: 'Can you recall how very soothing and relaxing it is to lie in the warm sun and feel it warming your skin?'

        "text": "Generally,  the  more  complicated  a  set  of  suggestions  or  instructions  you  provide  for someone  to  follow,  the  more  the  person  must  rely  on  conscious  resources  to  help understand and respond to them. That's true in or out of hypnosis. The more the person must rely on conscious resources, the less the person can respond with unconscious ones, partially  defeating  one  of  the  primary  reasons  for  even  doing  hypnosis.  Keeping  your suggestions  relatively  simple  allows  the  client  to  'go  with  the  flow'  of  the  process without having to critically, and therefore consciously, analyze, interpret, and judge the merits of your suggestions.\nTable 3. Some Helpful Hypnotic Communication Patterns\nKeeping your suggestions flowing smoothly and clearly is not as easy as you might think. I  have seen experienced hypnotists engender a lack of responsiveness in people just by making their directions too complex to follow. For example, in one case, a clinician did a group  hypnosis  process  involving  many  instructions  for  a  wide  variety  of  possible responses,  all  of  which  were  contingent  on  other  responses.  Observing  his  group's responses, I noticed many of the individuals had come out of hypnosis simply because the instructions were too complex, and the hurried pace did not match the stated intent of helping people relax. Some of the participants complained later that the suggestions were as confusing as some board game instructions ('Spin the wheel, and if an even number comes up,  you'll  throw  the  dice,  but  if  an  odd  number  comes  up  on  the  wheel  you'll choose one of three cards and if you choose the right card you'll have your choice of four numbers, one of which will be the correct number allowing you to match the…whew!'). It's too much work to try to follow complicated instructions, especially when someone is trying to relax, focus, and get some help.\nThe ideal hypnotic process is one that can elicit the desired responses in as brief yet easy  and  meaningful  a  way  as  possible.  The  more  the  person's  conscious  mind  is involved  in  trying  to  develop  unconscious  hypnotic  responses,  the  more  difficult  and lengthy the hypnosis session is likely to be. Essentially, it's like trying really hard to be spontaneous. Furthermore, depending on the person you're working with, too complex a\nprocess may turn him or her off not only to that session's work, but to future work as well.\nTo  complicate  matters, there is another  side of this guideline which  involves specialized  techniques  whose  value  is  derived  from  their  complexity  rather  than  from their simplicity. These advanced techniques include confusion and overload techniques, in which confusing ideas and an overabundance of information are provided deliberately. These techniques involve placing an excessive burden on the conscious mind to the point where it can no longer keep up. When the person eventually gives up trying to follow, he or  she  essentially  resigns  him-  or  herself  to  noncritically  allowing  the  experience  to unfold, ultimately becoming dissociated and permitting the unconscious mind to respond more independently.\nHow,  then,  do  you  know  whether  your  suggestions  are  too  complex  and  working against your goals? Observe your client's responses. Every suggestion that lightens his or her experience of hypnosis, and every undesirable response to your suggestions, indicates that  he  or  she  may  not  be  following  you  (which  also  means  you  may  not  have  been following him or her as well as you might have). A more direct means for finding out how your client is doing is to simply ask the client neutrally, directly or indirectly, for specific verbal and nonverbal feedback about his or her experience during and again after the hypnosis session.\nKeeping suggestions easy to follow isn't the same as  being predictable and obvious about where you are going with the hypnotic process. If the person is able to guess where you're  going  and  can  too  easily  remain  a  step  ahead  of  you,  there  is  obviously considerable conscious analysis taking place, increasing (but by no means assuring) the likelihood of reduced responsiveness. If you become aware that you may have lost the client  somewhere along the way, you can go back to a point in the process where you sensed he or she was with you (and, if you are as observant as you can possibly be, you won't have to go back very far) and go on from there, but obviously not in the same way.\nDon't force the client to rely on conscious processes to follow you. Keep in mind that only your client can be the one to determine what he or she can and cannot follow. In other words, you may think your directives were explicit and easily understandable, but you're not the one following them-your client is.",

        "text": "One of the lessons from the field of hypnosis which has been especially helpful clinically is the idea of using the language of the client whenever possible. You have learned that words represent experience, and even though we use a common language, our individual experiences  are  necessarily  dif-ferent.  Taking  the  client's  words,  then  attaching  your meaning to them, then translating them into the conceptual language you happen to use, and then, finally, communicating from your linguistic style are all steps that are arbitrary on your part, and thus increase the likelihood of miscommunication.\nIn  using  the  language  of  the  client,  you  don't  assume,  even  for  a  moment,  that  you mean the same thing as he or she does in using it. You can use the same language as your client simply because it is his or her world you are dealing with, not yours.\nIn studying numerous clinical theories and interacting with a wide variety of clinicians representing various treatment approaches, I have been unfavorably impressed with how a client's communications about his or her experience get translated into the clinician's favorite  theoretical  jargon,  and  then  get  fed  back  to  the  client  that  way.  Words  are symbols of experience, not the experience themselves. They represent a distortion (i.e., a distillation) of real-world experience anyway, so why distort them even further with new labels  of  interest  to  the  clinician?  I  have  had  clients  that  have  'resolved  transference issues,' 'built ego strength,' 'strengthened their armor,' and 'released energy blocks.' They did these and lots of other things that pleased their therapists, yet they left treatment not  feeling  much  better  about  themselves.  The  main  advantage  of  using  the  client's language is in your ability to intervene in the client's problem as he or she experiences it, and not as you interpret it. Furthermore, the client can get the sense of being understood to a greater degree, engendering greater trust in the clinician. (Continued on page 269)",

Erickson, M.D. (1980, Brunner/Mazel), Experiencing Erickson (1985a, Brunner/ Mazel), and Milton H.Erickson (written with W.Michael Munion, 1999, Sage Publications).\nO n  His  Personal  Experience  of  Milton  Erickson: 'I  vividly  remember how emotionally touched I was by the experience of being with Erickson. On\nthe second day of my visit, I watched him struggle to move himself from his wheelchair  to  his  office  chair.  Then  he  started  speaking  to  me  through  his obvious pain, intent  on  instructing  me  about  how  to  be  more  effective  as  a person  and  therapist.  I  remember  feeling  powerfully  moved  that  he  would selflessly spend his limited energy to help me. No powerful figure I had met before had such a moving impact. There was something extraordinary about Erickson: Perhaps his profound effect was due to his acute sensitivity, respect for the individual, intensity, verve, uniqueness, and joie de vivre in the face of adversity. I saw him struggle to bring out the best in himself and it inspired me to want to do the same' (Zeig, 1985a, p. 167).\nO n the Mission of The Milton H.Erickson Foundation: 'The intention was to differentiate Ericksonian methods from other schools and then quickly integrate them into the mainstream of psychotherapy, which we accomplished. We did not want to establish Ericksonian therapy as a distinct school. Erickson's contributions have relevance to psychotherapy in general and  now  have  been  incorporated  into  other  approaches,  including  cognitive behavioral therapy. Erickson's work advanced the field of psychotherapy; he was more than a pioneer in hypnosis.'\nO n  How Erickson Is Widely Perceived: 'Erickson  was  sought  after  by some of the great minds of the 20th century, including Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson. He was respected because of his genius, endeared because of his humanism.  Now  Erickson is widely acknowledged as one of psychotherapy's  most  innovative  pioneers.  Erickson  was  one  of  the  most public therapists of his time, consistently showing what he did at a time when demonstrations of therapy for the professional public were not popular. His work is readily available for serious research and critique.'\nOn  Erickson  in  Retrospect: 'I think  Erickson  was  'on  the  spot'  in pioneering the doctrine of utilization; tailoring  therapy to the uniqueness of the individual; using confusion and multilevel communication;  and  in harnessing  what  have  become  well  understood  and  well  researched  social psychological principle of influence. But, no amount of research will clarify the essential nature of hypnosis, just as no amount of research will clarify the essential  nature  of  love.  Erickson's  artistry  will  not  be  lost  because  of research. Evolving research will shed light on the effectiveness of his clinical work.  Erickson  was  the  consummate  social  psychologist  studying  how situational  effects  alter  behavior.  Recent  mainstream  psychological  research studies on effects such as priming have demonstrated that Erickson was right in  applying  the  analogous  clinical  method  of  'seeding,'  one  of  Erickson's favorites.'\nO n Encouraging  the  Personal  Development  of  the  Therapist: 'I integrate methods from systemic therapy, Gestalt, and Transactional Analysis. I  use much of what I learned from Erickson as a foundation, but I have my\nown style and perspective. The therapist is more the tool of change than the techniques the therapist uses. An evolving clinician can best facilitate patient evolution. Erickson was a 'people-builder,' not a technician. Similarly, I am more dedicated to help clinicians BE the best therapists than helping them to learn techniques to DO therapy. Therapist development, moreover, motivates and inspires clinicians and obviates burnout.'\nO n What He Calls the 'Gift-Wrapping' of Suggestions: 'Pa tients 'giftwrap'  their  problems  within  symptoms  and  the  therapist  must  unwrap  the symptom  to discover the problem. Similarly, therapists can gift-wrap solutions and suggestions within techniques such as anecdotes and metaphors, encouraging  the  patient  to  activate  to  realize  the  intended  message.  Hence, therapy is an exchange of presents (and presence).'\nO n  the  Artistry  and  Science  of  Hypnosis  and  Erickson: 'The  most widely known research on hypnosis focuses on the nature of the phenomena, not on clinical outcomes. The major hypnosis researchers of the 20th century were scientists, not clinicians. Erickson's first career was as a researcher and he  was  more  like  an  anthropologist  conducting  field  studies  than  a  modern psychological researcher armed with an ANOVA. Because there is a lot to be learned,  I  hope  that  some  of  Erickson's  research  methodologies  will  be resurrected and modernized.'\nSource: Personal communication, January 15, 2003\nSometimes, using the language of the client is neither appropriate nor desirable. If  the person's style of speech is too idiosyncratic, or is related to the client's particular ethnic group or other subculture of which you are not a member, your using the same language to  try  to  make  a  positive  connection  may  instead  be  viewed  as  mockery  and  insulting. Recovery from such a mistake is difficult.\nSome  clinicians  have  a  personal  bias  against  using  the  client's  language.  I  had  an interaction a while ago with a prominent sex therapist who believed that if a patient of his used common language to describe a problem, it was his duty to make a point of speaking back to the person with the proper scientific jargon. He gave the example that if a male patient were to present the complaint that he 'couldn't get it up,' his response would be to  speak  to  the  patient  about  his  'erectile  dysfunction  and  inability  to  perform  coitus.' Those seemed, to me to least, to be cold, sterile terms that really don't reflect his client's experience.  When  I  offered  my  reaction  for  some  discussion,  the  doctor  said  that,  'I didn't go to medical school to speak like an ignorant layman.' Well, I didn't go through all the schooling I did for that purpose, either. Might he reach a wider range of the people he  works  with  by  working  with  them  in  terms  they  naturally  use  and  can  understand instead  of  expecting  them  to  come  to  his  level?  Probably.  And,  likewise,  are  there patients  of  his  relieved  by  his  treating  so  personal  a  problem  more  professionally  and scientifically? Probably. The point I'm making is about the value of considering the use of the client's language to possibly enhance the interaction. It takes a lot of flexibility to want to do that, though.\nThere is another important aspect of noticing and using a client's language that has to\ndo with the role of the unconscious mind in the person's language choice. A client's word choice can reflect dimensions of the problem's dynamics at an unconscious level. This is especially true where a word or phrase is used idiosyncratically. Noticing a client's word usage may  be a significant factor in formulating an intervention based on an understanding of what the words mean to the client.",

        "text": "Since words are simply symbols of the experiences they represent, using the same words as  your  client  doesn't  mean  you  are  describing  the  same  experience.  Therefore,  it  is imperative  to  have  the  client  explain  to  you  the  experience  he  or  she  is  presenting  as significant  as  best  he  or  she  can,  rather  than  him  or  her  just  using  a  word  or  two  to represent the experience. Whatever words are used they will never give you a complete idea  of  what  the  person  is  subjectively  experiencing,  but  the  more  definition  and description  of  his  or  her  experience  you  have,  the  more  opportunity  you  have  for meaningful intervention.\nSome clinicians are afraid to ask the client for  clarification,  erroneously  believing  it will  reflect  a  lack  of  understanding.  Thus,  when  a  client  says,  'I  have  this  terrible depression, ya know what I mean?' the eager-to-prove-empathy therapist is likely to say, 'Yes, I know what you mean.' But, the client's experience of depression in this example is being hallucinated by the clinician. The clinician apparently knows what depression is from  previous  experience,  personal  and  professional,  and  now  puts  this  client  into  the same  category  as  others  termed  'depressed.'  However,  what  this  particular  client  is actually  experiencing  is  unknown.  A  more  effective  response  might  be,  'Can  you describe  what  your  experience  of  being  depressed  is  like  for  you?'  Having  the  client describe the experience in his or her own way can lead you to a better understanding of how and where to intervene.\nThis  point  is  illustrated  well  in  the  following  case  example:  A  woman  in  her  early twenties came for therapy for what she called 'a terrific phobia of men.' I thought the words 'terrific' and 'phobia' were odd ones to be connected, and I wanted to know what her experience was of what she called a 'phobia.' So, I asked her, 'What do you mean by a  phobia?'  Her  response  was,  'I  have  a  phobia  of  men-you  know,  I  just  can't  get enough of them, and that complicates my life.'\nIf  I  had  responded  to  her  on  the  basis  of  my  experience  and  understanding  of  what 'phobia' means, I might have started asking her questions about her fears associated with men.  And,  in  so  doing,  I  would  likely  have  caused  her  to  believe  that  I  really  didn't understand her  and  probably  couldn't  help  her.  By  having  her  describe  her  experience instead of getting sidetracked by the (inappropriate) label she chose to represent it, I was able to begin her treatment in a different direction, one much closer to meeting her needs. Even if a client uses a label appropriately, though, we are invariably striving to alter their actual experience, not the label they use to represent it.\nIn having clients define the meanings of the terms they use, the clinician can often help the person redefine the term and subsequently alter the experience it represents. This is the essence of a technique called 'Reframing,' in which an experience is changed by the\nuse of a different term to redefine the experience. Thus 'cheap' can be altered to 'fiscally conservative,'  a  'retreat'  can  be  reframed  as  a  'strategic  military  withdrawal,'  and 'weird' can become 'uninhibited and eccentric.'\nIn  one  workshop  I  conducted,  a  participant  said  she  would  like  to  'not  be  so controlling.' I asked her what she meant, and she responded she would like to 'let others make a decision for me once in a while.' Given her definition of control, that is, whoever makes the decisions for her, being in control all the time can certainly be burdensome. In hypnosis, I told her I thought her definition was an interesting one, but I define control in another way. I define control as having choices; someone who is in control has a lot of choices about what he or she will say or do, but someone who is not in control has no choices. 'Sometimes, a person has only the illusion of being in control, and may not have enough actual control to choose to make no choices.' When she deciphered what I said, her  response  was  a  look  of  relief  and  the  statement,  'That's  true.  I  never  realized  it before, but I don't need less control-I need more, so I can choose sometimes not to have to  choose.  Having  more  choices  will  change  everything!'  A  simple  redefinition  of 'control' that allowed for more personal freedom changed her experience of herself in a positive  way.  Instead  of  'control'  being  something  negative,  it  can  now  be  associated with a positive experience of recognizing her choices at a given time, one of which may be to let someone else be responsible for a change.\nWords  are  the  medium  of  exchange  between  the  clinician  and  client,  and  the  more ambiguous the words, the greater the room for miscommunication. This point emphasizes the need to be aware of both the connotative and denotative meanings of your words. If a client takes literally something you intended to be taken figuratively, or vice versa, the result may be an undesirable one.",

        "text": "Generally, suggestions should be phrased in the present tense and in terms of what the person is currently experiencing. Of course, most therapeutic suggestions are intended to influence future behavior in some way, but the hypnotic session is the bridge between what is happening now and what will, hopefully, be happening later. The basic structure of  hypnotic  suggestions  is  linking  what  is  occurring  now  to  what  is  desired:  'As  you experience this, you can start to experience that ' Continuous feedback about the person's present state is necessary to make the bridge effective.\nThis point is especially true in the case of working directly with variables of time, such as in age regression. When you are working with memory, talking to the person in past tense  terms  of  what  occurred  'then'  will  produce  a  different  and  much  less  profound response than will talking to the person as if he or she is experiencing that past situation now. Having as much of the client in the 'here-and-now' (whether the here-and-now is actually a past or future context) gives the clinician working access to more of the person. Current needs, motivations, feelings, values, and behaviors are available for incorporation into  the  process.  In  part,  this  is  where  hypnosis  as  a  tool  derives  its  power.  Instead  of intellectually talking about a situation one is removed from, the clinician recreates that experience now and deals with the resulting issues as they arise now.",

In  general,  suggestions  should  be  phrased  in positive ways as to what the person can do instead of what he or she can't do. Remember the effect of me directing you not to think of the taste of pizza? Suggesting to someone what  not  to  do  has  the  same  effect  as  being  told  what  to  do  in  part  because  of transderivational search and in part because it does not provide an alternative focal point. An analogy about learning through reward or punishment might be useful to elaborate this  point.  In  simply  punishing  someone  for  doing  something  wrong,  there  is  nothing provided to tell the person what the right thing to do is. The person merely learns what not  to  do,  and  receiving  repeated  punishment  with  no  alternatives  provided  leads  to frustration, anger, and finally a point where punishment is no longer effective.\nPositive suggestions that assist the client in discovering what he or she can do are a principal goal of treatment. Negative suggestions can be effective when carefully used, but the overwhelming majority of suggestions you use will likely be of a positive nature.",

        "text": "Support for the client in the form of encouragement and compliments can go a long way in assisting the client to find resources within him- or herself. The process of encouraging a client is typically one of guiding the client into a position where he or she can identify and  acknowledge  personal  strengths  and  resources  previously  overlooked  in  him-  or herself. Typically, the person seeking help feels out of control and frustrated. Seemingly empty compliments that  contradict  the  person's  low  self-esteem  are  easily  disregarded (recall the earlier discussion of cognitive dissonance). Guiding the person into a position of self-acknowledgment (contradicting his or her own negative self-generalizations), and confirming and then complimenting that recognition has been a powerful intervention, in my experience. Having the client reach his or her own conclusion that he or she is better off  than  previously  assumed  can  be  a  more  profound  experience  for  him  or  her  than simply hearing me say so.\nSome clinicians are of the belief that a client has to be 'torn down' before he or she can be 'built up.' For them, therapy often consists of attack, negativity, and disrespect. I don't subscribe to such views, and believe that a client must be approached with respect. A client's behavior is not the client, rather it is a reflection of what choices the person perceives  as  available  at  a  given  moment.  The  clinician's  role  is  to  provide  new alternatives  that  are  more  adaptive  for  the  person.  When  the  new  choices  fit  the  client well, and are provided with a recognition of the person's integrity, the pro-cess of change can be considerably smoother.\nAnother dimension of the suggestion to encourage and compliment the client relates to the notion of accepting the client's communications as a means for facilitating hypnotic induction  and  utilization  of  the  hypnosis  for  therapy.  This  is  known  as  the  'utilization approach,'  and  its  underlying  principle  is  'accept  and  utilize'  client  responses.  The sophistication of the utilization approach lies in its accepting (rather than contradicting) the  client's  communications  (i.e.,  beliefs,  values,  experiences),  and  then  striving  to discover a way of utilizing them to facilitate change. If a client presents the complaint\nthat, 'I'm a no-good crazy person' and the clinician responds, 'No, you're not, you're a good person who is  just  confused,'  the  clinician  has  not  accepted  the  client's  view  of him- or herself. (Part of forming a meaningful response is determining whether such a self-effacing  statement  is  a  genuinely  felt  one  or  just  a  manipulation  to  get  a  free compliment).  Accepting  the  client  as  he  or  she  sees  him-  or  herself  ('You  may  think you're a no-good crazy person right now, but I couldn't help but notice how much sense your no-good craziness has made given your circumstances which means you have sense even you don't know about just yet…') is the first step toward attaining a position with him  or  her  from  which  to  effect  meaningful  changes.  Furthermore,  it  allows  for  the message 'What you are doing right now is fine, because that is exactly what will allow you to accomplish the change you desire.' Accepting the current state of affairs without a critical  reproach  is  desirable  in  order  to  encourage  the  client  to  use  the  bridge  of  the intervention to reach the desired goals.",

If the client feels he or she is a 'victim,' or if he or she is a 'blamer' with no awareness of personal responsibility at all for his or her experience, then helping the client to change in some meaningful way is more difficult. If you believe you  have  no  control  over  your  experience,  then  attempts  to  demonstrate  to  you  that control is possible will most likely be ignored or dismissed with the ever-familiar, 'Yes, but…' excuses of why change is impossible. Helping people to discover that they have power to control the events in their lives, at the most, or, at the least, their reactions to the events in their lives, is a necessary component of therapeutic work.\nThe underlying goal is to empower people, a foundation for all health professionals in the work they do. People don't get better when they see themselves as victims. Rather, they get better  when they sense they can influence the course of their problems or the intensity  of  their  symptoms.  Thus,  it  is  an  essential  part  of  treatment  that  the  person define him- or herself as a participant, an owner of problem-solving resources and not just the owner of a sense of victimhood.",

        "text": "A  useful concept  originating in the Neuro-Linguistic  Programming  (NLP)  model (Bandler & Grinder, 1979) concerns people's preferred style for gathering information, storing it, retrieving it, and communicating about it. Most people have a preferred sense that  is  more  well  developed  and  more  heavily  relied  on  in  processing  day-to-day experience. Some people are quite visual in terms of their preferred modality, meaning they tend to think in pictures, remember or imagine images more clearly, and process the visual portion of experience more completely. Other people favor the auditory modality,\nthinking  in  terms  of  internal  dialogue,  talking  to  themselves  about  their  experience, remembering or imagining sounds and conversations with great clarity, and processing the  auditory  portion  of  ongoing  experience  more  completely.  Still  others  favor  the kinesthetic  modality,  thinking  in  terms  of  feelings,  remembering  or  imagining  the feelings associated with various experiences with clarity, and processing the kinesthetic portion of ongoing experience more completely.\nIt is important to realize that each person processes experience in all of the senses all of the  time.  The  issue  of  clinical  concern  here  is  which  modality  is  dominant  in  a  given context, particularly the symptom context. If a clinician can identify a person's favored system  of  sensory  experience,  he  or  she  can  choose  to  adapt  communications  to  that favored system and possibly increase the likelihood of meaningful influence through the attainment of greater rapport.\nThe language a person uses spontaneously, particularly the predicates (including verbs, adverbs, and  adjectives), reflects a person's favored information-processing style. Language, because it is structured for the most part at an unconscious level, reflects the unconscious  patterns  of  thinking  through  the  specific  words  chosen  to  reflect  inner experience. Thus, if in the course of a discussion I make a point that the listener responds to  by  saying,  'I see what  you  mean;  that looks right  to  me,'  I  can  deduce  a  visual preference  in  the  listener  relative  to  my  point.  If  the  listener  responds  to  my  point  by saying, 'I hear what you're saying; that sounds right  to  me,'  I  can  deduce an auditory preference. If the listener responds, 'I get a feel for what you mean; that idea grabs me,' I can deduce a preference for the kinesthetic modality. In each case, I can use language that will  appeal  to  the  preferred  style.  For  example,  with  a  visually  oriented  person,  using visual imagery techniques is likely to be effective, but is likely to be less effective with the person who has a strong kinesthetic orientation.\nThe inability to notice a client's language usage, particularly in the area of preferred sensory modalities, can be a source of resistance. Responding to a client who says, 'I feel bad' with a sensorily mismatched statement like, 'Can you see why you feel bad?' is not likely to get a meaningful response, at least not as useful as a matched statement might.\nA study I published (1981) demonstrated the greater depth at which research subjects could  experience  hypnotic  relaxation  when  the  induction's  predicates  were  matched  to their  preferred  modality.  The  matching  of  predicates  to  facilitate  hypnosis  is  simply another way of using the language of the client while acknowledging the uniqueness of each  person.  Furthermore,  since  all  experience  can  ultimately  be  broken  down  into  its sensory  components,  the  use  of  language  patterns  that  emphasize  the  sensations  of  an experience  will  have  a  more  powerful  effect  than  the  use  of  more  distant,  intellectual terminology. Consider the effect of the following statement:\nThink of how pleasant a walk in the woods can be…so enjoyable, enlightening and peaceful…",

The greater power is in the use of emotional, sensorily descriptive  language,  instead  of  intellectual  language  that  appeals  primarily  to  the conscious mind, the lesser force in guiding human behavior.\nThe best sensory-based descriptions are those that influence the client's experience the most.

        "text": "While  it  is  a  high  priority  to  provide  relevant  information  to  clients,  and  the  ethical practice of securing an informed consent is highly desirable, it is also clinically necessary not  to  provide  too  much  information  about  one's  interventions.  Giving  the  client  the opportunity to develop defenses by analyzing and criticizing what the clinician is doing is counterproductive to the aims of therapy. Rather than explain why I am doing whatever I'm  doing,  most  frequently  I  just  do  it.  The  spontaneity  from  the  experience  of  my communications is what has an impact on the person, not the explanation of what I am trying to do. If I say to a client, 'I'm going to give you a negative suggestion now in a 'reverse psychology' strategy so you'll think you're spontaneously doing what I tell you not to do,' what is the likelihood of me getting the response I want? Answer: Zero.\nPresenting and withholding information selectively can be an obvious ethical dilemma (Scheflin,  2001;  Zeig,  1985b).  How  can  a  client  provide  informed  consent  if  he  or  she doesn't know what the clinician is doing and why? Yet, if he or she knows exactly what the clinician is doing, then how can the intervention succeed? This is a matter that must be handled delicately on a case by case basis, as the clinician gets a 'feel' for how much information the client wants and needs to succeed.\nOne  of  the  most  interesting  dimensions  of  the  work  of  the  late  Milton  H.Erickson, M.D., was his ability to obtain compliance from his patients to demands he made on them\nthat  were  sometimes  nothing  short  of  outrageous.  Erickson  lived  in  an  era  where  a doctor's authority went virtually unchallenged, and so if he asked his patient to climb a mountain to symbolically gain a greater overall view of things, the patient usually would. A more likely response in today's therapy climate is, 'Why? I think I'll get two other doctors'  opinions.'  If  Erickson  explained  why  he  wanted  the  patient  to  climb  the mountain,  would  it  have  the  same  therapeutic  impact?  Yet,  doesn't  the  patient  have  a right to know?\nPeople often asked Erickson how he motivated people to do the things he wanted them do (Haley, 1973; Zeig, 1980). His answer was simple: 'Because they know I mean it!' Trust,  rapport,  and  respect  for  the  client's  integrity  are  key  ingredients  in  the  hypnotic interaction.",

In  hypnosis,  this characteristic  is  amplified  to  the  point  of  being  a  critical  component  of  the  interaction, one to be noticed and respected by the clinician. To pressure someone to respond to your pace of doing things just won't work in doing hypnosis. Instead, you have to allow the client to form the suggested response at the rate he or she chooses. Imposing a time limit on the client's  responses is  more typically  a beginner's  mistake, caused  by uncertainty and  a  lack  of  experience.  Often,  students  in  my  introductory  courses  who  are  first learning to do hypnosis might suggest an arm levitation, for example, and if the subject's arm  doesn't  immediately  begin  to  lift,  the  student  may  get  agitated  and  assume  the subject  is  resisting  or  he  or  she  is  doing  something  wrong.  If  they  start  to  repeat  their suggestions, I will stop them and instruct them to simply wait. Almost invariably, after a short while, the subject's arm begins to lift and the student has now learned to be a bit more patient in letting the subject respond in his or her own time.\nIn  the  phase  of  guiding  the  person  out  of  hypnosis,  called  'disengagement'  or 'alerting,'  this  is  especially  true.  I  have  always  disliked  using  a  count-up  to  guide  the person out of hypnosis (e.g., 'When I count to three you will awaken, open your eyes, and be alert and refreshed') because it forces the client to adapt to your arbitrary choice of when he or she should come out of hypnosis, instead of letting him or her choose for him- or herself. I prefer a general closure on the order of: 'When you have taken the time to  complete  this  experience,  you  can  bring  yourself  out  of  hypnosis  at  a  rate  that  is comfortable for you…'\nLet the person take the time he or she needs to fully develop the responses you suggest. No need to hurry…",

I have seen so many sessions that were going well ruined in an instant because the clinician assumed enough rapport was present (if he or she even thought about it, which some  'touchy-feely'  clinicians  never  do)  to  touch  the  person.  The  touch  was  entirely innocent, a well-intended expression of support or empathy, yet was highly disruptive to the  client.  It  is  very  important  to  get  permission  to  touch  the  person  for  a  number  of reasons.\nFirst, touch is associated to intimacy-a cross into personal space. Some clients may welcome it,  but  others  hate  to  be  touched  and  experience  it  as  a  violation  of  personal territory. With such persons, it can hinder or even destroy rapport.\nSecond, in  hypnosis,  the  person  is  typically  (not  always)  focused  inwardly  on  some internal experience. To have to notice or respond to a clinician's touch means reorienting one's focus to the external world, which is generally counterproductive to the development and maintenance of a deeper hypnosis. If you use touch indiscriminately, you can thus unintentionally work against yourself.\nThird, an unexpected touch may simply startle the person, even if he or she doesn't find  it  offensive.  The  person  may  be  so  lost  in  thought  that  he  or  she  may  even  have forgotten that you are even there! To suddenly feel a hand on you can scare anybody, in or out of hypnosis.\nFourth, the media have played on the terrible misconception that hypnosis is a means for seducing vulnerable clients. The sexual implication of touching someone unexpectedly can easily trigger unnecessary problems in this domain.\nIt  is  always a good idea to politely ask the client for permission to touch him or her during hypnosis, for it certainly demonstrates a respect for his or her integrity. Whether you ask before  your  hypnosis  session  begins  (e.g.,  'During  this  session  I  will  want  to touch  the  back  of  your  hand  to  gauge  your  degree  of  analgesia…is  that  all  right  with you?') or at some time during the hypnotic process is a matter of personal preference (I prefer to do both ), just so long as you secure permission before touching your client.",

The best tool to prevent this problem from arising is called the 'anticipation signal.' Anticipation signals are  announcements of your intentions, effectively  letting your  client  know  what action you  are  about  to  take  so  as  not  to  startle  him  or  her.  They  also  serve  the  deepening function of keeping the client comfortable enough to not feel as though he or she has to pay  conscious  attention  to  everything  you  say  and  do.  Such  conscious  analysis  is generally counterproductive to hypnosis.\nAnticipation  signals  are  simple  statements  you  make  during  hypnosis  about  what  is coming next in the process. The generic structure for an anticipation signal is, 'In just a moment, I'm going to (fill-in-the-blank).' For example, I may say, 'In just a moment, I am going to take your left hand by the wrist and raise it above your head.' Assuming I have received permission to touch the person ('…and if that's all right with you, please nod your head'), I am now preparing the person for my touch rather than just taking his\nor  her  wrist  and  lifting  it  without  warning.  It  is  a  much  gentler  and  more  respectful approach,  and  clients  greatly  appreciate  that  consideration.  When  you  state,  'In  just  a moment I'm going to…', and then follow through in a way that is entirely consistent with what you stated your actions would be, a new level of trust in you can be reached, aiding in your future work together.\nFrom  the  client's perspective,  it is very  difficult to be  relaxed  and  on  guard simultaneously. Anticipation signals are a very quick, simple, and effective way to foster trust in the hypnotic relationship while giving the client a valuable sense of participation in the process.",

        "text": "Your tools as a skilled communicator are your voice and body. Beyond your words, your nonverbal  communications  can  serve  to  reinforce  or  even  negate  your  suggestions. Paying attention to such factors as eye contact, body posture, gestures, touch, timing, use of  space,  tone  and  volume  of  voice,  and  facial  expressions  is  necessary  in  order  to maximize  the  value  of  the  things  you  say.  If  you  don't  incorporate  these  nonverbal components of communication well, positive results will be slow in coming, if they come at all.\nIt helps immeasurably to have control of your voice and body in communicating, using yourself  as  the  mechanism  to  drive  a  suggestion  home.  To  have  tension  in  your  voice when you suggest to your client that he or she relax is an avoidable incongruity. To use a normal  conversional  tone  of  voice  with  someone  you  want  to  guide  into  a  different internal state of experience is another avoidable incongruity.\nIt is a good idea to have a well-practiced calm tone of voice and relaxed body posture to model for your client what you want him or her to experience. To gradually shift from your usual tone of voice to one more soothing and hypnotic builds an association (what some call an 'auditory anchor') in your client's mind between that tone of your voice and the  implied  invitation  to  the  client  to  go  into  hypnosis.  Establishing  that  association makes it a smoother transition into doing hypnosis in subsequent sessions. Once the client associates going into hypnosis with that tone of your voice, you don't necessarily have to formally announce, 'Now let's do hypnosis.' Instead, you can gradually lead into using the  voice  your  client  associates  to  entering  hypnosis,  effectively  inducing  hypnosis without a formal induction. Using a soothing, comforting voice throughout your process also  serves  the  additional  purpose  of  discouraging  conscious  analysis,  calming  the person, and reducing the need for defensive hypervigilance.\nThe nonverbal components  of your communications are critical to generating successful  hypnotic  experiences  in  your  clients.  It  can  be  helpful  to  make  audio-  or videotapes of yourself doing hypnosis in order to learn how you look and sound as you do so. Often, people have no idea of how they look or sound as they interact with others, so getting feedback from a variety of sources can be highly instructive.",

        "text": "Like most of the other communication patterns offered as guidelines in this chapter, this particular one is a constant in doing hypnosis. 'Chaining suggestions' means linking the desired  response  to  the  client's  present  experience.  The  idea  is  to  build  a  link  (hence 'chain') between what the client is currently doing and what you would like him or her to do.  The  generic  suggestion  structure  for  chaining  suggestions  is,  'As  you  experience (this), you can start to experience (that).' For example, as you continue to sit there and read these words, you can begin to notice your left foot.\nAs  Bandler  and  Grinder  (1975)  pointed  out,  there  are  three  types  of  links  between current  and  future  experiences,  varying  in  the  strength  of  the  linkages.  As  will  be  true with all three links, the first half of the statement matches (paces, accepts) the person's current  experience  while  the  second  half  suggests  (leads,  utilizes)  a  possible,  but  not current, experience.\nThe first link is the 'simple conjunction.' It is the weakest link, and simply suggests an association between what is and what can be. It employs such connecting words as 'and' and 'but.' For example:\nYou are looking at me and starting to feel comfortable.\nYou can see the clock clearly but still allow time to slow down.\nThe second link, and a slightly stronger one, is called the 'implied causative,' employing such connecting words as 'as,' 'while,' and 'during.' For example:\nAs you notice yourself relaxing, you can let your eyes close.\nYou can listen to me while your conscious mind drifts off.\nYou can feel yourself growing more comfortable during your experience of vividly remembering your high school graduation.\nThe third,  and  strongest,  link  is  the  'causative  predicate.'  It's  the  strongest  because  it claims  that  not  only  are  the  current  and  desired  behaviors  connected,  but  one  actually causes the other. For example:\nBreathing deeply will make you relax even more.\nShifting your body's posture will cause you to want to close your eyes.\nEach of these links forms a bridge to get the client to respond in a particular way on the basis of what he or she is doing currently. A typical hypnotic process, using the 'As you X you can Y' chaining formula, may sound something like this:\nAs you continue to look at me, you can take in a deep breath…and as you take in a deep breath, you can allow your eyes to close…and as your eyes close, you can let your mind drift back to a specific memory…and as your mind drifts back to a specific memory you can begin to describe the memory out loud…and as\nyou begin to describe the memory out loud you can…\nStructurally, each suggestion is chained to the response before it, starting with a statement feeding  back  to  the  client  his  current,  undeniable  reality,  that  is,  that  he  or  she  was looking at me and in so doing could take in a deep breath. Looking at someone and taking in a deep breath are not usually connected, and in this example are only connected by an arbitrary link of my own creation. Each response is then fed back (paced, accepted) as the basis for the desired response (the lead, or utilization).\nSuggestions linked in this way are the basis for the hypnotic process being a flowing one  rather  than  a  choppy,  disconnected  one  in  terms  of  delivery.  Grammatically,  of course,  hypnotic  phrasing  is  a  strict  grammarian's  nightmare,  but  to  the  person  in hypnosis, the clinician is smooth and easy to listen to.",

For example, 'Let your right hand feel warmer' as a suggestion for the specific response of hand warmth is easier to resist than  is  a  more  general  process  suggestion:  'You  may  notice  a  particular  change  of temperature in one of your hands.' In the latter suggestion, which hand was to change was not specified, nor was it specific whether the hand was to grow warmer or cooler. Whatever response the person has can now be defined as a cooperative one.\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid the use of detail in suggestions. And, it is not always desirable to do so because often it is the details you provide during the hypnotic process that make suggestions easier to follow. Learning to 'be general specifically,' that is,  sounding  specific  but  being  general,  can  help  you  avoid  some  of  the  unnecessary rejections of your suggestions. Notice as early on as possible whether you are being too specific  (or  too  general)  on  the  basis  of  the  client's  responsiveness  to  you,  and,  if necessary, shift your style as you go on.",

        "text": "As the hypnosis session begins and starts to develop focus and momentum, enhancing the client's  responsiveness  to  your  suggestions  is  a  primary  goal.  The  term  'response  set' refers  to  a  pattern  of  responding.  Not  unlike  always  choosing  'answer  a'  in  a  multiple choice test, the task of the clinician is to encourage the client to develop a patterned style of fuller and consistent responding to suggestions.\nThe  most  commonly  used  response  set  is  one  commonly  known  as  the  'Yes  set' described by Erickson (Erickson, Rossi, & Rossi, 1976; Erickson & Rossi, 1979). A 'Yes set' on the part of the client is a patterned response of accepting-in essence saying yes to-the suggestions you provide. Building an agreeable frame of mind is valuable at any time during the hypnosis session, but is especially important at the outset when you are\nfirst establishing the therapeutic alliance with the client.\nThe  most  common  means  of  establishing  a  'yes  set'  is  with  the  use  of  a  series  of truisms, the suggestions you learned in the last chapter that involve making statements that  seem  so  obviously  true  there  is  no  legitimate  basis  for  rejecting  them  (e.g., 'Sometimes  people  surprise  themselves  by  knowing  things  they  didn't  know  they knew…'). As you offer  three  or  four  truisms  in  a  row,  the  client  silently  agrees  with each.  If  you  agree  with  statement  number  one,  then  again  with  statement  number  two, then statement number three, and then statement number four, what is your most likely response going to be to statement number five? Agreement.\nIn general, when doing hypnosis, you go from general to specific. Before you ask for specific hypnotic responses, such as an analgesia, you first have to build a momentum in the  client's  responsiveness  that  will  facilitate  such  a  complex  response.  So,  you  might first offer a series of general statements (such as truisms) about ways he or she can begin to think of her physical perceptions being malleable. For example: 'The human body is so  complex  in  its  many  organs  and  organ  systems…and  isn't  it  interesting  how  our perceptions  of  our  bodies  change  from  time  to  time…sometimes  you  feel  warm,  and sometimes you feel cool…and sometimes you feel tuned in to your body, and sometimes you feel distant from it…' Once a general sense of variability in physical perception has been  established,  the  clinician  can  then  go  from  general  to  specific  in  suggesting  a particular change in physical perception, such as an analgesia.\nThe 'yes set' is the most commonly used one for what are now obvious reasons, but there are others as well. There may be times when you want to deliberately encourage rejection of your suggestions (e.g., to foster greater independence) with a 'no set.' Or, there  may  be  times  when  you  want  to  encourage  skepticism  or  uncertainty  (e.g.,  with someone very confident but very wrong) with an 'I don't know' set.\nMost  people,  as  you  will  discover,  don't  simply  form  an  immediate  response  to  a suggestion.  The  skilled  clinician  recognizes  the  importance  of  taking  the  time  to  build responsiveness in the client as the session progresses. In fact, if you were to ask me what single stage of the interaction most influences the overall success of the hypnosis session, I'd say it's the stage of deliberately building a response set.",

It  isn't  terribly  important  to  sell  your  clients  hypnosis;  it's  only important  to  help  them  have  positive  and  therapeutic  experiences  with  it.  If  the  client reacts negatively to your query about any experience he or she might have previously had with  hypnosis,  you  might  exercise  the  option  of  using  another  term  to  label  your intervention. Some specific possible alternative labels are:\nProgressive muscle relaxation, 1 = Visual imagery. Controlled relaxation, 1 = Guided imagery. Guided relaxation, 1 = Guided fantasy.

While  it  is  arguable  whether  these  spontaneous  hypnotic  experiences  are  the  same  as hypnosis produced in either the laboratory or clinical setting, at the very least they clearly share  many  common  characteristics.  Theoretically,  then,  inducing  hypnosis  in  others shouldn't be a particularly difficult thing to do. In fact, usually it isn't all that difficult to do,  yet  it  can  be  very  difficult  if  the  client  has  poor  concentration,  low  motivation, negative expectations, fear of hypnosis, or if the interpersonal dynamics of communication and influence aren't skillfully applied in an appropriate context.\nHaving  the  ability  to  develop  hypnosis  and  experience  hypnotic  phenomena  on  a spontaneous  basis  in  the  course  of  daily  living  is  important  for  survival.  Focusing  on changing  traffic  conditions  as  you  drive,  concentrating  on  material  you're  reading  and trying to understand and retain, or narrowing your focus to important information a loved one is sharing are all snippets of countless hypnotically based experiences that are core components  of  effective  daily  living.  As  essentially  episodes  of  self-hypnosis  of  brief duration for attending to whatever stimulus captures our attention, there are none of the potential  interpersonal  resistances  present.  In  contrast,  however,  experiencing  hypnosis with another person who is in the role of a guide (i.e., the clinician) raises relationship dynamics such as  issues  of  control,  power,  responsibility,  and  so  on.  Consideration  of such  dynamics  is  implicit  in  your  choosing  a  style  of  suggestion  formulation.  For example,  you  assume  more  power  over  the  client  if  you  choose  to  offer  authoritarian commands to him or her which require compliance rather than permissive suggestions which invite collaboration.\nThe phrase 'inducing hypnosis' implies the clinician is doing something to the client. The language of hypnosis is sometimes limiting and even misleading, for the client is not simply a passive receptacle for the clinician's",

Disengagement and reorientation\nsuggestions.  Rather,  the  client  is  an  active  force  in  shaping  the  interaction,  and  the\nclinician must respond meaningfully to the unique responses of the individual. Guiding the person into hypnosis may be a more accurate representation of the clinician's role. In the  capacity  of  guide,  you  cannot  know  the  exact  experience  the  client  is  having  or  is going to have, and so giving the client room to experience hypnosis in his or her own way is  not  only  desirable but necessary .  The process of guiding a person into hypnosis is a large responsibility to assume as you make yourself a primary focal point, for the client is now focusing himor herself on the experiences you stimulate through your communications.\nHypnotic interaction can be thought of as taking place in at least four general stages, as Table 4 above suggests. Each stage can be broken down even further into subcomponents, and these involve the detailed considerations about doing hypnosis stepby-step which are presented throughout this book.\nPrior  to  the  first  phase,  orienting  the  client  to  hypnosis  and  securing  his  or  her attentional  absorption,  the  clinician  has  already  introduced  hypnosis  to  the  client, explained  its  merits  and  purposes,  and  established  a  therapeutic  alliance.  When  the clinician  says  some  variation  of,  'All  right,  let's  begin…you  can  arrange  yourself  in  a comfortable  position,'  to  signal  the  induction  process  is  about  to  begin,  he  or  she  has clearly oriented the person to hypnosis. He or she has also indicated that the client should now strive to narrow his or her focus to the clinician's suggestions and the immediate matters at hand. All of the preparations for the hypnotic experience discussed in previous chapters are parts of this particular phase: the discussion concerning personal motivation to change; conceptions about hypnosis; defining personal goals; identifying the specifics of  the  symptomatology (i.e.,  origin,  course,  and  quality  of  symptoms);  assessing  client responsiveness (either from formal assessments or informally from the responses to your guidance in the interaction); choosing and applying a communication style; and moving through the interaction in a goal-directed fashion.\nThis  chapter  considers  the  second  phase  of  the  hypnotic  interaction,  the  hypnotic induction  and  the  intensifying  ('deepening')  of  the  client's  hypnotic  experience.  The process of hypnotic induction serves several purposes:\n1. It provides a concrete stimulus for the client to focus his or her attention on, serving as a bridge between the 'normal waking state' and the experience of hypnosis.\n2. It engages and occupies the person's conscious mind, and in so doing effectively dissociates it from other competing awarenesses while simultaneously amplifying the unconscious mind's associational abilities. In fact, this is the chief function of an induction: facilitating the dissociation of conscious and unconscious functions. The degree of dissociation achieved is a relative measure of the depth of the hypnotic experience.\n3. It allows for the building of a 'response set,' a characteristic pattern of responding to the guidance of the clinician, discussed at length in the previous chapter.\nThe induction process as the stimulus for the experience of hypnosis obviously plays an important role in the overall quality of the interaction, and consequently, deciding which induction  to  employ  is  a  matter  worthy  of  extra  consideration.  There  are  as  many induction methods as there are practitioners of hypnosis, and since it is neither practical nor desirable to list them all I have included only several of the more common and useful\nones.  I  have  divided  the  methods  of  induction  into  two  general  categories:  formal, structured inductions; and informal, conversational approaches. This chapter will present some of the formal inductions, while some of the informal ones are discussed in the next chapter.",

        "text": "The formal, structured inductions in this chapter represent the more traditional approaches to doing hypnosis. In using the term 'traditional' to describe these inductions, I have two meanings. The first is for the literal meaning of the word 'traditional.' These techniques have been effectively used for a very long time, handed down from generation to generation of hypnotists. My second meaning of traditional is for the association to a more  traditional  model  of  hypnosis  in  which  the  process  of  hypnotic  induction  is generally  more  highly  directive  and  ritualistic.  The  traditional  model  emphasizes  the value  of  a  formal  and  standardized  ritual  of  induction  in  order  to  clearly  define  the interaction as hypnosis, and to assess the hypnotic capacity of the client. The emphasis, therefore,  is  on  determining  how  well  a  client  can  respond  to  an  impersonal  set  of suggestions, a marked contrast to the notion of adapting the approach to the client. The Spiegels  (1978,  p.  28)  described  the  basis  for  approaching  hypnotic  induction  in  this invariant and structured way as follows:\nBy  using  a standardized induction procedure, which  involves  systematic questioning regarding physiological, behavioral and phenomenological responses, the variable influence of different operators on the trance performance  is minimized  and  the  trance capacity of a subject can be systematically documented.\nEach of the formal, structured inductions, if not scripted word for word, has at the very least key phrases and key concepts that are integral to the technique, defining them. Thus, these key phrases and concepts must necessarily be present in order for that technique to be employed. In  doing hypnosis for the purpose of catalyzing some therapeutic shift in the client's experience, a clinician might choose to employ a structured approach, yet still vary at least some of the wording according to the individual needs or characteristics of the client (Weitzenhoffer, 2000).\nThese  techniques  are  invaluable  in  the  practice  of  clinical  hypnosis,  and  should  be mastered as basic approaches to hypnosis. Experience will prove to you quite dramatically that you will get a wide range of reactions to the same exact technique, such is  the  tremendous  variation  among  people.  One  of  the  most  important  skills  in  doing effective hypnosis is being observant enough to notice and use the responses you get in order to either amplify or shift away from what you are doing. If what you are doing isn't working  for  some  reason,  you  can  have  the  flexibility  to  smoothly  shift  to  a  different technique  and/or  style.  Stopping  midway  through  a  particular  technique  is  a  perfectly acceptable and even desirable thing to do when that technique isn't getting the response you want.  The  key  to  making  such  a  midstream  switch  smoothly  is  in  the  transitional statement you make to the client leading from where you were to where you are going.\nYou should never comment, 'Well, that wasn't working, so let's try this.' Instead, you can offer something more accepting and natural such as:\nThat's right…you can continue to feel yourself shifting in the chair, wanting to relax…and  you  can  begin  to  realize  that  paying  attention  to  me  isn't  really necessary to have as soothing an experience as you'd like, and isn't it nice to know that you don't have to listen to me…and so why not let your mind drift off to something else it finds even more comforting than the things I'm talking about….\nSuch statements give the client permission to have his or her experience of hypnosis in his or her own way without confrontation of so-called resistance.\nEach  of  the  techniques  presented  in  the  remainder  of  this  chapter  will  include  a discussion  of  some  of  the  basic  concepts  involved  in  the  technique  as  well  as  a  brief sample of the method.",

        "text": "In beginning an induction, there are generally certain minimal responses you will want from the client. None of these are essential, since people can even experience hypnosis and generate hypnotic phenomena while active and alert, but they are basic to clinical contexts where putting the client at ease and building receptivity are crucial.\nSuggesting,  directly  or  indirectly,  that  the  client  assume  a  comfortable  physical position is a good starting point. The general immobility (catalepsy) and the extra effort it takes to readjust one's position while in hypnosis make it necessary to be sure the client is in a comfortable position he or she can remain in effortlessly over time.\nA second consideration may be to suggest a comfortable rate of breathing; you may notice  with  experience  that  a  sense  of  anticipation  and  fascination  sometimes  lead  the client to breathe irregularly and even hold breaths unconsciously. It helps to relax people to encourage a slowed and more rhythmic breathing.\nA third consideration is helping the client turn his or her focus increasingly inward, and so suggesting that the client close his or her eyes at the start is generally a good idea. Eye closure blocks out external distractions, encourages  internal absorption, and thus facilitates the induction. (An exception to this is the 'Eye Fixation' technique induction, described later in this chapter, which encourages eye closure as the basis for the induction itself rather than as a lead-in to induction.) Suggesting the client close his or her eyes can be  done  directly  or  indirectly.  Generally,  I  just  ask,  'Can  you…close  your  eyes?'  (an embedded  question)  which  people  routinely  take  as  a  directive  to  do  so  and  respond accordingly. Modeling eye closure is also a good technique; you can close your own eyes while suggesting to the client, 'You can close your eyes…now…and allow yourself to relax  comfortably.'  (Don't  keep your eyes  closed,  though,  because  the  only  source  of information about your client's responses is your client, and he or she will be much too difficult to see if your eyes are closed!)\nThe final consideration at this beginning point is to use whatever behaviors the client offers as the basis for going into hypnosis. This can be accomplished by commenting on\nthem and tying them to suggestions of relaxation  and  entering  hypnosis.  For  example, 'each shift in your chair can make you more comfortable…. Each breath you take in can soothe and relax your body…'\nWith the client comfortable and growing more responsive to the clinician, the hypnotic induction  can  now  get  under  way.  Here,  then,  are  specific  techniques  for  eliciting hypnosis.",

        "text": "Relaxation  reduces  stress,  anxiety,  fear  of  change,  and  defensiveness,  and  provides  a sense of empowerment to the client. Things can simply seem more manageable. Hypnosis is much,  much  more  than  just  relaxation,  but  relaxation  is  commonly  used  as  a therapeutic stepping-stone for all of these reasons (Murray-Jobsis, 1993).\nThe progressive muscle relaxation technique involves offering suggestions of relaxation  of  the  various  muscle  groups  of  the  body  sequentially  (Coe,  1993;  Kirsch, Lynn, & Rhue, 1993). The body is divided into as few or as many specific muscle groups as you wish, depending on how long or short you think the induction process need be. You can start with the client's head and work downward to his or her feet, or vice versa, as a matter of personal preference. (One of the questions I am asked most often is where in  the  body  to  begin.  Working  downward  carries  an  implication  of  going  'down  into hypnosis,' but physical relaxation is generally easier to accomplish than is mental, and working upward leaves the person's mind last in the sequence. In my experience, it's six of one and half a dozen of the other in terms of which direction of sequencing is better.)\nA progressive muscle relaxation technique may sound like this:\nIn just a moment I will begin to describe the various muscles of your body…and as I describe them relaxing you can notice how easily those muscles begin to relax…and  how  much  more  comfortable  you  feel  as  they  do…and  as  you continue to breathe comfortably at a slow and easy rate…you can notice how the muscles of your feet can relax now…you can feel the muscles of your toes, your arches, your ankles all relaxing wonderfully easily, even feeling the tingle of  comfort  soothing  those  muscles,  relaxing  you  easily…and  now  you  can notice how  the  muscles  of  your  calves and  shins relax, growing  more comfortable moment by moment…and now the muscles around your knees can relax…and  now  the  muscles  of  your  thighs  can  feel  more  at  ease  and comfortable…and now the muscles of your hips and buttocks can relax…and now you can notice the muscles of your abdomen and lower back growing loose and comfortable…and as the muscles of your back and chest relax with each breath,  you  can  feel  more  and  more  at  ease…and  then  your  arms  can  grow heavier and more comfortable…and now your neck muscles can grow loose and limp…and finally the muscles of your face and head can relax and leave you feeling so comfortable, more relaxed than you've been in a long, long time….\nThe above example is an abbreviated version of what can be a lengthier and more drawnout process. You can be as repetitious and as slow with your suggestions of comfort at each  specific  muscle  group  as  the  client  may  require.  The  pace  at  which  you  move\nthrough the sequence has to be based on the client's reactions. You can take longer if the client is quite tense, or move along at a faster pace if the client is able to get comfortable quickly. A client who is either hurried by too rapid a pace or bored by too slow a pace is likely to be too easily distracted and disengaged from the induction process. Remember, when your suggestions don't fit well with the client's ongoing experience, they are much easier to reject.\nThe progressive muscle relaxation technique can take a considerable amount of time to do  (perhaps  as  much  as  20  minutes),  but  usually  only  at  first.  With  repetition,  the association of relaxation is formed to your mere mention of bodily relaxation, and usually after a short while of the client practicing this technique, the relaxation response comes quite quickly. After a period of practice, simply going through the naming of the body parts  in  sequence  without  providing  all  the  detailed  suggestions  of  relaxation  will  still elicit  the  relaxation  response  from  the  client  as  a  result  of  conditioning.  This  is  what makes  a  lengthy,  detailed  technique  in  the  beginning  have  practical  value  for  later sessions;  otherwise  an  inordinate  amount  of  time  would  be  spent  on  just  doing  an induction  each  session.  It  is  invaluable  to  tape-record  your  inductions  and  provide  the tape to your clients to speed up the conditioning process and to provide them a means of getting comfortable even in your absence.\nA second variation on the progressive muscle relaxation technique involves the same conditioning or association principle. By using a countdown (i.e., associating a number to each  muscle  group,  e.g.,  '10…relax  your  feet…9…relax  your  calves  and  shins…')  as part of the process, in later sessions you can simply count downward in the established sequence  and  each  number  can  trigger  the  associated  relaxation  response  for  that particular muscle group.\nA third  variation  of  the  progressive  muscle  relaxation  technique  is  called  the  'Deep Muscle Relaxation' technique. In this technique, the sequential progression through the body is the same, but the client is additionally instructed to deliberately tense the muscles of the specific group under consideration. Have the client hold the tension in the muscles for 10 seconds or so, and then release it. The obvious relaxation of the muscles is both immediate and substantial. Try this yourself: Make a tight fist, and hold it tightly for 10 or 15 seconds. You'll quickly notice your hand getting warmer, then tingly, and after a short while it can actually begin to shake with the exaggerated tension you create. When you just can't hold the tension in your fist anymore, let go and allow your hand to relax. Feel how relaxed the muscles are? Now imagine how you would feel if you did that with every muscle in your body! The relaxation can be quite profound. This is an especially good technique for very concrete people who need direct and immediate experience of the  contrast  between  tension  and  relaxation,  and  also  for  those  who  generally  have difficulty  relaxing.  The  tense-release  protocol  works,  in  part,  because  physiologically, when  a  muscle  tenses,  it must relax  before  it  can  tense  again.  The  muscle  enters  a 'refractory period.' You can even preface the 'sure success' of this technique with this explanation of muscle physiology to the client. (What you don't need to tell him or her, however, is that the refractory period lasts only a fraction of a second.)\nThe  variations  of  the  progressive  muscle  relaxation  are  among  the  easiest  and  most effective inductions to perform. One word of caution, though. Most people I know who use hypnosis tend to use inductions that they find personally pleasing. I recommend you\ndo inductions with the client's needs in mind, and not according to which work best on you  With each induction you learn, it would be wise to consider for whom the induction . would  be  perfect,  and  for  whom  it  would  be  lousy. For  example,  progressive  muscle relaxation focuses people on their body. Thus, using this body-oriented technique with someone in pain is not recommended. Can you see why?",

        "text": "This technique involves offering suggestions to the client to experience him- or herself in some special place where he or she can feel relaxed, secure, and have a general sense of well-being. As you describe details of that special place, the client can experience getting more and more absorbed in the suggested sensations of being there.\nTo begin, you can directly ask the client if he or she has a special place where he or she likes  to  go  to  relax,  escape  from  the  daily  stresses,  or  to  simply  be  comfortable.  If  the client can provide such a place, then feeding back to the client suggestions to experience the  soothing  characteristics  of  that  place  may  be  used  in  the  induction.  A  second possibility is for you to choose a place for the client that you're reasonably confident will be a relaxing place for him or her. This is a potentially hazardous choice to make blindly since you cannot know the client's experience of the place you've chosen unless you ask. If you choose the place for the client, it is important to ask, 'Have you ever been to (the beach, the mountains, Disneyland…)? How would you describe your experience in being there?' Not asking for feedback in this way creates the possibility that you may take the client to a place you enjoy but your client does not. Of course, nonverbal feedback from your client is also valuable as you progress with your induction, but that develops after you  have  already  begun  rather  than  employing  a  preventa-tive  approach  before  you begin.  A  third  possibility  is  to  avoid  the  mention  of  a  specific  place  at  all  in  your induction process, using contentless suggestions to facilitate the experience. I'll say more about this alternative shortly.\nIn providing the details of the special place to the client, using the sensory-based terms the client uses in describing his or her experience of that place can allow him or her to get more deeply absorbed in the suggested experience since you're using the details the client has already told you are significant. Providing additional suggested experiences in other sensory modalities can round out the induction and allows for a fuller experience of being in  that  place  for  the  moment.  The  more  involvement  the  client  has  in  the  suggested experience, the more dissociated a state he or she is in, detached from the immediacy of current goings-on elsewhere, allowing for a more meaningful hypnotic experience.\nThe following is a sample of a content-filled relaxed-scene experience induction. The suggestions  all  relate  to  the  experience  of  being  at  the  beach,  and  begin  with  visually oriented suggestions which  then lead into auditorily and kinesthetically oriented suggestions:\n… Sometime in your life you have had the experience of being very near to the ocean and seeing it in all of its beauty and vastness…and you can begin to see the ocean in your mind's eye now…huge and mysterious, and for as far as you can  see  the  ocean  covers  the  earth…and  way  out  on  the  horizon  you  can  see\ndistant ships and boats that sail the waters…and you can see the rolling waves in front  of  you  gently  and  rhythmically  lap  up  on  the  beach…and  you  can  even hear them as they softly roll back into the ocean…and the gentle sound of the waves is so soothing a sound…and you can feel the cool ocean breeze on your face…so refreshing and yet so relaxing…soothing and calming you so deeply….\nWhatever special place you happen to use, whether a beach, a forest, an art museum, or any place the client finds comfort in, that place is probably full of sensory delights that you can use to ease your client into hypnosis. Use as much sensorily descriptive language as you can in order to facilitate a full experience for the client. The more sensory details you provide that fit, the more the client has to associate him- or herself to that place. One word of caution, though. It is also true that the more detail you provide, the more you may unintentionally provide suggestions that don't fit.\nThe  solution is to use process (contentless) suggestions for the relaxed scene experience. When you provide few or no details at all, the client must provide his or her own in response to your general suggestions, thus reducing the likelihood of mismatches. A  disadvantage  to  the  process  form  of  this  induction,  however,  is  its  briefer,  more repetitious nature. Without the details of the experience, there is considerably less to talk about.\nA contentless or process-based version of the relaxed scene induction might sound like this:\nAs you continue to sit there comfortably with your eyes closed, you can let your mind  drift  back  to  the  pleasurable  memory  of  some  special  place,  perhaps  a special place that you've been to where you felt so good…so comfortable and secure and happy…or perhaps a place that you'd like to create and go to where you can fully sense how very peaceful you can feel inside when there…and you can  allow  yourself  to  go  to  that  place  right  now,  in  your  mind…you  can  feel yourself there, feeling the comfortable feelings you'd like to feel there…and you can notice the specific sounds of that relaxing place, soothing you…and you can see  in  your  mind  the  images  of  that  place,  noticing  how  pleasing  this  special place is to you…and you can feel so good there….\nGoing on and on about the sensory details of that place is possible without your having any  idea  where  the  special  place  is  your  client  chose!  Anywhere  the  client  can  feel comfortable is sufficient in order for this technique to be effective. Notice in the sample the suggestion for 'a place you'd like to create and go to.' In the event the client doesn't have a place in his or her experience where he or she felt good to go to (a common issue in working with people with a history of abuse), he or she can then imagine creating such a  place.  That  'safe  place'  can  be  a  very  helpful  tool  in  later  sessions  beyond  hypnotic induction (Rhue & Lynn, 1993; Smith, 1993; Spiegel, 1993).",

        "text": "If  not  the  oldest,  certainly  one  of  the  oldest,  techniques  for  inducing  hypnosis  is  the classic  'eye-fixation'  method.  Popularized  in  movies,  and  often  employed  by  classical\npractitioners,  this  technique  involves  having  the  client  fixate  his  or  her  gaze  on  some specific stimulus (Spiegel & Spiegel, 1978; Weitzenhoffer, 2000). The stimulus can be virtually anything: a spot on the ceiling or wall, the clinician's thumb, a dangling watch or crystal ball, a fireplace, a candle, an aquarium, an hourglass, whatever. Anything that holds  the  client's  attention  long  enough  for  him  or  her  to  respond  to  the  concurrent suggestions for relaxation will suffice in this technique.\nAs the client stares at the stimulus, suggestions are offered encouraging him or her to notice  every  observable  detail,  and  that  while  fixing  his  or  her  gaze  he  or  she  can experience his or her eyes growing more relaxed and even tired. There is a little bit of trickery in this technique when done properly; the client's eyes should be elevated in their sockets as he or she stares at the stimulus, which then allows physiology to work in the clinician's fa-vor. Eyestrain naturally occurs, and thus the client will, in fact, experience the heaviness and tiredness in his or her eyes just as the clinician has suggested. But, the client  naturally  attributes  the  sensations  of  fatigue  to  the  clinician's  suggestions,  not physiology, and as a result the clinician's credibility can rise. Personally, I am not a fan of this technique, but it is so commonly used by so many I thought it necessary to include it in this text. In that way, you can be in a position to decide for yourself what is useful and what isn't. Why am I not a fan of this approach? Eye closure may take a while to get as a response with some clients, and so can unnecessarily become a battleground in the 'test of wills' between client and clinician. Older literature has often devoted a great deal of consideration to what you should do when an inordinate amount of time has passed and the client has still not closed his or her eyes (generally recommending it be treated as resistance, analyzing and confronting it). I find it much easier to just suggest eye closure and get on with the rest of the induction process.\nAn eye fixation  induction  method  might  sound  like  this  one,  done  permissively  and contentlessly:\nAs you listen to the sound of my voice, you can let your eyes search the room and  find  some  spot  or  some  thing  that  is  of  particular  interest  to  you…  And when you find that particular object you can let your head begin to gently drop down while you allow your eyes to look upward toward that object… That's right… And now you can continue to look at it, and you can notice every detail about the way it looks…and as you continue to relax and look at it, have you noticed how tired your eyes have become?…and as focus your eyes intently on that object…. Your eyes can grow more tired, your eyelids can seem to become heavier and heavier…and as soon as you realize that it takes too much effort to keep your eyes open, you can let them drop down…and as they drop down you can drop into a very comfortable state of physical and mental relaxation….\nCommenting  on  the  client's  blinking,  pacing  your  words  to  the  eye  blinks,  and  even modeling  eye  closure  can  further  enhance  your  suggestions  for  eye  closure.  If  after  a reasonable period of time (don't hurry!) the client still has not closed his or her eyes, you can  either  switch  techniques  or  simply  suggest  he  or  she  close  his  or  her  eyes  in  a relatively direct way, such as: 'You can close your eyes… now .'  If  you still  do  not get eye closure, you can ask the client about what he or she is experiencing: 'You haven't\nclosed  your  eyes  yet,  for  some  reason…and  as  you  become  aware  of  the  reason…  if you'd like you can tell me that reason…and thereby make it even easier for you to get comfortable…' Or, as another alternative, you can match the client by encouraging him or  her  'to  keep  your  eyes  open…as  you  learn  something  meaningful…with  eyes  wide open…'\nEven with his or her eyes open, the client can still be in hypnosis, as discussed earlier. Keen  observation  will  tell  you  this  and  perhaps  save  you  needless  self-doubts  or confrontations over whether the client is experiencing hypnosis 'properly.'",

        "text": "Counting methods of induction generally involve counting downward (implying 'going down' deeper into  hypnosis)  and  in  between  numbers  steadily  offering  suggestions  of relaxation and comfort (Erickson, Rossi, & Rossi, 1976). At first, the slower and more detailed  the  process  between  numbers,  the  better.  As  in  the  progressive  relaxation techniques,  the  client  can  become  conditioned  through  experience  and  posthypnotic suggestions to need fewer and fewer suggestions between numbers until deep hypnosis can be accomplished with just a simple countdown.\nThis technique is popular because of its simplicity, evidenced in the following sample:\nIn just a moment I'm going to begin counting downward from the number 10 to 1…and as I count slowly downward you can relax a little more deeply with each number…and  when  I  eventually  reach  the  number  1…you  will  begin  to discover how  easily you can experience yourself as very relaxed and comfortable…and  I'll  begin  now  with  the  number  10…relaxing  comfortably and  breathing  in…and  out…at  a  rate  that's  comfortable  for  you…and  9, relaxing even more comfortably, feeling the relaxation grow a little more with each moment that passes…and 8, feeling so much more at ease…and 7 times more comfortable than you were just a couple of minutes ago…and 6… I can think of half a dozen good reasons to be even more comfortable…5, etc., etc., 4, 3, 2, 1…\nA variation involves having the client do the counting out loud downward from 100 while the clinician intersperses suggestions of relaxation. Furthermore, the clinician can offer the  suggestion  that  when  the  client  'soon  discovers  it  takes  too  much  effort  to  first remember and then say the next number,' he or she can stop counting and go even deeper into  hypnosis.  Rarely  have  I  encountered  someone  who  continued  to  count  below  the number 80.\nA variation  on  the  same  theme  is  to  complicate  matters  a  little  by  having  the  client count  backwards  by  7  from  1,000  (or  some  comparable  numbers)  as  you  offer suggestions for relaxation. This ends up requiring so much mental energy that it is a relief to the client to be able to stop counting and just drop into hypnosis!",

        "text": "Generally  a  good  method  for  more  'difficult'  clients,  this  pattern  involves  no  direct suggestion to the client to respond in a particular way, but rather to act 'as if' he or she were responding in the way suggested (Edgette & Edgette, 1995). For example, 'you can arrange yourself in a comfortable position as if you were going to relax deeply…and you can close your eyes as if you were going to focus inwardly…' In terms of the outcome, where the act ends and the reality of hypnosis begins is ambiguous since the responses are virtually identical (Sarbin, 1997; Spanos & Coe, 1992).\nTo provide an idea of how this technique might be used, here is a sample of Milton Erickson using a variation of it with Richard Bandler and John Grinder as they described in their book, Frogs into Princes (1979, p. 136):\nMilton  said  to  me  'You  don't  consider  yourself  a  therapist,  but  you  are  a therapist.'  And  I  said,  'Well,  not  really.'  He  said  'Well,  let's  pretend…that you're  a  therapist  who  works  with  people.  The  most  important  thing…when you're pretending this…is to understand…that you are really not… You are just pretending… And if you pretend really well, the people that you work with will pretend to make changes. And they will forget that they are pretending…for the rest of their lives. But don't you be fooled by it.'\nSuggesting  that  a  client  act  'as  if'  he  or  she  is  comfortable,  relaxed,  thinking  about  a happy moment, or whatever, can pave the way for the client to experience the effects of the suggestions without having to respond to any real demands being made.",

The  traditional  models  of  hypnosis,  which  view  the hypnotic capacity of the client as the primary factor in successful hypnosis, have placed a greater  emphasis  on  depth  of  hypnosis  than  does  the  utilization  approach.  Just  how deeply  in  hypnosis  does  the  client  need  to  be?  A  deeper  hypnotic  experience  isn't necessarily  a  clinically  more  successful  one,  and  so  generally  you  only  need  an experience deep enough to be effective. Simply put, if the client is only lightly engaged yet integrates and applies what you offer, it was deep enough. Achieving deep hypnosis may  not  always  be  necessary,  but  it  can  allow  for  certain  possibilities  (e.g.,  fuller dissociations) that make familiarity with deepening techniques necessary.",

        "text": "In this deepening technique, the client is encouraged to imagine (i.e., see, hear, feel) himor  herself  at  the  top  of  a  flight  of  'special  stairs'  or  on  a  'special  elevator'  (Watkins, 1987). As he or she imagines going 'down the stairs slowly one step at a time, you can go\ndown even more deeply into hypnosis.' Or, 'as you pass each floor while you gradually descend  in  the  elevator,  you  can  experience  yourself  going  even  more  deeply  into  the comfort of hypnosis.' Here's a brief sample of how this technique might sound:\nI wonder whether you can imagine yourself standing at the top of a set of very special stairs, the stairs of relaxation…and as you see and even feel yourself at the top of the stairs…you can be very comfortable…and you can take the first step down…and as you take a step down the stairs of relaxation, you can step down into  an  even  deeper  state  of  comfort…you  can  relax  so  very  deeply… And  now  you  can  take  another  step  down,  going  even  deeper  into  a  very comfortable,  profoundly  absorbed  state  of  mind  and  body…and  then  you  can take another step down going even deeper…\nEach step down is emphasized as a 'step down deeper' into hypnosis. It is a good idea to make  sure  beforehand  that  the  client  doesn't  have  any  negative  associations  to  going downstairs (e.g., childhood spankings in the basement) or riding in an elevator. If he or she does, then use a different deepener.",

As  you  may  recall,  verbal compounding involves the tying of one suggestion to another according to the generic formula, 'As you X, you can Y' (e.g., 'As you close your eyes, you can take in a deep, relaxing  breath').  Besides  smoothing  the  delivery  of  the  process,  verbal  compounding also serves as a deepener by continually building new responses onto the foundation of past responses, thereby intensifying the hypnotic experience.\n'Manual compounding' involves the tying of  verbal deepening suggestions  to  some suggested  physical  experience.  It  generally  takes  the  form  of  offering  suggestions  for going  deeper  into  hypnosis  while  experiencing  physical  sensations  that  reinforce  the suggestions. For example, assuming permission has been obtained to touch the client, you can  gently  push  downward  on  the  client's  shoulder(s)  while  suggesting  'you  can  feel yourself sinking even more deeply into comfort.' Or, you can raise his or her hand, and suggest: 'As I slowly and gently drop your hand back down to your side, you can drop slowly and gently even deeper into hypnosis.' The physical sensations of 'down' (from the push down on the shoulder or the hand dropping) can amplify the verbal suggestions of 'down' and make the experience a more profound one as a result.",

This technique involves offering suggestions about imagining  the  presence  of  a  'mind's  eye'  as  the  part  of  the  mind  remaining  active  in thinking and imaging even as the body relaxes. By being offered suggestions similar to the 'Eye Fixation' suggestions of the 'eyelids getting heavy' for the 'mind's eyelid,' the\nclient  can  slowly  close  out  stray  thoughts  and  images  as  the  mind's  eyelid  closes  and thereby have a deeper experience. It might sound something like this:\n… Just as you have eyes that can see the world around you, you have an inner eye  that  you  can  call  the  'mind's  eye'…and  it  can  see  images  and  process thoughts even as you relax deeply…and you can think of your mind's eye as having an eyelid…and like your physical eyes your mind's eyelid can gradually grow more tired and heavy, and it can begin to drop…and as it begins to close it slowly  closes  out  stray  thoughts  and  stray  images  and  can  leave  your  mind perfectly quiet and open and free to experience whatever you'd like…and it's closing more and more…and your mind grows more quiet, more restful…and now your mind's eye can close…and close out any stray thoughts or images you don't want to interfere with how relaxed you are….\nThis  technique  is  an  effective  way  of  'turning  off'  much  of  the  distracting  or  even unpleasant  internal  dialogue  that  goes  on  continuously  in  many  of  us,  thereby  making deeper hypnosis easier to accomplish.",

Following an induction, suggestions can be offered to the effect that the client can now 'have some silent time to enjoy  the  deep  relaxation  of  hypnosis  and  the  wonderful  quiet  inside;  you  can  even deepen your level of comfort.'\nYou may wish to preface the period of silence with an indicator of how long you will be silent (e.g.,  'You can take 60 seconds of clock time to enjoy a silent period during which you can deepen your relaxation even more…'), or you may instead suggest that your client signal you when he or she is ready to proceed.\nIt is almost always a good idea to give some protective suggestion to the client in the form of an 'anticipation signal' so when you begin to speak to the client again after a period of silence, your voice will continue to soothe the client and not startle him or her. During the period of silence the client can be so absorbed in his or her internal experience that he or she forgets anyone else is even there!\nHere's a helpful hint: The use of silence as a deepener can also provide you with an opportunity to compose yourself and think of what the next step in the treatment plan is. In other words, it is a prime time in the process for the client to go deeper into hypnosis while you figure out what you'd like to do next!",

        "text": "This  deepening  technique,  also  called  'refractionation,'  is  the  deepening  technique  of choice with those clients whose attention spans are diminished by their symptoms. That includes deeply depressed, highly anxious, pain and attention-deficit clients. Refractionation can help build a better attention span.\nThe technique involves giving the client already in hypnosis a posthypnotic suggestion that  the  next  time  you  do  hypnosis  together  he  or  she  can  go  into  hypnosis  both  more\nquickly and deeply. The person is brought out of hypnosis, then after brief discussion is invited to go back into hypnosis, ideally going into hypnosis more quickly and deeply as suggested. The clinician thus guides the person in and out of hypnosis several times in the same session, each time for just a little longer.\nStage hypnotists gain their  greatest  notoriety  for  the  way  they  use  this  technique.  A posthypnotic suggestion is given during the pre-show phase of suggestibility testing that when  the  hypnotist  commands  'Sleep!'  or  snaps  his  or  her  fingers,  the  subject  will instantly  re-enter  hypnosis.  Naturally,  the  audience  is  baffled  and  fascinated  by  the 'power' of the hypnotist whose subjects enter hypnosis at an unbelievably rapid rate as the dramatic subjects even fall out of their chairs!\nSome clinicians establish what is called a 'cue word' or 'cue symbol' that the client is to use as a rapid means for entering hypnosis. Building such a cue simply allows for less induction  time  and  more  time  to  use  the  hypnosis  therapeutically.  Thus,  the  use  of posthypnotic suggestion and re-induction as a deepening technique is a useful one, with the qualification that if a 'cue' is used it be one that is more gentle and respectful than a harsh command to 'sleep' or a finger snap. The best cues, in my opinion, are the most subtle ones, such as a gradual change in your voice to the voice qualities associated with your  'hypnotic  voice.'  The  association  to  entering  hypnosis  in  response  to  the  use  of your voice in a particular way allows a gentle transition from one style of interaction to another. Once the client has become experienced with entering hypnosis with you as a guide, such experiences can serve as a foundation for future experiences. In fact, making use of a client's previous hypnotic experiences is one of the conversational approaches to induction discussed in the next chapter.",

        "text": "The formal, structured hypnotic inductions presented in the previous chapter are based on the  general  assumption  that  the  experience  of  hypnosis  is  distinct  from  other  forms  of subjective experience and can be induced through some special, if not arbitrary, process. While most in the field readily acknowledge that hypnosis can occur spontaneously and a ritual of induction is unnecessary for hypnosis to occur (Lynn, Kirsch, Neufeld, & Rhue, 1996;  Watzlawick,  1985),  many practitioners  continue  to  employ  induction  procedures that provide a structure to which the client must try to adapt. When a client finds a way to respond to a counting method, for example, he or she is demonstrating an ability to get absorbed despite the  absence  of  relevance  for  the  numbers  as  a  source  of  personal meaning  or  comfort.  After  all,  what's  so  engaging  about  counting  numbers?  Yet,  the counting  methods,  and  other  techniques  similarly  structured,  actually  work  with  many people,  probably  for  the  reasons  Kirsch  (2000)  offered  when  he  described  the  role  of expectancy  in  responsiveness  and  further  suggested  that  an  induction  is  whatever  the client thinks of and expects an induction to be.\nThe utilization approach to hypnotic induction (Erickson, 1958, 1959; Erickson, Rossi, &  Rossi,  1976)  rests  on  different  assumptions  about  the  experience  of  hypnosis,  the nature of induction, and the goals in even doing hypnosis, that add a more complex and sophisticated dimension to working with hypnotic communication patterns.\nIn  the  utilization  approach,  hypnosis  is  viewed  as  a  natural  experience  occurring routinely in people. In adopting this perspective, one of the tasks of the skilled clinician is to  recognize  hypnotic  responses  as  they  naturally  occur  in  the  course  of  ongoing therapeutic  interaction  and  then  build  on  them  meaningfully  in  a  spontaneous  and conversational manner. Another one of the tasks is to organize hypnotic processes around the unique attributes of the client, adapting the approaches to his or her subjective style of relating, thinking, and behaving. Instead of saying, 'I'm going to name body parts while you focus on relaxing' (i.e., progressive muscle relaxation), an example of an approach that requires the client to try to adapt him- or herself to the clinician's chosen technique, the utilization approach instead strives to elicit from within the client the images, internal dialogue,  feelings,  and  behaviors  that  are  personally  meaningful  and  engaging  as  the basis for the induction and therapy. Zeig described the process this way:\nInitiating hypnotic induction is a little like fostering love. One cannot elicit an emotional state, such as love, by intoning, 'Go deeply into love.' Similarly, one does  not  elicit  hypnosis  by  commanding  a  passive  patient,  'Go  deeply  into trance.'\nNote  a  key  word  in  the  previous  sentence, elicit .  Hypnosis  is  elicited,  not\ninduced (despite the label 'induction')…. The  hypnotherapist establishes conditions  that  allow  the  patient  to  bring  forth  previously  dormant  trance components. (2001, p. 18)\nIn  other  words,  the  skilled  clinician  can  elicit  responses  from  hypnotic  patterns  of communication that capture the client's attention and focus him or her on experiences that will  be  personally  and  therapeutically  significant.  The  instructions  to  the  client  in  the conversational (Ericksonian, naturalistic, utilization) approach to hypnotic induction are typically more individualized, permissive, indirect, and process-oriented than other, more technique-oriented approaches. Furthermore, there is typically not as clear a beginning, middle, or end to the induction compared to the clearer transitions from phase to phase of the  hypnosis  session  found  in  the  more  structured,  content-oriented  approaches  of  the previous chapter.\nThe  spontaneity  required  to  'accept  and  utilize'  a  client's  communications  makes  it nearly  impossible  to  ritualize  (i.e.,  standardize)  the  practice  of  clinical  hypnosis  in  the utilization approach. For some, the lack of a rigid structure to the methods is a turn-off. For others that same trait is a turn-on, for the challenge of how to elicit a meaningful and therapeutically effective hypnotic experience in a particular person in a specific context is a formidable challenge, indeed. Implicit in this approach is the role of clinician as both guide  and  initiator  of  what  is  to  happen.  The  clinician's  responsibility  to  the  client  is greater  in  the  utilization  approach  because  the  client  is  assumed  to  be  capable  of  a meaningful  hypnotic  experience  if  a  more  individualized  and  flexible  approach  is employed.  This  is  a  marked  contrast  to  the  traditional  practice  of  assuming  successful hypnosis is more about the client's level of hypnotizability as measured by a standardized test than the quality of the therapeutic alliance or the flexibility of your approach.\nThe  stimulus  for  the  hypnotic  experience  in  the  utilization  approach  is  in  the unconscious associations (e.g., cognitive, sensory, emotional) the clinician triggers in the client through his or her communications. This perspective also differs considerably from the more traditional perspective that the power of the hypnotic suggestion is contained in the  suggestion  itself  rather  than  in  the  way  the  client  relates  to  it.  The  scripting  of inductions parallels the current trend toward the manualizing of therapies, or the empirical 'validating' of a therapy, as if what's therapeutic is inherent in the technique rather than in a person's response to the technique. Any therapy can be iatrogenic or antitherapeutic for some people who respond in idiosyncratic and negative ways. That's the key reason why  keeping  a  focus  on  the  individual  and  tailoring  approaches  to  him  or  her  is emphasized  throughout  this  text  as  a  means  for  minimizing  negative  responses,  even when  I  discuss  non-individualized  approaches.  Which  specific  associations  of  client experience will be triggered by your words cannot be predicted with certainty. Observing and using a client's responses as they arise will, of necessity, temper your approach.\nSecuring  and  maintaining  the  attention  of  the  client  is  a  beginning  point  for  the hypnotic  interaction.  Talking  about  the  issues  that  brought  the  person  into  treatment, telling engaging yet instructive stories that parallel the client's experience, and behaving in unexpected but goal-directed ways are three common techniques for securing a client's attention.  As  the  client's  focus  is  narrowed  to  the  clinician,  the  clinician  can  begin  to build on the client's responses by first acknowledging them and then suggesting (directly\nor  indirectly)  that  these  responses  can  serve  to  gradually  expand  his  or  her  range  of problem-solving  resources.  When  the  clinician  notices  hypnotic  responses  building (absorption, changes in breathing, a fixed posture, muscular tension dissipating, etc.), he or she can begin to engage the person in the process of induction and deepening through the naturalistic techniques described in this chapter.\nThe transition from routine conversation to hypnotic induction is a subtle one in this approach in comparison to the more formal, 'OK, close your eyes now and let's do some hypnosis,' approach. Induction is not necessarily announced to the client as a new phase the therapeutic interaction is entering, but can instead be eased into as a natural part of the progression of treatment. Whatever the client spontaneously does during this time is accepted and utilized as part of the process. Thus, the implicit message is, 'What you're doing right  now  is  what  will  allow  you  to  deepen  your  experience  further.'  Behaviors that  seem  'resistant'  (e.g.,  fidgeting,  smiling,  interrupting…)  are  accepted  and  used  as the basis for further suggestions,  redefining  them  as  acceptable  and  even  useful responses.\nThe skilled manipulation of the nonverbal components of the clinician's communications  is  always  a  major  factor  in  doing  hypnosis,  but  in  the  utili-zation approach it is especially so. Deliberate changes in your tone of voice, your quality of eye contact, and other analogical communications while shifting into an induction may serve as potential associations to entering hypnosis in this and future experiences. For example, using your 'hypnotic voice' (i.e., slower pace, quieter) selectively will predictably trigger hypnotic  responses  (i.e.,  communicate  an  invitation  to  your  client  to  enter  hypnosis) without having to say, 'Now I'm doing hypnosis' because those voice qualities became associated with hypnosis when you used them from the very first induction onward. This is but one example of how you can obtain hypnotic responses without directly asking for them. Your body posture, gaze, and breathing patterns are further examples of potential patterns on which\nto build hypnotic response associations. Table 5 below offers further hintsfor performing naturalistic inductions more skillfully. Most of these havealready been discussed at various times in the text while others will be presented here.\nThe methods for guiding a person into hypnosis described in this chapter are reliable ones. They have a structure, they have a vehicle for delivering the structure, but they are more  spontaneous  and  conversational  than  more  formal  approaches.  Each  involves narrowing the person's field of attention to his or her inner experiences, specifically the associations triggered by your suggestions. Resources long dormant in the client can be reactivated, memories long forgotten can be rediscovered, feelings long buried can be reexperienced, and issues long troublesome can be resolved.",

        "text": "Table 5. Conversational Induction Principles\nhave, at the least, experienced naturally occurring (i.e., spontaneous) hypnotic experiences that probably weren't thought of as being hypnosis yet can be identified as such by the clinician and used as examples of hypnosis to build upon in treatment (e.g., 'highway hypnosis,' unconscious or automatic behaviors). Many people, however, have experienced formal hypnosis at one time or another,  perhaps  in  educational  or  clinical contexts, where it was clear that hypnosis was occurring. These formal experiences can be even easier to build new hypnotic experiences upon.\nThe  induction  method  of  'Using  Past  Hypnotic  Experiences'  involves  two  general categories of previous hypnotic experiences on which to build: (1) Informal experiences with hypnosis, specifically the 'everyday hypnosis' experiences people have during the course of normal daily living; and, (2) Formal experiences with hypnosis, specifically the previous  time(s)  the  client  experienced  hypnosis  positively.  Either  approach  may  be offered  in  either  a  process-oriented  or  content-filled  structure,  described  later  in  this section.\nIn  the  first  approach  of  building  on  previous  informal  experience  with  hypnosis,  the phase  of  attentional  absorption  typically  involves  some  pre-induction  discussion  about the nature of hypnotic experience while exploring the client's associations to hypnosis. At some point, the clinician can begin to model increased attentiveness, immobility (i.e., catalepsy), slowed breathing, and can begin to hypnotically describe one or more natural situations in which  hypnosis occurs. Such  situations might include long drives, absorption in a good book or movie, during a massage or jacuzzi, daydreaming, praying, and  any  other  situation  in  which  the  person  has  had  the  direct  experience  of  being absorbed. The nonverbal shift from a normal pace and conversational tone of voice to one that is slower, quieter, and more meaningfully articulated is fundamental to guiding the\nperson into the suggested memory of that natural hypnotic state he or she has experienced (Lankton & Lankton, 1983). Through the absorption in that memory, hypnotic responses (i.e., the ideodynamics) naturally begin to occur in the here-and-now, which the clinician can  notice,  accept,  and  utilize  according  to  the  'As  you  experience  this,  you  can experience that' chaining formula. The client need not close his or her eyes in order to experience  hypnosis,  but  the  clinician  may  want  to  suggest  eye  closure  by  offering  a direct or indirect suggestion to do so. The following is a sample of how this technique may  sound,  using  a  previous  informal  hypnotic  experience  of  reading  with  indirect suggestions in the form of embedded commands to obtain specific responses:\nYou said earlier you enjoy reading a really good book… I really enjoy reading, too,  especially  when  I  have  some  quiet  time  all  to  myself…a time  for  quiet when I know I won't be interrupted…. It's such a luxury to have some time…to sit  quietly…and  not  have  to  do  anything…a  time  I  can  let  myself relax  so deeply … sitting in a way that is so comfortable …and you know what that's like, too…and how easy it is to sit quietly …just thinking… without moving for what can seem like a long, long time…and I like to read books that encourage you to experience yourself differently …that absorb you in different ways of thinking… different ways of feeling…books that allow you to expand yourself and change in beneficial ways …and you probably know quite well what I mean…how your mind can be so active in learning while your body gets even more comfortable with  each  page  you  turn …and  when  you  get  too  comfortable  to  keep  on reading, you can close your eyes and drift off …and I'd like to tell you about a book I read that may have special meaning for you….\nThe  above  induction  starts  out  conversationally,  then  turns  to  a  sharing  of  personal experience the client can relate to in order to build rapport while simultaneously slowing down and building associations to entering hypnosis. Then the shift takes place from 'I' to 'you,' with an emphasis on the client's experience building into a relaxed and focused state through the tonal emphasis on suggestive phrases. As the client becomes absorbed in the memory of relaxing and learning while reading, his or her responses can start to build in the current context and become the basis for transitioning into whatever hypnosis is to be done.\nThe above sample is obviously a content-filled one, providing details specific to the experience of reading. A process-oriented approach could also be employed, of which the following is an example:\nCan you think of a time when you were so involved in some deeply absorbing experience  that  you detached from and  even  forgot  to  notice  things  going  on around  you?  Every  person  has  had  experiences  like  that  where  …you find yourself  immersed in  some  activity…and  as you  relax …and  remember…and think about that kind of an experience…you can remember a specific experience like  that…one  that  was  especially  pleasant…where  you  were  so  into  it…you could lose track of time …and forget to notice outside sights and sounds …and only  your  sensations  and  thoughts  were  important…and  you  could feel  so wonderfully relaxed …sn't it nice to  know you can be so wrapped up in your\nthoughts…that people's voices fade away…and  you're alone with your thoughts…and feelings of comfort …and it's at times like that…and like this… that you can learn something important ….\nIn  the  above  sample,  the  process  of  becoming  absorbed  in  sensation  and  thought  is described, but no details of a specific context triggering such experiences are provided. Rather, the client provides those details for him- or herself when the suggestion is offered to choose a specific experience that was pleasant.\nIn the second approach building on formal experience with hypnosis, the typical preinduction  phase  discussion  can  focus  the  client's  attention  on  the  range  of  possibilities hypnosis allows, and how previous experience with hypnosis can make future experiences easier, more satisfying, and successful. It seems worthwhile to reiterate a point made in an earlier  chapter  about  exploring  the  nature  and  quality  of  the  client's  previous  hypnotic experience(s). If the client had a positive and meaningful experience with hypnosis, then the  clinician  has  a  solid,  positive  base  on  which  to  build.  If  the  client  had  a  negative experience with hypnosis, one that was unsuccessful at least or hurtful at most, then the clinician must exercise caution to refer back to the experience either as little as possible or in  a  detached  way  in  the  course  of  doing  hypnosis.  Questioning  the  client  about techniques  used  and  identifying  the  personal,  situational,  and  interpersonal  variables operating negatively at the time can save you from unwittingly duplicating a previously negative experience.\nIf  the  client  has  had  a  positive  experience  with  hypnosis  before,  a  content-filled approach to the use of the formal hypnotic experience can involve engaging the client in providing  an  ever-slowing,  detailed  account  of  the  experience.  This  approach  usually involves  a  large  degree  of  interaction  as  the  induction  progresses,  with  the  clinician simultaneously questioning the client, suggesting possible responses, and building on the client's responses as they occur. The mechanism of induction is structurally the same as in using informal previous hypnotic experiences; as the person becomes absorbed in the memory of hypnosis, the ideodynamic responses associated with that memory evolve in the  here-and-now.  The  clinician  notices,  accepts,  and  utilizes  those  responses,  building hypnotic responsiveness toward the goal of the interaction. The following is an example of this induction approach:\nClinician: You mentioned earlier that you experienced the comfort of hypnosis before, didn't you?\nClient: Yes. A couple of years ago I saw a doctor who did hypnosis for another problem I was experiencing.\nClinician: As you begin to think back now, can you recall how soothing and calming an experience hypnosis was?\nClient: Yes, I do remember feeling really relaxed. I didn't expect to be able to hear the doctor's voice, but I did. I wasn't sure I was hypnotized, but it felt really good.\nClinician: That's right…the experience of hypnosis can be so relaxing…so soothing…and you can remember how you were sitting then, can't you?\nClient: I guess so…(Readjusts position).\nClinician: That's right…sitting very comfortably now…and do you remember how good",

Client: (deep breath, eyes flutter closed) Yes.\nClinician: And you can probably recall what you heard then that allowed you to relax so deeply, can't you? And what did you hear that reminds you that you can be comfortable?\nClient: Just the doctor's voice…telling me to relax deeper and deeper…that it was as if I was floating….\nClinician: That's right, and you can remember what it's like to have that light, comfortable feeling everywhere in your body ….\nIn a sense, the client is acting as his or her own hypnotist, giving him- or herself the same suggestions  from  the  past  in  the  present,  and  the  clinician's  role  is  a  simple  one  of amplification.  The  client  already  knows  how  to  experience  hypnosis,  has  defined  it  as helpful,  and  reminds  him-  or  herself  in  detail  of  the  relaxed,  floating  nature  of  the hypnotic  experience  and,  in  so  doing,  unconsciously  recreates  it.  By  framing  the interaction as a 'discussion' about past experience rather than a set of current demands to respond  to,  the  suggestions  to  enter  hypnosis  are  less  direct,  more  permissive,  more natural to the interaction, and the issue of resistance is therefore largely avoided.\nTo use this kind of an approach in a process-oriented way, the interactional dimension of the induction can, if desired, be eliminated. The following is an example of the use of formal previous hypnotic experiences offered in a contentless way:\nYou mentioned earlier that you had an experience with hypnosis before that was a very relaxing and helpful one. If you'd like, you can begin to recall now many of  the  details  of  what  that  experience  was  like…remembering how your body can  be  so  comfortable …how your  breathing  can  begin  to  slow  down …and I wonder  whether  you'll  remember  how  comforting  it  can  be  to  simply sit quietly …in a comfortable position…while you listen to someone describe some ways that you can begin to experience yourself differently …and do you recall how good it felt to close your eyes? …and the memory of relaxing so deeply is still a part of you…even if you haven't had time lately to notice it…and isn't it nice  to rediscover  something  familiar  and  calming that  can  help  you?…and perhaps you can remember the room you were in when you learned how to feel good in this way …you can see the furniture and you can hear the sounds of that place, and as you remember the details of then… you can feel comfortable about that experience right now…\nThe context in which the client had his or her previous formal experience with hypnosis is not known to the clinician, nor does it need to be as long as the clinician is certain the experience was, in fact, a good one for the client by his or her own description.\nMaking  use  of  the  client's  previous  experience  with  hypnosis,  whether  formal  or informal, is one of the easiest yet most effective induction and deepening processes. It is a spontaneous, loosely structured approach that generates little resistance because 'we're not talking about now, we're talking about then ' The extra psychological distance makes a difference in increased comfort. In sum, the techniques involving use of past hypnotic",

        "text": "The experience of hypnosis has been described as one involving absorption, an intense concentration on some stimulus to the exclusion of others. Usually, but not always, the absorption  is  internally  directed.  In  doing  hypnosis,  guiding  the  client  into  hypnosis implies  having  the  client  selectively  attend  to  the  stimulus  of  the  clinician's  guidance, specifically becoming absorbed in the subjective associations triggered by the clinician's suggestions. By focusing intently on his or her internal experience, the client can suspend attentiveness  to  the  external  world,  diminish  reality-testing,  and  thereby  subjectively experience a wider range of possibilities.\nThe clinician's  role  is  to  facilitate  the  process  of  building  an  internal  focus  through suggestion.  In  routine  interaction,  therapeutic  or  otherwise,  people  are  expected  to  be more externally oriented and responsive to the other person. When one lapses into brief episodes  of self-absorption in social situations, it is considered  rude,  inattentive, disinterested, or is even considered evidence of (passive-aggressive) hostility. Yet, such episodes of internal absorption are normal, natural, frequent, and to be expected. In fact, in learning  and  doing  hypnosis,  part  of  the  difficulty  some  students  encounter  is developing the ability to stay externally focused on the client's responses as much as is humanly possible. If you are internally absorbed while doing hypnosis, you are going to miss a great deal of important nonverbal information communicated by your client during the process. Maintaining an attentive external focus on the client is the best way for the clinician to maintain a connection to the client by noticing and incorporating his or her responses into the induction.\nThe  induction  process  of  building  an  internal  focus  involves  offering  'pacing' statements  of  what external stimuli  the  client  is  currently  aware  of,  coupled  with 'leading'  statements  describing internal responses  the  client  may  begin  to  develop (Gilligan, 1987; Grinder & Bandler, 1981). This can be done in any ratio of pacing to leading statements the clinician judges to be useful. In other words, how many externally oriented suggestions of experience you offer for every internally oriented suggestion of experience is dependent solely on the responsiveness of the client.\nThe  assessment  can  be  made  early  on  in  your  interaction  with  the  client  as  to  how internally or externally absorbed he or she tends to be in the course of routine interaction. An  internal  or  external  orientation  in  relating  to  the  world  is  generally  a  fairly  stable characteristic of an individual, yet can and does vary markedly from situation to situation. Internal or external focus exists on a continuum, and no one can be exclusively one or the other  in  a  fixed  way.  Assessing  the  client's  direction  and  degree  of  focus  is  usually  a simple process of observing how the person communicates about his or her experience. Does he or she see him- or herself as responsible for his or her problem, or is he or she a victim of evil forces beyond his or her control? Is he or she sensitive to others' feelings and perceptions or is he or she blissfully unaware of others' feelings and reactions to him or her? Is he or she easily distracted from your interaction by external but routine things like a phone ringing or a plane flying overhead? Is or isn't he or she insightful about his\nor  her  experience?  Observations  along  these  lines  of  assessment  can  allow  you  the opportunity to formulate an induction and intervention that will more likely be effective.\nOnce you've assessed how internally or externally focused the client is at the time you would  like  to  begin  your  induction,  you  can  make  the  judgment  as  to  what  ratio  of external paces to internal leads you think would be effective, modifying it as necessary according  to  client  response.  Some  clients  are  already  so  internally  focused  at  the beginning point that you don't have to have much of an induction beyond, 'You can go into hypnosis, now.' Others may be so externally focused that they may require five or even ten external pacing statements before a single internal leading suggestion is offered.\nAs the induction progresses, fewer and fewer externally oriented statements are made while  more  and  more  internally  oriented  suggestions  are  offered.  The  following  is provided  as  an  example  of  this  induction  process  with  someone  deemed  moderately externally  oriented  at  the  start  of  the  induction.  To  help  you  distinguish  them,  an  (e) follows each externally oriented suggestion, and an (i) follows each internally oriented suggestion.\nYou're  sitting  in  that chair (e) and  you're  listening  to  me  describe  the experience of going into hypnosis (e)…and as you continue to look at me (e) you  may  notice  the  feel  of  the  chair  underneath  you,  supporting  your  body comfortably (e)…and as you notice the chair you can hear the phone ringing somewhere (e)…and isn't it soothing …to know you don't have to answer it and so you can let yourself relax easily (i)…and you can notice the wall behind me with its interesting pictures (e) and you may notice the objects on my desk (e)… and  as  you  look  around  the  room  you  can  hear  the  routine  sounds  of  this environment (e) and you can hear the sound of the world busily going on around you (e) and you can feel so good in realizing that your body can grow more at ease (i)…and your mind can begin to drift back to a pleasant memory (i)…and as your mind drifts back you can feel the texture of the chair on your fingertips (e) and as you notice how that texture feels you can also hear the things I have to say (e)…and as you listen you can become aware of a certain memory (i)… one that you feel is important that you'd like to re-experience and learn from (i) …a memory that may remind you of something you'd like to know now (i)…\nIn the above example, the induction starts with a series of statements that are pacing what the  client  is  currently  aware  of,  feeding  back  aspects  of  what  he  or  she is doing,  then offering a general statement of what he or she can experience. The number of paces to leads shifts as the induction progresses, gradually leading the client into re-experiencing an important memory.\nYou  may  notice  the  use  of  sensory  based  terms  in  visual,  auditory,  and  kinesthetic modalities. A way to further tailor the process to the individual is to deliberately choose the sensory modality of internal experience you want the client focused on. Many of the problems clients present clinically can be described in terms of internal or external focus on  a  particular  sensory  modality.  The  most  obvious  example  is  pain,  which  can  be thought of as an intense internal awareness on the kinesthetic level. Management of pain may, as you might predict, involve shifting the client's focus from internal to external, or\nfrom the kinesthetic modality to another one.\nMost  hypnotic  inductions  involve  building  an  internal  focus,  each  according  to  a different method. This induction provides the barest of frameworks for helping the client experience  hypnosis,  since  all  that  is  provided  here  is  a  structured  description  of  the process  as  shifting  the  client's  focus  from  external  to  internal  experience.  Which externals  and  which  internals  you  use  in  what  combination  in  which  modality  and  in which style  and  structure  make  for  a  huge  range  of  possibilities.  How  successful  your induction will be, as always, is determined primarily by how well you have assessed the client's  response  style  and  how  well  you  can  spontaneously  adjust  your  approach according to the feedback you get.",

        "text": "In  the  earlier  section  on  using  past  hypnotic  experiences  as  an  induction  strategy,  I described  how  putting  a  little  psychological  distance  between  the  desired  experiences 'now' by focusing on experiences from 'then' can make for less resistance. The use of metaphor is an even less direct induction approach, and so is even less likely to arouse resistance in the client. Rather than use the client's personal past experience as the basis for  induction,  metaphors  may  describe  some  other  person's  (or  animal's,  or  thing's) experience at some other time in some other place. Thus, the degree of removal is even greater and the possibility for personal threat reduced even further. As Jay Haley wrote:\nWhen  a  subject  resists  directives,  one  way  to  deal  with  the  problem  is  to communicate in terms of an analogy. If the subject resists A, the hypnotist can talk  about  B,  and  when  A  and  B  are  metaphorically  related,  the  subject  will make the connection 'spontaneously' and respond appropriately…the analogic, or  metaphoric,  approach  to  hypnosis  is  particularly  effective  with  resistant subjects, since it is difficult to resist a suggestion  one  does  not know consciously that he is receiving. (1973, pp. 26-7)\nIn Webster's Encyclopedia of Dictionaries, a metaphor is defined as 'a figure of speech which  makes  an  implied  comparison  between  things  which  are  not  literally  alike.' Metaphors  in  the  therapeutic  context  may  include  anecdotes,  jokes,  analogies,  or  any other form of indirect communication that conveys a meaningful message to the client on conscious and/or unconscious levels. Metaphors provide an opportunity for the client to learn from others' experiences, allowing him or her to identify, to some degree, with the characters, issues, and resolutions of the metaphor.\nLearning from the experience of others throughout recorded history has allowed human civilization  to  evolve.  You  do not  have to  experience something personally in order to know about it, and if you are reflective or thoughtful about others' experiences, you can understand  and  benefit  from  the  meanings  of  their  experiences  on  a  personal  level.  In growing up, you heard and read classic fairy tales like Snow White and Cinderella, and you learned something from them about human nature. Your parents' stories about their childhood taught you about families and growing up. In reading books of all kinds, you gradually learned about different societies, different lifestyles, as well as different types of relationships. Even in watching television and movies, your sense of involvement in\nthe  story  allows  you  to  experience  vicariously  similar  feelings  and  events  as  the characters  in  the  story,  broadening  your  range  of  experience  and  developing  resources that may be drawn upon at some future time.\nThe popular use of metaphorical approaches in clinical treatment is a relatively recent development, catalyzed primarily by the work of Milton Erickson. His fascinating and often  simple  teaching  stories  were  able  to  capture  his  patients'  interest  on  a  conscious level,  while  his  embedded suggestions allowed the patient's unconscious mind to form new associations that could serve him or her in therapeutic ways (Rosen, 1982; Yapko, 2001;  Zeig,  1980).  More  will  be  said  about  metaphorical  approaches  to  therapy  in  the next chapter, while this section focuses on the use of metaphor in the induction phase.\nYou may recall the earlier discussion about how a client's symptoms may be viewed as metaphors  of  his  or  her  experience.  Clinicians  have  historically  been  trained  to  take  a client's  communications  and  'read  between  the  lines'  to  uncover  their  'real'  meaning relative to the person's overall experience. Once the real meaning has been uncovered, the  clinician's  role  has  been  to  offer  interpretations  and,  through  the  interpretations, generate  insights  that  would  lead  to  new  perspectives  and,  ideally,  more  adaptive behavior in the client. In other words, while a client is communicating a meaning on a conscious  level,  it  is  understood  that  there  are  deeper  unconscious  meanings  being communicated simultaneously if one is perceptive enough to detect them. The multiplelevel communication on the part of the client has historically been responded to by the clinician in a clear, single-level interpretation.\nErickson considered such interpretations as too simplistic, too reductionistic, to reflect accurately the complexity of any piece of human experience. Furthermore, Erickson had great  faith  in  the  unconscious  mind's  resources,  and  thus  had  a  greater  interest  in techniques  that  could  make  use  of  them.  Erickson  also  thought  that  if  the  client  could communicate  on  multiple  levels,  why  couldn't  the  clinician  do  the  same?  Erickson's greater utilization of the unconscious in the treatment process was also out of respect for the integrity of those he worked with. If a person's unconscious mind defensively kept some  information  out  of  his  or  her  awareness  (i.e.,  repression),  was  it  necessary  and respectful to bring the information into the person's conscious mind? Erickson thought not, and believed that insights may even impede the therapeutic process by keeping the person  restricted  to  a  safe,  cognitive  level  of  existence,  widening  the  gap  between intellect and emotion rather than bridging it. Haley described Erickson's views on these issues this way:\nAlthough Erickson communicates with patients in metaphor, what most sharply distinguishes  him  from  other  therapists  is  his  unwillingness  to  'interpret'  to people  what  their  metaphors  mean.  He  does  not  translate  'unconscious' communication  into  conscious  form….  He  seems  to  feel  that  the  depth  and swiftness of that (therapeutic) change can be prevented if the person suffers a translation of the communication. (1973, pp. 28-9)\nAmong the safest of alternatives to working consciously with potentially reductionistic or even trite interpretations is the therapeutic metaphor. Relating a story that can capture the client's conscious interest while at deeper levels allowing him or her to learn new ways\nof thinking, feeling, and behaving is a respectful and flexible way of engaging the person in  the  treatment  process.  In  the  context  of  inducing  hypnosis,  metaphors  can  focus  the client's  attention  on  an  experience  that  is  interesting,  while  embedding  suggestions  for desired hypnotic responses into the story's framework.\nWhen  you  formulate  a  metaphor  for  the  purpose  of  induction,  it  helps  to  know something of the client's personal interests, values, and hobbies. Metaphors built around things  that  are  already  a  part  of  the  client's  lifestyle  are  more  likely  to  capture  and maintain the person's interest. Of course, things of an intrinsically fascinating nature will also serve well. The broader the base of knowledge and experience the clinician has, the more sophisticated one's metaphors can be. The metaphor as an induction method can introduce  the  client  to  other  clients'  experiences,  help  them  build  a  rapport  with  the clinician, build an identification with the character(s) of the story, confuse the client as to why the story is being told and thereby stimulate a search for meaning and relevance, all while building the internal  focus  and  receptivity  for  the  subsequent  intervention  (Zeig, 1980).\nPerhaps  the  easiest  metaphors  are  those  that  begin  with  'I  had  another  client  in  a similar situation to yours…' When you describe the experience of some previous client, the  client  can  come  to  identify  with  that  person,  and  also  build  confidence  in  the clinician's  experience  in  dealing  successfully  with  such  problems.  If,  for  example,  a client presented the complaints of excessive stress and a poor self-esteem, the induction might go something like this:\nYou're describing to me how uncomfortably tense you feel much of the time, and I guess it isn't often…or often enough…that you take the time to relax … and I'd like to tell  you  about  a  client  I  worked  with  not  long  ago…a  woman who is not  unlike  yourself …with many responsibilities…and she came  to  me feeling  so  tense…so  unsure  of  herself…uncertain  how  she  could  continue  to function on too little sleep with too much to do…and she didn't know that she didn't have to feel that way…and she wanted to feel good … feel relaxed …and when she sat  in  that  chair  you  just  happen  to  be  sitting  in,  too…she  actually took the time to notice how comfortable that chair is …and then she let herself take  in  some  deep  breaths …and  she  seemed  to just  let  go  of  the  everyday concerns …and she could listen to me comfortably …while her mind could begin to wander…and the memory of the last time she could relax deeply helped her realize  she  knew  how  to relax  so  deeply …and that she could and would take more time for herself…simply because she deserved it…and she learned how to re-evaluate her priorities…and she learned how to say no more comfortably to extra tasks she really didn't have time for…and she learned….\nThe above example is simply an induction starting point for leading into more metaphors about  possible  ways  to  start  to  build  confidence  and  better  manage  stress.  As  an induction, it begins by matching the client's concerns and then building the identification with another similar client who had a positive experience in some ways that may be of interest.  There  is  ample  room  to  maintain  rapport  by  incorporating  the  spontaneous responses of the client into the metaphor.\nTo illustrate a metaphorical induction tailored to a specific interest of the client's, the following  example  of  a  metaphor  was  developed  for  a  person  who  likes  to  watch television:\nYou  like  to  watch  television  when you  can  take  the  time  to  unwind …and watching  television  can  certainly  be  an  entertaining  way  to spend  some  time relaxing …and I like to watch TV sometimes…but not nearly as much as some people…there's someone I really think you should know about…who, like you, likes  to  watch  television  more  than  almost  any  other  form  of  entertainment… and as a good means of relaxing you and quieting your mind …and he says he can learn  a  lot  about  life  and  a  lot  about  people  by  watching  television…and there  was  a  show  on  once  that  he  told  me  about…that  he  watched  to  be entertained…that did much more than that…it taught him a lot about himself… he didn't know that in that show there was going to be an opportunity to have a pleasant learning experience …sometimes you discover important things in the most  unexpected  places…and  he  learned  something  important…ause  in  that show he watched, there was a man who…not unlike you…felt very badly about a problem he just couldn't seem to resolve.\nIn the above example, television as a learning device and a source of relaxation is used as a  vehicle  to  lead  the  client  into  hypnosis.  At  the  point  where  the  example  stops,  the clinician can go into one or more metaphors about the client's problem and its potential resolution.\nAlmost any experience can serve as a metaphorical induction into hypnosis when the qualities  of  that  experience  are  defined  as  absorbing,  comforting,  and  meaningful. Engaging the person's attention on the content of the story allows for deeper messages embedded  in  the  story's  structure  to  stimulate  the  client's  unconscious  associations. Metaphors,  because  of  their  indirect  style,  create  the  possibility  for  a  response,  but whether one is obtained is dependent on the way the metaphor is introduced (called the 'framing' of the metaphor), the appropriateness of the metaphor for that individual client, and  the  degree  of  rapport  maintained  throughout  its  telling.  The  metaphor  must  be introduced as potentially significant, either by some direct introductory remark such as, 'This other client of mine I'd like to tell you about is someone I think you could learn something valuable from…' or indirectly through the meaningful tone of your voice and quality of eye contact. The relevance of the metaphor was discussed earlier, and should involve something of interest to the client (unless you consciously choose to bore your client into hypnosis!). The rapport between you is maintained by incorporating feedback from the client spontaneously into the telling of the metaphor.\nStorytelling seems to have become an art on the decline. Television has saturated our society and placed us in the role of passive viewers of experience. Interactions between people become fewer in frequency as more of us learn to 'talk' to computers instead. Developing a skill in storytelling is fundamental to developing a balanced approach to the practice of clinical hypnosis. One way to do that is to reread the classic fairy tales, fables, and old mythology, for they are excellent starting points for rediscovering the wisdom of the ages that's been handed down in story form.\nThe specific dynamics of meaningful metaphor construction could fill volumes, and so can only be superficially presented in this book. For more in-depth consideration, see the work  of  Stephen  and  Carol  Lankton  (1983,  1989),  Philip  Barker  (1985),  D.Corydon Hammond (1990), and Peter Brown (1993), to name just a few of many good sources.",

        "text": "You may recall the discussion of negative suggestion structures, presented in Chapter 12. Negative suggestions, when used skillfully, can encourage positive responses in clients through  their  paradoxical  effect  (Grinder  &  Bandler,  1981).  They  can  do  so  in  part because of the transderivational search and ideodynamic processes, and in part because of their acceptance and utilization of client resistances. Resistance as a factor in the hypnotic interaction is discussed in greater detail later in chapter 21; suffice it to say here that few clients  are  blindly  obedient  to  the  suggestions  of  the  clinician.  Instead,  each  client maintains a sense of control, internal homeostasis, and autonomy through the rejection of input (evidence of 'resistance' according to the clinician's way of thinking) even when the input is obviously intended to benefit the client.\nIn  those  clients  where  control  is  a  sensitive  personal  issue,  a  tendency  to  respond negatively and in a contrary manner as a reliable response pattern is frequently evident. If the clinician says, 'It's day,' the client responding in an oppositional mode disagrees and says, 'It's night.' Such polar responsiveness is not necessarily aimed specifically at the clinician,  rather  may  be  a  general  response  pattern  that  the  person  uses  everywhere  or nearly everywhere to his or her own detriment. You have undoubtedly experienced such people's  ability  to  stir  up  conflict  wherever  they  go,  yet  who  often  puzzle  over  why people don't relate to them very well. The need to defend against others' input in order to maintain what must be a precarious internal balance is a basis for such response styles. Someone with a greater  sense  of  self  can  maintain  a  strong  sense  of  personal  identity even while selectively incorporating ideas from others.\nIn the hypnotic interaction, the negative response style can be accepted and utilized in the  service  of  hypnotic  induction  and  utilization.  The  principle  underlying  the  use  of negative suggestions is, 'fight fire with fire.' When negative suggestions are offered to the  critical,  controlling  client,  he  or  she  can  naturally  reject  them  and  respond  in  an opposite way. Knowing the client's tendency to respond in such a contrary manner, the clinician can deliberately use negative suggestions the client will reject in order to get the opposite  response(s)  that  is  actually  desired.  Beware,  though,  for  offering  negative suggestions  will  seem  an  obvious  and  demeaning  trick  unless  they  are  offered  in  a congruent and meaningful manner.\nImagine, for a moment, a client sitting opposite you who is anxious, uncertain about you and your hypnosis techniques, uncertain about him- or herself, and who is struggling to maintain a sense of personal control. The following example of an induction through negative suggestion might be a useful one to employ.\nYou've come here looking for help with your problem because you don't like the way you are feeling…and you can feel differently …but I don't expect you to know that  yet…for right  now…it's  important  to  know…you  can  and  perhaps\neven should reject anything and everything I say…you don't have to listen to me or anybody else… you have the right to ignore anything you want to…especially if it's different than what you already believe…you can't be expected to be open enough right away to listen and learn what you came here to…at least not yet… and for now you can't be expected to change in a meaningful way …until you've had the opportunity to continue feeling badly a while longer…so don't listen to me…and  don't give  yourself  the  chance  to  feel  more  at  ease …and  you  can continue to squirm in your chair… I don't want you to relax here or now… I don't  think  there's  any  reason  for  you  not  to  continue  fidgeting…so  don't  sit still and don't let your muscles relax…and don't let your eyes close even when they  can  get  so  tired  of  staying  open…and  some  people feel  good when  they know they don't have to listen to me…talking about all the ways you don't need to notice  opportunities  to  change in  a  comfortable  way…and  don't allow yourself  the  comfort  of  relaxing  deeply …because  you  might start to feel better …and it's much too soon for that to happen…\nIn the above example, suggestions for relaxing and changing were offered in the negative framework, 'don't do this.' To the client deemed negative and resistant, on the surface no demands have been made and so there really isn't anything to resist consciously. On an unconscious level, the ideodynamics associated with the transderivational search process assure  you  of  some  degree,  however  small,  of  responsiveness  to  your  suggestions  on which to build. You have to think of relaxing in order not to relax, you have to think of change in order to think of not changing, and so on. The key is to incorporate into the process whatever specific spontaneous responses arise in the person, redefining them as cooperative.  For  example,  if  you  accept  the  client's  fidgeting  instead  of  labeling  it  a resistant  behavior,  it  can  be  encouraged.  By  encouraging  it,  you  define  it  as  something useful  in  the  interaction,  even  though  the  client's  intention  was  to  not  cooperate.  This technique of using negative suggestions to utilize the client's resistance is one more way of  responding  to  resistance  in  addition  to  those  described  in  chapter  21  on  non-ideal responses from clients to your methods.\nThe  use  of  negative  suggestions  in  the  induction  phase  of  hypnotic  interaction  is intended to use a client's resistance to help guide him or her into hypnosis. At some point, the client realizes that all your suggestions about not relaxing, not letting go, not focusing internally,  and  so  on,  have  had  the  indirect  effect  of  facilitating  the  attainment  of hypnosis.  This  can  be,  and  usually  is,  a  positive  turning  point  in  the  relationship.  The client has now had his or her experience guided by the clinician, and not only did he or she survive it but actually found it pleasant and relaxing. The relief that comes from not having to fight to maintain a sense of control can have a profound impact on the client, who has now started to learn from his or her own direct experience that he or she can still be  in control  without  having  to  fight  others  off  negatively.  This  initial  hypnotic experience can then serve as a basis for future hypnotic experiences conducted in a more positive suggestive framework.",

        "text": "The process of  eliciting  hypnotic  experience  involves  creating  a  somewhat  dissociated condition in which the client's unconscious mind is able to function with a greater degree of  autonomy  than  in  the  usual  'waking'  state.  Confusion  techniques  are  especially effective for facilitating dissociation and, therefore, hypnosis (Erickson, 1964; Gilligan, 1987).  Confusion  techniques  are  among  the  most  complex  hypnotic  patterns  to  master because they are, well, confusing .\nHuman beings generally hate to be confused. Confusion creates an unpleasant internal state  that  motivates  the  person  to  clear  up  the  confusion.  Frequently,  the  person  is  so motivated to resolve the confusion he or she will jump to erroneous conclusions just to have a conclusion, any conclusion. Confusion techniques deliberately disrupt the client's everyday mental set in order to increase the likelihood of a suggestion getting in (Otani, 1989).  Because  people  do  not  like  to  be  confused  and  will  hold  erroneous,  even  selfdestructive, ideas rather than allow an issue to remain unsettled, the clinician faces the task  of  dislodging  old,  hurtful  thought  patterns  in  order  to  build  more  adaptive  ones. When you are certain about something, how likely are you to change your attitude about it? Not very likely, for the more certain you are about an idea or behavior, the more stable and thus resistant to change you are in that domain. When you aren't sure, though, you are much more likely to take in what others say and adopt their recommendations for as long as they seem credible to you.\nConfusion  deliberately  causes  uncertainty,  and  thus  paves  the  way  for  a  change  in attitude and behavior. When people are confused, they STOP! And then they develop an internal  focus  (a  spontaneous  hypnosis)  as  they  quickly  sort  through  everything  they know  in  order  to  resolve  the  confusion.  While  the  person's  conscious  mind  is  so preoccupied with making sense of something, the unconscious is more readily available for any suggestion that will reduce the dissonance. In a nutshell, that's the mechanism of confusion techniques. The relevant principles are listed in Table 6 below.\nConfusion techniques can take a variety of forms, but generally fall into one of two categories:  pattern  interruption  strategies  and  overload  techniques.  Pattern  interruption techniques involve saying and/or doing something to deliberately interrupt the person's routine response style in some area. One may strive to interrupt a person's experience of a  thought,  a  feeling,  or  behavior,  or  some  other  pattern,  depending  on  the  desired outcome.  Disrupting  the  pattern  and  shifting  the  person  onto  a  'new  track'  can effectively  break  the  old  pattern  long  enough  to  let  a  new  and  potentially  helpful experience have a meaningful impact.\nTable 6. Assumptions Regarding Confusion Techniques\nTable 7 . Pattern Interruption Strategies\nInterrupting  a  person's  pattern  may  be  accomplished  in  a  variety  of  ways  as  listed  in Table 7 above.\nChanging some of the environmental variables surrounding the pattern (e.g., where the person  'does'  the  symptom),  shifting  the  sequence  of  the  pattern's  subcomponents, altering others' responses to the pattern, exaggerating or emphasizing the implications of the pattern, surrounding the desired responses with confusing irrelevancies, and building new associations to the pattern through outrageous and/or incongruent clinician responses\nare just a few techniques available to interrupt client patterns. Furthermore, one can use gestures to interrupt a client, one can dramatize with nonverbals the client's position, and one can use language patterns that are so ambiguous or are even blatantly in violation of normal speech syntax that the client becomes entranced through trying to figure out how a clinician can behave in such an unpredictable, even odd, way.\nThe  following  is  a  transcript  of  Milton  Erickson  using  a  confusion  technique  on  a patient experiencing pain (in Haley, 1967; p. 152). Part of Erickson's strategy involved the use of language patterns violating the routine patterns of meaningful communication while  embedding  therapeutic  suggestions  at  a  deeper  level.  The  normal  flow  of consciousness  in  the  client  is  interrupted  in  order  to  accommodate  Erickson's  unusual speech patterns, allowing the client's unconscious to absorb meaningful suggestions in a beneficial way.\n(…some family member or friend)… knows pain and knows no pain and so do you wish to know no pain but  comfort and you do know comfort and no pain and as comfort increases you know that you cannot say no to ease and comfort but you can say no pain and know no pain but know comfort and ease ….\nWhile the client's conscious mind focuses on trying to make sense at a cognitive level out of a linguistic mess, at the feeling level the associations triggered by the suggestions to feel good and feel no pain allowed Erickson's patient the desired comfort.\nThe  above  transcript also demonstrates elements of the other form confusion techniques  may  take,  namely  overload  techniques.  Overload  as  a  means  for  creating confusion  can  take  the  forms  of  excessive  repetition  and  sensory  overload.  In  the transcript above, Erickson's repetition of the suggestions to feel comfort and feel no pain are  so  frequent  and  so  excessive  while  embedded  in  other  confusing  statements  that  it would  be  difficult  to  resist  each  and  every  one  on  a  suggestion  by  suggestion  basis. Repetition  of  suggestions  is  extremely  tiresome  (and  boring)  for  the  client's  conscious mind,  yet  repetition  is  a  well-known  enhancer  of  the  unconscious  mind's  learning process. Embedded in a confusion technique, however, are suggestions that are clear and actually make some sense. These can stand out as if illuminated in neon compared to the confusing background, and thus draw greater attention and potential impact.\nThe  other  form  of  overload,  sensory  overload,  involves  so  overloading  the  person's conscious mind with information coming in from multiple sources that it can't possibly keep up; as the conscious mind struggles to stay focused, the unconscious can respond to a greater degree. An example of a sensory overload technique is the 'Double Induction' technique originated by Kay Thompson and Robert Pearson (see Thompson's Frame of Reference  section  in  chapter  8),  and  described  by  Stephen  Gilligan  (1987).  With  two clinicians simultaneously doing  hypnotic  inductions  on  a  single  client,  the  client  may initially  attempt  to  follow  both  clinicians'  voices,  but  he  or  she  quickly  learns  that  it's simply  not possible to consciously  keep  up  with  both  for very long. Whatever information  is  offered  that  escapes  conscious  detection  and  analysis  might  still  be incorporated  on  an  unconscious  level,  and  for  the  beleaguered  and  overloaded  client, hypnosis may be a nice, relaxing place to escape to.\nSensory overload can involve the use of multiple (two or more) hypnotists working on\na single client, or multiple stimuli (sounds, smells, sights…) operating on different levels. If you do not have the luxury of another clinician around to try this technique, you can even  make  a  general  induction  tape  and  play  it  during  a  session  while  simultaneously doing your more personalized approach 'live.' You can even suggest to your client that, 'You  can  listen  to  me…or,  you  can  listen  to  me!'  Such  overload  techniques  can  be especially useful in the treatment of individuals in pain (Yapko, 1988).\nConfusion techniques for the purpose of induction require clear-headedness on the part of the clinician, demanding he or she know what he or she is doing at each moment. It also requires some dissociation on the part of the clinician (as well as the client) in order to  keep  from  getting  caught  up  in  the  confusion  he  or  she  is  creating!  One  can  build confusion  around  virtually  any  dimension  of  experience,  from  the  days  of  the  week ('You can relax on Tuesday but not nearly as well as on Wednesday and if you remember on Sunday how good it felt to relax on Friday you can remember one day on a Monday to take in a deep breath and…') to remembering ('How can one forget how good it feels to go deeply  into  hypnosis when one remembers that to forget what one remembers only reminds one to forget remembering the comfort and peace of remembering to forget what you've  forgotten  to  remember  about  forgetting  tension  and remembering  comfort …'). Table 8 below lists the specific dimensions of experience at which one can aim confusion strategies.\nBy offering confusing suggestions in a manner generally regarded as meaningful, the clinician  induces  the  client  to  search  and  find  meaning  at  deeper  levels.  Confusion techniques are especially good for clients deemed highly cognitive, especially those who tend to intellectualize their problems or feelings. The intellect cannot keep up for very long with an abundance of irrationalities embedded with meaning, and so overloads can shift the intellectual client onto a more affective level of relating.\nIn sum, confusion techniques are among the most complex and difficult techniques to use skillfully, but when they work, they work well. (I'm clear about that!)",

Along with recent trends in America of fundamentalist religious revival have come occasional accusations sent my way about 'doing the Devil's work' because of my use of hypnosis. If you have not personally experienced such fear and ignorance, consider yourself fortunate. It's hard to believe, but it's true that many people have an entirely irrational fear of hypnosis. How do  hypnosis  books  still  manage  to  work  their  way  onto  the  shelf  in  the  Occult  Books section  of  some  bookstores?  The  answer  to  that  question  lies  in  the  many  hypnotic phenomena that are, to the untrained observer, unusual at least and spooky at most.\nThe various so-called classic hypnotic phenomena that will be defined and described in this  chapter  are  the  basic  ingredients  for  the  therapeutic  applications  of  hypnosis. Furthermore,  they  are  the  basic  building  blocks  of all experience,  differing  from  their clinical applications only in degree, not kind (Spanos, 1991; Wagstaff, 1991). Shades of hypnotic phenomena are found in ongoing daily experience, but they are most dramatic to observe  (and  experience)  when  distilled  to  their  essence  as  in  structured  hypnotic processes. These hypnotic phenomena can be assembled in ways that may help or hurt, depending on their associated content. More will be said about this idea later, particularly in relation to hypnotic phenomena and symptom formation.\nThe  various  hypnotic  phenomena  represent  valuable  but  typically  underdeveloped capacities of human beings. Each person is capable of these hypnotic phenomena to one degree  or  another  in  the  formal  hypnotic  interaction  because  these  are,  in  a  sense, clinically structured amplifications of everyday experiences. In fact, these capacities are a necessary  part  of  our  experience  in  order  for  us  to  function  in  a  normal,  healthy  way (Bányai, 1991). To claim someone cannot be hypnotized is questionable, for if the person could not focus, remember, imagine, behave in automatic ways, and demonstrate other such hypnotic phenomena, he or she simply could not survive. Of course, people differ in these  abilities,  and  some  may  have  marginal  ability  at  best,  but  finding  someone  who can't do any of these at all would be pretty rare.\nWhen I  describe  the  various  hypnotic  phenomena,  I  will  also  describe  examples  of everyday contexts in which they naturally or spontaneously occur. People generally do not  think  of  these  random  experiences  as  related  to  hypnosis,  but  they  are  structurally identical. When they occur, people tend to dismiss them lightly with some variation of, 'Gee, that's kinda strange.' No further thought is given them, because they seem to 'just happen.' The average person senses no participation in or control over the experience. This is a primary reason for acquiring skills with hypnotic patterns: Rather than having such  potentially  useful  experiences  remain  random  and  seemingly  out  of  control,\nclinicians familiar with hypnosis can facilitate these experiences at  will for  meaningful reasons, instilling in clients a greater sense of control in their lives.\nThe recognition that hypnotic phenomena occur routinely in people is, in most ways, unique to the utilization approach. In other models of hypnosis, hypnotic phenomena are considered manifestations of the separate and distinct state called 'hypnosis.' Even when others have claimed hypnotic phenomena are concentrated forms of everyday occurrences, the techniques used to obtain such responses have incongruously only been ritualistic  and  artificial  (Gilligan,  1987;  Lankton  &  Lankton,  1983).  The  arbitrary  and content-filled structure of these techniques separates them from the utilization approach, which emphasizes a more natural and personally meaningful style for facilitating these responses.\nTable 9. Classical Hypnotic Phenomena*\nBoth  structured  and  naturalistic  inductions  have  been  presented  in  the  two  previous chapters, and consistent with my desire to acquaint you with the range of possibilities, both  structured  and  naturalistic  approaches  to  eliciting  hypnotic  phenomena  will  be presented  in  this  chapter.  Applications  of  these  phenomena  in  clinical  contexts  will  be discussed in later chapters.\nThe hypnotic interaction was described in chapter 14 as taking place in phases (i.e., attentional absorption, induction and deepening, therapeutic utilization, and disengagement).  This  and  later  chapters  will  focus  on  the  third  phase,  the  phase  of therapeutic utilization where hypnosis is used to facilitate some therapeutic intervention. Realistically, there is no clear dividing line between the different stages of hypnosis, and therapy may therefore take place at any point in the process. Usually, however, therapy is done in this utilization  phase  following  the  induction process.  The  more structured  the approach, the more the facilitation of hypnotic phenomena will be concentrated in this\nparticular stage.\nAs you read each of the following sections, you might think of your own experience of that  particular  hypnotic  phenomenon, specifically  what  happened  and what  the  context was. Discovering the everyday aspects of hypnotic experience can allow you to notice more of the spontaneous hypnotic responses arising in your clients as you interact with them,  broadening  your  capacity  for  therapeutic  utilization.  In  fact,  the  familiarity  with everyday  contexts  where  hypnotic  responses  occur  is  the  basis  for  the  naturalistic utilization  approaches  (Yapko,  2001  a;  Zeig,  1980).  The  general  approach  involves finding  and  describing  a  routine  situation  in  which  the  desired  response  is  likely  to naturally occur. The client can become absorbed in that suggested experience and may then naturally demonstrate the hypnotic phenomenon more easily with direct suggestions to  do  so  or  perhaps  even  without  the  clinician  directly  asking  for  it.  It  has  long  been known that simply imagining the occurrence of a movement can bring that movement about (Arnold, 1946). T.X.Barber, Nicholas Spanos, and John Chaves wrote in 1974 that hypnotic  responses  can  be  produced  by  imagining  'a  situation  which,  if  it  actually occurred, would tend to give rise to the behavior that was suggested' (p. 62). Similarly, emotions,  perceptions,  and  fantasies  can  be  suggested  that  will  give  rise  to  hypnotic phenomena.\nHere, then, are the classical hypnotic phenomena, presented in alphabetical order for easy reference.",

        "text": "Age regression is defined as an intensified absorption in and utilization of memory. Age regression techniques involve either guiding the client back in time to some experience in order to re-experience it (called 'revivification') as if it were happening in the here-andnow, or simply having the person remember the experience as vividly as possible (called 'hypermnesia'). In revivification, the client is immersed in the experience, reliving it in a close parallel to the way the memory was incorporated at the time it actually happened. In hypermnesia,  the  person  is  in  the  present  while  simultaneously  recalling  vividly  the details of the memory.\nMost  people  have  an  intuitive understanding of how  profoundly  our  previous experiences  affect  our  current  thoughts,  feelings,  and  behaviors.  Certainly,  psychology has  amassed  vast  amounts  of  information  to  substantiate  the  point.  Consequently,  age regression  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used  hypnotic  patterns  in  therapeutic  work.  Age regression as a clinical technique provides an opportunity to go back in time, whether it be  into  the  recent  or  distant  past,  in  order  to  recall  forgotten  memories  of  significant events that  can  serve  to  help  redefine  one's  view  of  oneself,  or  to  'work  through'  old memories in order to reach new and more adaptive conclusions. Memory is a process, not an  event. Memory  is  based  on  subjective  perception,  and  is  therefore  malleable  and dynamic. Memories can change in quality over time, as new experiences mingle with and affect older ones. Memories can be influenced intentionally or unintentionally because of\ntheir subjective and suggestible nature (Loftus & Hoffman, 1989; Sheehan, 1988, 1995).\nIn defining age regression as the intense absorption in and utilization of memory, the everyday aspects of age regression can become apparent, for people drift into memories routinely.  If  a  song  associated  with  a  high  school  sweetheart  comes  on  the  radio,  the listener can become absorbed in that person's memory and recall vividly things they did together and events taking place in their lives at that time. For a period of time, the rest of the  world  fades  from  awareness  while  the  person  is  deeply  internally  absorbed  and focused on memories, even re-experiencing profoundly the feelings from that time in his or her life.\nAge regression is as commonplace as that kind of experience. Any cue that triggers the person to go back in time to remember or relive some event is stimulating a 'spontaneous age regression.' Looking at photographs, hearing a certain song, seeing an old friend, and re-experiencing  a  feeling  not  felt  in  a  long  time  are  all  examples  of  routine  age regressions.\nAge regressions  can  be  structured  to  engage  someone  deliberately  in  some  memory that seems to have relevance to the symptoms the person is experiencing. People literally define  themselves  according  to  their  memories,  especially  those  memories  that  are  of highly charged significant emotional events. Many symptoms do, in fact, arise because of how people have interpreted the meaning of past events, and so exploring and addressing memories often becomes a critical part of treatment.",

        "text": "At this  point,  I  must  now  raise  the  issue  that  represents  what  has  been  a  most  bitterly emotionally  charged  and  divisive  issue,  not  only  in  the  field  of  hypnosis,  but  in  the mental  health  profession  as  a  whole.  It  has  been  known  as  the  'repressed  memory controversy,'  the  'false  memory  debate,'  the  'memory  wars,'  and  by  a  variety  of  far more inflammatory names. Unless you were in blissful oblivion somewhere during the latter  half  of  the  '90s,  you  were  reading  almost  daily  about  high-profile  trials,  reading articles  by  experts  vigorously  arguing  opposite  positions,  hearing  experts  on  television vehemently  arguing  mutually  exclusive  'realities,'  all  revolving  around  the  issue  of whether  presumably  repressed  memories  uncovered  through  therapy  in  general  and hypnosis  (i.e.,  age  regression)  in  particular  should  be  considered  valid  (Loftus,  1993; Terr, 1994; Yapko, 1993, 1994a).\nThere are many therapists who have been trained (either academically or self-taught) and who have come to believe that virtually all symptoms are necessarily a product of past experiences and even past traumas, almost invariably childhood sexual abuse, that need  to  be  identified  and  'worked  through.'  Thus,  if  someone  is  unable  to  recall  a memory  that  would  account  for  the  type  and  severity  of  someone's  symptoms,  the assumption is that the memory has been repressed, that is, split off from consciousness as a psychological defense. It is further assumed that excavating the memory is necessary for  recovery  (Blume,  1990;  Fredrickson,  1992).  In  searching  for  presumably  repressed memories, the critically important questions are these: Are traumatic memories 'locked away' and does finding the 'key' (with hypnosis or other memory recovery techniques)\nopen them up for accurate recall? Or, are the techniques used for locating and retrieving memories themselves capable of contaminating or distorting memories without either the clinician or client realizing it? To go a step further, can a well-meaning clinician and an unwitting  client  even create complex  and  emotionally  charged  memories  that  seem genuine yet are entirely fabricated (called confabulations)?\nThe  answers  to  these questions are now  reasonably  well  established, and  the controversy  has  all  but  died  away.  The  answer  to  the  first  question  is  yes,  traumatic memories can be locked away only to emerge much later (Spiegel, 1993). This appears to be an uncommon  phenomenon.  However,  what  can  only  be  addressed-but  not necessarily answered-is  the  question  of  the accuracy  of such  memories.  These memories  can  be  entirely  accurate,  partly  accurate,  partly  inaccurate,  and  entirely inaccurate.  Without  objective  evidence  to  corroborate  a  memory,  there  is  no  known technology for determining its veracity. Hypnosis does not reveal the truth. (More detail in the narrative or a more emotional telling of the episode does not mean it is any more likely to be true.) Neither does so-called truth serum or a lie-detector test, which is why information obtained through these tools of inquiry is not generally allowed in our courts. Since a true recovered memory cannot be reliably distinguished from a confabulation, it becomes even more critical for a clinician to minimize his or her potential contamination of a memory through unwitting suggestion.\nThe  second  and  third  questions  above,  regarding  the  memory  recovery  techniques themselves distorting or even creating memories, can both be answered with a firm yes. Memories have been shown to be highly responsive to a variety of suggestive influences in and out  of  hypnosis  (Labelle,  Laurence,  Nadon  &  Perry,  1990;  Lynn,  2001;  Lynn, Weekes, & Milano, 1989; McConkey, 1992; Orne, Whitehouse, Dinges, & Orne, 1996; Ready, Bothwell, & Brigham, 1997; Scheflin & Frischholz, 1999).",

        "text": "As bizarre as the following question seems, please take the time to read further and give serious consideration to the subject discussed. During a hypnosis session, have you ever had a client that believes that he/she has had an alien (extraterrestrial) abduction or encounter? Has this person experienced missing time or repetitive dreams about unusual  night  visitors?  In  the  last  four  years  there  has  been  a  65%\nincrease  in  reported  abduction  cases.  Many  of  these  reports  have surfaced during hypnosis sessions.\nWhat would you do if information similar to this was revealed by one of your clients during a hypnotic session? How do you help this person?… Some of the people have had conscious recall of the event. However,  the  majority  of  them  recalled  the  encounter  while  under hypnosis-which  many  had  sought  out  to  help  them  with  other problems…'\nWhat is your reaction to this letter? Do you believe people are genuinely being abducted by extraterrestrials, or is there something else going on here?\nLet's look at the serious implications of this letter, especially as they relate to the  practice  of  psychotherapy.  One  fact  the  letter  doesn't  mention  is  that  a popular  book  called Communion:  A  True  Story by  Whitley  Strieber  (1995) came out and received substantial media attention. The book is an intelligent and articulate description of the author's belief he has had repeated experiences of being abducted by extraterrestrials. Prior to becoming aware of the abductions, all Strieber had were periods of time he was amnesic for, and unusual dreams of abduction in which he served as a human guinea pig for extraterrestrials' experiments. Not long after, Harvard psychiatrist and Pulitzer Prize winner John Mack wrote a book called Abduction: Human Encounters With Aliens (1997), describing his work with patients who uncovered lots of details  of  their  extraterrestrial  abductions  which  they  revealed  with  great emotional intensity with his 'help.' A psychiatrist from Harvard, a title with considerable prestige and credibility, he seemingly believes in these accounts and sees no undue influence on his part in bringing such apparently repressed memories to the surface. Is it a coincidence that there is a '65% increase in reported  abduction  cases'  following  the  release  of  these  books  and  the associated media 'buzz' around them? I think not.\nIf so many people can be convinced so easily of 'trance channelers' (people who claim to go into a trance and become the medium through which other entities,  perhaps  as  old  as  35,000  years  according  to  one,  can  share  their 'wisdom') and people who can communicate with the dead, thanks to their popular books and even their own television shows, then you can convince a percentage  of  the  population  of anything . Hypnotic  past-life  regression, hypnotic  ESP,  hypnotic  aura-reading,  and  countless  other  'applications'  of hypnosis are offered to those who are either open to or already have beliefs in such phenomena.\nSo what's the problem? The serious problem is that a seemingly benevolent clinician  can  suggest  an  experience  that  the  individual  accepts  as  literally 'true.'  With  extraterrestrial  abductions,  it  is  easy  to  dismiss  the  problem lightly. However, consider what happens if what is suggested instead is that,\n'You have symptoms that suggest to me you may have been molested as a child. Let's do hypnosis to find out.'\nI am  aware  of  clinicians  too  numerous  to  count  who  have  become 'molestation specialists,' 'traumatists,' 'certified regression specialists,' and adopted other similar titles, who have a rudimentary checklist of 'signs of an abuse survivor.' These include poor self-esteem, sexual avoidance or apathy, relationship  difficulties,  unresolved  anger  toward  one  or  both  parents,  and other such symptoms. Don't these same 'signs' show up in almost everyone? But, a clinician intent on finding molestation issues to resolve can unwittingly plant  the  suggestion  in  the  client's  mind  of  the  possibility  of  such  an experience in her background. (e.g., 'Were you sexually abused as a child? No? Well, the fact that you can't remember it is\nnormal,  it's  called  repression').  Then,  in  hypnosis,  the  clinician  can  ask leading questions: 'Are you alone with your (father, uncle, family friend…)? Is he touching you? Why is he touching you? Where is he touching you? Is it a touch, or does it feel creepy like a fondle? It's okay, you're safe now and you can remember…' The client can then 'discover repressed memories' that can become the basis for a whole new identity-that of a molest victim. But, the memories may have no basis in reality.\nWhat made this issue so deeply controversial and emotionally charged was a natural and sincere desire to hear abused people tell their devastating stories when for so long they had been suffering silently or else were disbelieved and marginalized. The momentum for therapists was in the direction of believing all such stories, regardless of the conditions leading up to their emergence. As cooler-headed  researchers  and  clinicians  made  their  respective  points,  it became  clear  that  hearing  and  supporting  traumatized  people  remains  a critically  important  agenda for the mental health profession, but at the same time  clinicians  would  have  to  take  the  responsibility  to  learn  and  put  into practice the lesson that they were catalysts for the quality of the memories that came up in their clients. Clinicians would have to acknowledge and implement the principle that they are part of the process, not just outside observers of the process. (You learned this same principle about doing hypnosis, namely that your client's responses are not separate and distinct from the things you say and  do.)  The  use  of  direct  suggestions,  or  even  just  leading  questions, amplified  in  age  regression,  can  create  a  false  memory  that  can  become  a pathological frame of reference for the client that may last a lifetime. But be reminded, formal hypnosis is not necessary for this to occur.\nJust to clarify and reinforce the key point of this section: This controversy revolved  around suggested  memories of  abuse  given  to  the  client by  the clinician when  the  client  had  symptoms  but  no  recollection  of  any  such trauma. If someone knows now and has always known he or she was abused, then  the  issue  is  moot:  Such  memories  can  be  believed  and  considered  as\nreliable as any others.\nTo say this sensitive issue is complicated is a gross understatement. For the reader who wants to study this issue in greater depth, there are many excellent sources  to  refer  to.  These  include  the  works  of  Baker  (1992);  Brown, Scheflin,  and  Hammond  (1998);  Ceci  and  Bruck  (1995);  Doris  (1991); Gardner  (1992);  Loftus  and  Ketcham  (1994);  Lynn  and  McConkey  (1998); McConkey and Sheehan (1995); Ofshe and Watters (1994); Schachter (1996); Spanos (1996); Terr (1994); van der Kolk (1994); and Yapko (1994b); all of which are listed in this chapter's reference section.",

        "text": "In using age regression clinically, at least two general strategies can be employed, each giving rise to a variety of specific techniques. The first general strategy concerns the use of  age  regression  to  go  back  to  negative,  or  even  traumatic  kinds  of  experiences.  The intention is to allow  the client to explore the event(s), release pent-up  feelings ('catharsis')  while  simultaneously  providing  new  ways  of  looking  at  that  situation ('reframing') that may help him or her release or redefine whatever negative influences from  that  experience  may  still  be  affecting  his  or  her  life.  In  this  strategy,  either revivification or hypermnesia may be employed, depending on the clinician's judgment as to how immersed in or distant from the experience the client can be in order to receive maximum benefit. For example, if a client felt rejected by his or her mother, and feels worthless  as  a  result,  the  clinician  may  want  to  take  the  client  back  in  time  through revivification to relive one or more of the interactions critical in developing that feeling. This  could  be  done  by  helping  him  or  her  to  relive  the  feelings  and  re-experience  the sights and sounds of that event while supporting him or her in expressing those feelings. Then, the clinician can focus him or her on dimensions of that experience previously not consciously attended to by him or her. By adding new understandings and insights to the old  memory, one can help the client to re-shape the memory. Maybe the client can be encouraged to feel loved and cared for by a mother who was, perhaps, guilty of nothing more than expressing her affection in a distant way (or not at all) because of her own emotional limitations, rather than because of the daughter's presumed lack of worthiness.\nReaching  a  new  conclusion  about  an  old  experience  can  change  your  feeling  about yourself quite dramatically. Having the client immersed in the experience allows for its powerful emotional impact. In contrast, if one were working with a woman who had the terrible  experience  of  being  raped,  putting  her  back  in  that  intense  situation  through revivification is generally an undesirable alternative. She may be better helped through the  more  psychologically  distant  technique  of  hypermnesia.  In  this  approach,  she  can safely be  in  the  here-and-now  while  working  through  the  trauma  of  the  past  (Smith, 1993).\nThe second general strategy of age regression is one of accessing and amplifying client resources,  and  is  compatible  with  and  easily  integrated  with  the  first.  The  strategy involves identifying and making use of specific problem-solving abilities the client has demonstrated in past situations but is not currently using, unfortunately to his or her own\ndetriment. Often, the client has positive abilities he or she doesn't recognize, and because he  or  she  doesn't  have  an  awareness  for  them  and  a  means  to  access  them,  they  lie dormant. In using age regression, the clinician can help the client redis-cover in his or her own past personal experience the very abilities that will allow him or her to manage the current situation in a more adaptive way. For example, if someone were complaining of difficulty in learning something new, the clinician might guide the person back in time to a variety of past experiences of initially feeling frustrated in learning something, and then showing how each frustration eventually led to mastery of that information and greater self-confidence in that area. Learning to get dressed, to read and write, to drive a car, and countless other experiences all started out being intimidating new experiences and later became  routine,  automatic  abilities.  Immersing  the  client  in  the  experience  of  the satisfaction of mastering learnings that once seemed difficult can help him or her build a more positive attitude (i.e., frustration tolerance) toward the present challenges.",

        "text": "Any pattern of suggestion that helps the client subjectively experience going back in time is  an  approach  to  age  regression.  One  general  approach  to  age  regression  employs suggestions that involve the use of structured and imaginative imageries as the trigger to recapture past experiences. Other approaches involve more  naturalistic, everyday approaches to immersion in memory. Either approach can be a good one, depending on the client's response style.\nPatterns that make use of the client's imagination include the various 'special vehicle' approaches (e.g., train, plane, time machine, space ship, elevator, and the like) that can transport  the  client  back  in  time  to  the  event  under  consideration.  The  special  vehicle imagery  is an artificial, concrete, and  content-oriented means  for  structuring the experience,  and  thus  requires  a  considerable  amount  of  detail  in  order  to  facilitate  the regressive  process  for  the  client.  The  following  is  an  example  of  an  age  regression approach (initiated after induction and deepening) using a 'special train':\n…and now that you can experience yourself as comfortably relaxed…you can let  yourself  have  the  experience  in  your  mind…of  going  to  a  special  train station…a train station unlike any you've ever experienced before…where the trains that run are so unusual in their ability to take you back in time…and you can go back in time…to important experiences you haven't thought about in a long, long time…and you can walk over to one and see yourself getting onto the most interesting-looking train…and you can easily find your way to a seat that is so comfortable to sit in…so soft you can rest there…deeply resting…and then as  you  feel  the  train  begin  to  move  in  a  gentle  and  pleasant  way…you  can experience  the  distinct  movement  of  the  train's  motion…going  backward  in time…slowly  at  first…then  faster…building  a  powerful  momentum…and  as you look out the window…and see the events of your life moving past you like so many telephone poles you pass on the way, the memories of yesterday…then the  day  before…and  the  day  before…and  the  day  before…and  all  the  days before…can  drift  through  your  mind  as  you  go  further  and  further  into  the\npast…when  way  back  then  becomes  now…and  then  the  train  begins  to  slow down…and then it comes to a stop…and now you can step off the train to find yourself  in  that  situation  that  was  so  important  to  you…and  being  in  that situation now, you can see the sights, hear the sounds, and feel the feelings of that time and place… this time and place….\nAt this point, dialogue between the clinician and client may be initiated, in order to elicit the details of the memory he or she is re-experiencing. Asking the client where in time he or she is, who else is present in the memory, what exactly is occurring, what he or she is thinking, feeling, or doing, as well as any other relevant questions can lead the clinician to better understand how the experience was incorporated by the client as a memory so that a  differing  perspective,  one  that  may  be  more  adaptive,  may  be  offered  as  part  of  the therapy.\nIf the client knows when a certain significant event occurred, the clinician can regress the client back to that specific time. Often, though, the client has no idea when a certain feeling,  thought,  or  behavior  started.  In  such  instances,  the  clinician  can  offer  some process-oriented  suggestions,  such  as  in  the  special  train  example  above  in  which  no particular  age  or  context  for  the  regression  were  specified.  In  that  example,  it  was  left entirely to the client to choose an experience to focus on as representative of his or her presenting problem's evolution. The clinician must ask the client to verbalize the details of his or her experience at some point so he or she can assist the client in having access to as  much  of  the  memory  as  possible  and  in  order  to  determine  where  and  when  to intervene.\nWhatever  approach  you  choose  to  employ  as  the  catalyst  for  the  age  regression experience, the use of more details to associate to encourages a greater involvement in the experience.  To  accomplish  a  more  personally  distant  experience  of  the  past  event, suggestions can be provided that the client is present (dissociated) in the secure here-andnow, and it can be 'as if you are watching a movie of an experience…and as you watch comfortably…you can learn something important from yourself over there…'\nMore naturalistic approaches to age regression involve offering indirect suggestions to become engaged in memory without the formality of saying, 'Now you can go back in the  past.'  Patterns  include  asking  accessing  questions to  orient the  person  to  his  or  her own past personal history, and conversationally sharing learnings from past personal or professional  experiences.  Asking  questions  to  orient  the  person  to  his  or  her  own  past experiences as an approach involves the client in a search through his or her past in order to  recall  the  appropriate  events  necessary  to  respond  meaning-fully.  Such  a  search  can start out as a more distant memory simply being cognitively remembered, but then skillful further questioning can begin to immerse the client in the memory in order to actually reexperience it. The following is an example of such a pattern:\nClinician: Can you remember your fourth-grade teacher? (Orienting the client to age nine or ten)\nClient: Sure, it was Miss Smith. As I recall, she was a really nice teacher. (Starting to remember that teacher and some associated childhood experiences)\nClinician: Fourth grade can certainly be an interesting time in one's life…many changes\ncan take place in a person's thinking… I wonder if you can remember which event of that time in your life was especially important to you?…\nClient: Well…there was a time once when I got into trouble at school and my mother… (Relates the story's details)\nClinician: Can you… see yourself clearly in that experience? …as you see yourself in that experience, you can remember how you felt, can't you…and those feelings are feelings that are still a part of you…even though you haven't thought about them in a long while…and you can see the other people and how they look… how they are dressed… and you can hear what they say that is so important to you…and what do they say?…\nAs the clinician asks the client to fill in the details of the memory, the client naturally becomes more and more immersed in it to the point of starting to re-experience it (notice the changing of tenses from past to present). This type of regression is a routine part of many  psychotherapies,  particularly  those  that  focus  on  the  past  as  a  means  of  better understanding  and  altering  the  present.  Such  gradual  immersion  in  the  memory  is  a smooth and natural approach for focusing on the past. The involvement becomes greater and  greater  as  the  clinician  involves  more  and  more  of  the  person  in  all  the  sensory components of the memory to as great a degree as possible.\nIn order to make the experience of going back into the past less personally threatening, the clinician can indirectly facilitate regression by describing his or her own relevant past learnings,  or  the  relevant  past  learnings  of  others.  When  the  experience  of  others  is described,  the  client  naturally  tends  to  project  him-  or  herself  into  that  situation, imagining how he or she would feel or act in that situation. Talking about the experiences of others as children, for example, can build an identification for the client on the basis of his  or  her  own  experiences  as  a  child.  Thus,  the  regression  occurs  indirectly  through identification and projection, and the client can go back in time to recall or re-experience the  relevant  memories.  The  following  is  an example  of  such  an approach,  offered  to  a client who felt guilty unnecessarily and unjustly about her parents having divorced when she was only six years old. The regression involves taking the client back to that time in order to re-experience the irrational feeling she that she was somehow responsible for her parents' divorce. This metaphorical example stops before the point of making the hurtful decision, and does not go into the actual re-decision therapy for such a problem.\nClinician: Children are quite remarkable, don't you think?\nClient: Yes, I do.\nClinician: Sometimes kids think the whole world revolves around them…like life is a universal game of 'peek-a-boo'…that the whole world stops for a while…and goes away to someplace else…who knows where…maybe someplace really calming and beautiful…when the child closes her eyes and the world disappears…how well can you remember being a child…and closing your eyes…and wondering where everyone went?…\nClient: I used to play hide-and-seek a lot as a child, and I can remember worrying I'd never find them again…but, of course, that's just a child's silly fears.\nsometimes I'd be all alone, that when I closed my eyes everyone would be gone and Clinician: That's interesting, because a child I'm working with described that same\nfeeling…she's almost seven years old now, and she's feeling very proud of being in the first grade…excited and thrilled…the way almost all kids once were…you can remember that, can't you?…about being in school and learning to learn about how much there is to learn…and that there is a huge and complex world out there…a world much bigger than the world of a six-year-old…but the six-year-old doesn't know that yet…she still has to learn to read and write…about science and math…about adults and other kids…about falling in and out of love…and the six-year-old's world is always changing and growing…but not so fast as she thinks…because part of her still thinks the world revolves around her…and that she can cause big things to happen… and she won't learn until she's older…that the world doesn't revolve around her at all…that she's just six…and, understandably, afraid of being alone…\nIn the above example, the clinician is matching the part of the client that is feeling overly responsible at age six with the thoughts and feelings of a six-year-old. When these are described in a way that can allow the client to recapture her similar thoughts and feelings, she can age regress in a more spontaneous and naturalistic way. Furthermore, the seeds for the subsequent therapy are being planted simultaneously when the therapist points out in  a  nonthreatening  way  the  distorted  perceptions  of  a  six-year-old.  This  can  pave  the way for the client to accept that her thoughts at that time might have been distorted also, and may therefore be more easily transformed.\nOther techniques for age regression include: (1) Affect or somatic bridging, where the client's current feeling or awareness is linked ('bridged') to the first time, or one of the first times, he or she had that same feeling or awareness ('…and as you continue to be aware of that 'abandoned feeling' you've described, you can drift back in time and recall the  first  time  you  ever  had  that  same  feeling');  (2)  Temporal  disorientation,  in  which confusional suggestions are employed to disorient the client from 'now' and reorient the person to 'then' ('What happens now and then is that remembering then now reminds you  now  of  then  when  then  is  so  important  and  when  then  becomes  now  because yesterday led to today and you can remember yesterday as if it were now because now and  then  remembering  then  as  if  it  were  now  can  be  so  important…');  and,  (3)  Age progression and regression, in which the client is first guided into the future at which time he or she can remember the things that have happened in his or her past ('Look forward to the times that you can look back…'). By orienting to the future first, an even greater emotional distance is created from past experiences, making them easier to recapture and use therapeutically.\nAge regression is one of the most widely used and beneficial applications of clinical hypnosis.  The  clarity  of  long  forgotten  memories  that  can  be  elicited  or  the  power  of constant, intrusive memories that can be restructured are common components of clinical work  in  general  and  the  use  of  hypnosis  in  particular.  Knowing  the  mechanisms  of memory, including its\nTable 10. Age Regression Strategies\nstrengths  and  limitations,  is  vital  to  sound  clinical  practice.  If  you  haven't  yet  made  a study of memory, I'd encourage you to do so before your next client walks in and says some variation of, 'When I was ten, here's what happened to me…'",

        "text": "In  contrast  to  age  regression's  utilization  of  memory,  age  progression  involves  a utilization  of  projections  of  the  future. Age  progression  involves  guiding  the  client subjectively into the future,  where  he  or she  may have  the  opportunity to imagine and experience  the  consequences  of  current  or  new  choices,  integrate  meanings  at  deeper levels, rehearse new patterns of thought, feeling or behavior, and, in general, obtain more of  an  overview  of  his  or  her  life  than  a  narrower  focus  on  day-to-day  living  typically affords. You can think of it as encouraging hindsight while it is still foresight.\nProjecting on the basis of current trends what is likely to develop in the future is not just a pastime for futurists. Foresight is a vital skill to possess, and is quite probably the best tool of prevention that therapists could be teaching their clients, if only more of them would be far-sighted enough to do so. People have a part of them that can plan and allow for the possibilities of future experience. It is a resource that, with practice, can become more skilled and efficient. But, even in basic form, people have a sense of how today relates  to  tomorrow.  Common remarks like, 'See you there next week,' 'I'll read that tomorrow and get it back to you by next week,' 'I'd like to enroll in that new program next year,' and 'When I retire I'd like to spend my time traveling,' are all statements of intent  regarding  future  experience.  In  order  to  make  such  statements  realistically,  the person must project some portion of him- or herself into that experience and imagine in some detail what it would or will be like. Any suggestive communication strategy that orients the client experientially to future events is an age progression pattern.\nThere are differing theoretical views on the dynamics of future orientation. Some hold\nthe view that a client's future projections are purely fantasy material that have little or no relationship to the actual life experiences that will unfold over time. Such projections are considered  useful  in  the  same  way  as  Rorschach  inkblot  responses  might  be-as interesting reflectors of unconscious dynamics only, with little true bearing on the future. Others hold the view that the unconscious has within it a 'pre-programmed destiny' (acquired early in life through socialization according to believers with a sociallearning  orientation, acquired  genetically  according  to  believers  with  a  biological orientation, or acquired through the evolving soul for those with a spiritual or philosophical orientation). The destiny of the person is thought to become available to the person through hypnotic patterns of age progression, when the 'all-knowing' unconscious is tapped by the clinician.\nMy perspective is that age progression is an extrapolation of personal trends, including one's motivations, feelings, behaviors, and interactional patterns. The client in hypnosis can  examine  and  extrapolate  relevant  trends  and,  depending  on  his  or  her  degree  of insight into them, can anticipate eventual outcomes. Many personal patterns, conscious or otherwise,  are  quite  predictable.  You  don't  have  to  be  a  psychic  to  predict  someone's reactions or behaviors accurately when you know something about how they tend to see things. That applies to predicting yourself as well. But, age progression is more than just predicting.  It's  about  becoming absorbed  in  the  future  as  if  it's  now, giving  rise  to understandings and emotions not easily accessible in other ways.",

        "text": "Age progression can be used in at least two general, complementary ways. One is as a therapeutic  intervention,  and  the  other  is  as  a  check  on  one's  clinical  work.  Both applications involve guiding the client into a future orientation, but for different purposes.\nAge  progression  for  therapeutic  purposes  can  be  structured  in  many  ways.  Most clinicians are well aware of the 'self-fulfilling prophecy,' the unconscious alignment of behavior with an expectation. One way to think about age progression is as the deliberate creation  of  a  therapeutic  self-fulfilling  prophecy,  that  is,  an  expectation  of  change  that can  be  the  foundation  for  the  client  adopting  new  adaptive  behaviors.  Irving  Kirsch's view  of  hypnosis  as  a  'non-deceptive  placebo'  is  a  parallel  construct  highlighting  the vital role of expectancy in hypnosis and psychotherapy (1993, 2000). Most important of all in age progression is the ability to experience some of the benefits of implementing the changes encouraged in the client through the therapy. To 'jump ahead' and preview and even feel the positive consequences of making important changes helps motivate the client to go ahead and actually do so. It takes the changes out of the realm of theory and gives them some life, some substance in the mind of the client. Other therapies (such as cognitive  therapy's  use  of  a  'success  imagery'  strategy  in  which  the  client  mentally rehearses the desired behavior leading to successful results) also recognize the value of lifting  the  client  out  of  the  moment  and  orienting  him  or  her  to  future  benefits,  but hypnosis can make this process more intense and multidimensional (Torem, 1992).\nUtilizing an age progression for the purpose of checking on one's work is one way of assessing two very important dimensions of therapeutic inter-vention. Specifically, one can assess whether the intervention's results will likely be lasting ones, and what impact\non the client's life system the intervention will ultimately have. Even though the change under  consideration  may  seem  an  obviously  beneficial  one,  there  may  be  less  obvious factors (personal, situational, or interpersonal) that can work to keep the client from fully succeeding in his or her endeavors. Age progression allows the client to project into the future  how  he  or  she  looks  and  feels  after  the  change,  how  he  or  she  looks  and  feels handling old situations in new ways, how others will likely react to his or her change, what areas might continue to be difficult for him or her, and, in general, which areas of his or her life have been affected positively and which negatively Such information can be  invaluable  to  the  clinician  in  formulating  the  intervention  while  simultaneously checking on the impact of his or her work.\nIf a client experiences age progression and still has the presenting complaint well into the future, clearly the therapy isn't over. For example, if after working with a client who wants to stop smoking the clinician senses he or she has guided the client into accepting that  he  or  she  no  longer  needs  or  wants  to  smoke,  and  then  the  clinician  does  an  age progression technique and the client still experiences him- or herself a month (a day, a week,  whatever)  into  the  future  as  a  smoker,  then  the  therapy  cannot  have  been successful. Questioning the age-progressed client about various dimensions of his or her 'recent' experience (post-therapy) can help the clinician discover what factors might play a  role  in  the  client  restarting  or  continuing  to  smoke  that  had  not  been  adequately addressed  in  the  intervention.  If  the  age-progressed  client  claims  he  or  she  wasn't smoking after therapy until he or she got into an argument with her boss, the clinician now knows he or she must provide some tools for effectively managing such a situation without  smoking.  Thus,  age  progression  can  serve  result-checking  as  well  as  strategy planning purposes.\nMilton  Erickson  had  a  little  sneakier,  albeit  sophisticated,  use  for  age  progression which  he  called  a  'pseudo-orientation  in  time'  (Erickson,  1954,  1980).  By  having  his patient go forward in time and relate to that time as the present, Erickson could ask his patient how he or she got over the problem-specifically what Erickson said or did for the patient-or what the patient learned or decided that helped him or her overcome his or  her  problem.  When  the  patient  gave  him  the  details  of  the  'past'  therapy  that  had helped him or her, Erickson facilitated amnesia for having done so, and thereby obtained his therapeutic strategy directly from the patient him- or herself!\nPosthypnotic suggestion necessarily involves age progression, and sometimes amnesia as well. A suggestion is given for the client to respond in a particular way in some future context, and in order for the client to accept such a suggestion, the client must experience some  degree  of  future  orientation.  In  fact,  orienting  the  client  to  positive  future possibilities  is  a  necessary  part  of any psychotherapy.  Even  therapeutic  approaches emphasizing  insights  into  the  past  can  encourage  some  future  orientation  when  such insights are expected to generate new possibilities in the client's future.",

        "text": "Patterns for facilitating age progression can range from structured, direct approaches to less direct and more conversational communications such as presuppositions. The direct approaches for facilitating age progression closely parallel the direct approaches\ndescribed for age regression. These might include a 'special vehicle' to take you into the future, a movie screen on which to watch or even step into a movie of the future, a book in which to read about your future and how it happened, or the imagery of a photograph collection  of  future  events  to  view  are  all  structured  approaches  to  facilitate  a  future orientation  or  projection.  As  you  can  tell,  the  approaches  to  hypnosis  are  as  varied  as your imagination allows.\nA simple, direct, permissive suggestion approach to age progression is exemplified in the following paragraph:\n…and  now  that  you've  had  the  opportunity  to  discover  something  very important about yourself, I wonder how many ways you'll find to use this new ability of yours creatively in your own behalf…and it can be as if a long time has passed since this session…a few days…and time passes so quickly…then a few  weeks…and  a  few  months  ago  we  spent  some  time  together  where  you learned that  you  could  feel  so  good…and  you  had  a  thought  at  that  time  that allowed you to look at yourself differently then…and feel differently now…and as  you  look  back  over  all  the  time  that  has  passed  since  then,  how  has  that thought affected you?… How are you different?… What can you do now that you couldn't do back then?…\nIn the above example, the client is encouraged to integrate some new thought or learning into his or her life in a way that will prove beneficial. Suggesting directly to the client that it is 'as if a long time has passed' orients him or her to the future as if it were now, a time to reflect on the recent change and its consequences. Questions such as those in the above example require increasing involvement in the 'then is now' experience, and can provide  concrete  ideas  to  the  clinician  about  other  factors  to  include  in  the  overall intervention.\nIndirect  suggestions  for  future  orientation  may  include:  (1)  metaphorical  approaches (e.g., 'I'd like to tell you about a client I worked with who could clearly imagine herself two months after our session doing exactly what we're talking about now and when she saw herself that way she discovered…'); (2) embedded commands (e.g., 'I sometimes like to look around and wonder what will happen in the future when you can look back at and  feel  good  about  all  the  changes you  have  made…');  (3)  presuppositions  (e.g.,  'I wonder exactly where you will be and what you'll be doing when you happily realize you haven't  smoked  in  days…');  and,  (4)  indirect  embedded  questions  ('You  can  tell  me about  how  you  will describe  the  way  you  solved  this  problem to  your  friends,  can't you?'). Each of these approaches and examples demonstrates a capacity for guiding the client  into  a  mental  set  for  developing  positive  expectations  for  the  future.  Positive expectations  about  improving  one's  condition  are  fundamental  to  success  in  virtually anything, but are especially important in the healing arts. Why go through treatment if you don't expect some benefit? Age progression patterns are the bridge to get from here to  there,  from  now  to  later.  If  the  imagination  doesn't  create  new  directions,  the  will doesn't have anyplace to go but around and around.\nTable  11  below  contains  a  general  age  progression  strategy  that  may  be  adapted  to individual  needs  in  the  context  of  psychotherapy.  This  strategy  illustrates  the  idea  of\nsequencing  steps  in  a  hypnotic  process  in  an  effort  to  facilitate  the  greatest  degree  of responsiveness in the client.\nThe  general  strategy  involves  11  steps,  described  as  follows:  Step  1  involves  an suggestions  that\ninduction  of  any  type.  Step  2  involves  offering  a  set  of verifiable establish a momentum for responding positively to the clinician. Step 3 involves offering at  least  two  metaphors  regarding  the  future  (e.g.,  changes  will  happen  in  science,  in medicine, in society, and so forth), indirectly orienting the client to future possibilities. Step 4 involves identifying specific resources (e.g., intelligence, sensitivity, perseverance) existing in the client that are valuable. Step 5 involves identifying specific future  situations  the  client  will  be  facing  that  are  a  basis  for  concern.  Step  6  involves associating the existing client resources to the likely future contexts where they would be helpful. Step 7 provides an opportunity for a 'rehearsal'\nTable 11.

Step 8 provides a chance to identify several other contexts where that same new application of a skill would also be helpful. Step  9  involves  specific  suggestions  to  use  the  skill  in  contexts  wherever  it  would  be helpful. Step 10 brings the future-oriented work to a close and re-establishes the ties to the current context. The final step is guiding the individual out of hypnosis.\nHopelessness and helplessness are routinely found in clients in distress. Age progression as a means of building a realistic sense of hope, and as a way of empowering the person to take charge of his or her life, is a vital component of good therapy.",

        "text": "Hypnotic amnesia is a suggested loss of memory, and can be most simply described as the  experience of forgetting something. In  both hypnosis research and clinical practice, hypnotic amnesia generally involves the inability to recall  items  specifically  suggested (either directly or indirectly) to be unavailable for recall, and subsequent recall when the amnesia suggestion is reversed (Dixon & Laurence, 1992). The quality of the amnesia may be broad in scope (e.g., childhood memory before age nine) or may be specific to a certain  type  or  category  of  information  (e.g.,  what  happened  during  the  robbery).  As Theodore X.Barber (2000) described in his discussion of the 'amnesia prone' individual, the quality of a person's amnesia and the proneness toward amnesia may be important both diagnostically and therapeutically.\nHypnotic  amnesia  has  been  the  subject  of  considerable  research  in  the  domain  of experimental  hypnosis.  Suggested  and  reversible  amnesias  hold  the  potential  to  reveal much about the cognitive basis for memory and other unconscious processes. There have been  many  different  viewpoints  developed  over  the  years,  ranging  from  the  view  of hypnotic amnesia as a socially prescribed role enactment (Spanos, 1986; Spanos, Radtke, &  Dubreuil,  1982),  an  'unmotivated'  but  prescribed  forgetting  (Bowers  &  Davidson, 1991),  and  a  prescribed  breakdown of  specific  memory mechanisms  (Kihlstrom, 1980, 1987).\nWhenever  you  try  to  remember  something,  you  attempt  to  bring  information  from somewhere in your unconscious into conscious awareness. Until you read this sentence, you were very probably not thinking of your old neighborhood where you grew up. That memory, however, is in your unconscious until you gain conscious access to it. Not all memories are available to be brought into conscious awareness, though. Some experiences were too superficially attended to and were not incorporated into long-term memory, while others had no personal meaning and thus were not integrated into memory in  any  recoverable  way  (Johnson,  1991;  Parkin,  1993).  Still  others  were  so  personally threatening that they had to be defended against. The classic defense mechanism called 'repression'  operating  in  tandem  with  dissociation  are  the  primary  mechanisms  of hypnotic or structured amnesia. Repression and dissociation refer to the mind's ability to 'split off' threatening thoughts, experiences, feelings, and impulses in the unconscious, allowing the person the opportunity to avoid consciously having to acknowledge and deal with  the  threat  (Spiegel,  1986,  1993).  Therapeutically,  the  goal  of  many  forms  of treatment involving such traumatic memories has been to uncover and 'work through' them. The delicate issues surrounding amnesia have already been described.\nIn everyday living, examples of forgetting that parallel hypnotic amnesia are abundant. Lost  keys,  forgotten  phone  numbers,  missed  appointments,  forgotten  names  of  people you know you know, missed assignments, showing up on the wrong day for a meeting or date, forgetting details of significant experiences, and forgetting where  you  hid something important are common examples. There are countless opportunities in daily life  to  observe  people  forgetting  things  that  may,  on  the  surface,  seem  unforgettable.\nThere  are  conditions  which  serve  to  enhance  memory,  and  there  are  conditions  which serve to interfere with memory. Some of these are biological in nature, as Ernest Rossi described in his considerations of state-dependent learning (1996, 1998, 2001), and some are  social  and  situational.  Structuring  someone's  experience  hypnotically  to  create  the conditions  in  which  information  can  be  'split  off'  in  order  to  deliberately  create  an amnesia may occasionally be a goal in the course of treatment. Why might a clinician want to foster amnesia in a client?\nThere  is  often  a  detectable  motivation  for  the  act  of  forgetting,  a  reason  why,  even though the reason  may objectively seem a  poor  one.  Classic  psychoanalysis  is  a  longterm  process  of  recovering  repressed  memories,  particularly  those  of  childhood,  and bringing them  into  conscious  awareness  as  'insights.' Having  insight  into one's motivations and associated intrapsychic dynamics is thought to be the primary vehicle of change  by  a  number  of  different  schools  of  psychodynamic  psychotherapy,  primarily those in which the conscious mind's role is considered to be the most significant in the process  of  change  (Nash,  1991).  Herein  lies  a  fundamental  difference  between  the utilization  approach  to  hypnosis  and  other  therapeutic  approaches  which  emphasize developing greater conscious awareness. The utilization approach emphasizes the greater positive potentials of unconscious processes, and thus makes considerable use of amnesia whenever possible  (Haley,  1973;  Zeig,  1980).  The  unconscious  is  considered  to  be  an active  and  capable  part  of  each  person,  able  to  integrate  memories  and  learnings  into patterns of living that allow the person to cope. It is impor-tant to point out that a coping mechanism may allow a person to manage without it necessarily being adaptive for him or her (evidenced in the self-destructive coping mechanisms people commonly use such as excessive alcohol intake, overeating, and so forth). Is the unconscious really capable of organizing responses and patterns of coping independent of conscious understanding? It is tempting to think of an unconscious that can be trusted to generate positive responses to life stressors, but clearly such a one-dimensional view of the unconscious isn't tenable, as discussed earlier. However, there are responses formed at unconscious levels that are, in  fact,  helpful  to  the  individual.  Thus,  the  use  of  amnesia  to  split  off  conscious awareness to focus on the unconscious may have therapeutic utility.\nWhen  the unconscious is able to integrate new  information that has special significance,  perhaps  because  of  its  point  of  origin  (e.g.,  the  suggestions  of  a  trusted therapist) and its relevance, synergistically added to the motivation to change, the client can  undergo  changes  seemingly  with  little  or  no  awareness  for  how  the  change  took place. For example, are you conscious of specific reasons why you no longer either like or  wear  that  expensive  piece  of  clothing  you  bought  just  a  short  while  ago  that  you thought  was  so  great  at  the  time?  Probably  not.  The  change  in  your  attitude  'just happened.'\nMilton  Erickson  was  a  firm  believer  that  the  unconscious  can  be  more  powerful  in generating  changes  than  any  other  part  of  the  person,  and  that  if  the  appropriate information  is  provided  to  the  client's  unconscious  from  within  his  or  her  frame  of reference,  ideally  with  minimal  interference  from  the  conscious  mind,  the  unconscious could  effect  rapid  and  lasting  change.  Consequently,  Erickson  developed  a  variety  of ways  to  facilitate  amnesia  in  order  to  promote  change  at  an  unconscious  level  (Zeig, 1985).  By  inducing  the  client to consciously  forget  the various suggestions  and\nexperiences  provided,  one  can  enable  the  client's  unconscious  to  form  its  own  unique response, free to use the hypnotic  suggestions  and  experience  as  creatively and idiosyncratically as it desires. More often than not, the client's solution catalyzed by the clinician's suggestions is more creative than the clinician's.\nBeyond  offering  therapeutic  suggestions  to  the  unconscious  mind  for  it  to  use  its hidden  resources  for  problem-solving,  amnesia  can  be  and  frequently  is  used  more directly to deliberately help repress and dissociate hurtful memories  if deemed appropriate to do so (Lankton, 2001). Caution must be exercised in facilitating repression by  assuring  the  client  that  the  memory  is  not  gone  forever,  that  it  is  only  going  to  be 'stored in a safe place…where it need not interfere with your daily living…' In the event that,  for  whatever  reason,  the  client  needs  to  have  access  to  that  memory,  it  can  be available since it has only been set aside, not eliminated (remember, the mind is not a computer whose 'tapes' can be erased). Suggestions for amnesia in such cases are likely to  be  accepted  only  when  some  healing  (i.e.,  resolution,  catharsis)  has  occurred  first (Dolan,  1991;  Murray-Jobsis,  1995).  Additional  suggestions  that  dissociate  the  intense feelings from the memory can also be offered. (See the section on 'Dissociation' later in this  chapter.)  Then,  in  the  event  the  client  does  re-experience  the  memory,  it  can  be without all the intense emotions previously associated with it.\nAmnesia is a common characteristic of deeper hypnotic experiences. When the client emerges from hypnosis, he or she may have little or no recollection for what the hypnotic experience involved, even if no direct suggestion for amnesia was offered. Such amnesia is  referred  to  as  'spontaneous  amnesia'  for  obvious  reasons.  If  amnesia  is  a  specific response the clinician wants the client to develop, gambling on spontaneous amnesia is not a certain bet; rather, playing a more active role in facilitating amnesia increases the likelihood of obtaining the amnesia response in the client.\nAmnesia  is  not  automatic  with  hypnosis,  as  many  erroneously  believe.  In  fact,  for those who rely greatly on intellectual means of self-control, paying careful attention and remembering  everything  that  happens  may  reduce  anxiety.  Inducing  amnesia  in  such persons, as might be expected, is a bit more difficult. If a client is motivated to remember suggestions and experiences, he or she will. When spontaneous amnesia occurs, it is, in part, a reflection of the client's trust in the clinician's skills. It indicates the client didn't feel the need to scrutinize everything the clinician did.\nDeciding what things a client should and shouldn't be aware of is one more area of responsibility on the part of the clinician. Ultimately, of course, the client is free to accept or reject whatever suggestions he or she chooses, but the clinician can influence the client in undesirable ways, as you may  recall from the earlier discussion of human suggestibility.  Amnesia  can  be  a  very  tricky  process,  and  its  power,  like  that  of  the unconscious, is easy to underestimate.",

        "text": "Amnesia, more than any of the other various hypnotic phenomena, is less likely to be obtained the more directly the clinician suggests it. Suggesting to someone that he or she 'forget  everything  that  took  place  during  this  time'  can  be  very  threatening,  even  to  a responsive and obedient client. In facilitating amnesia in clients, the indirect approaches\nare much more palatable to people, in my experience.\nIf a direct approach to amnesia is employed, it is probably more likely to be accepted if offered in a more permissive manner. The following is an example: 'You can choose to forget about that experience now, because it no longer has a place in your life…'\nIndirect  approaches  may  take  a  variety  of  forms,  including  indirect  suggestions, attentional shifts, and confusional suggestions. Indirect suggestions for amnesia create the possibility of amnesia occurring without your overtly asking for it as a specific response. The following is an example of an indirect and distracting approach to amnesia:\n…and as you continue to relax, each breath soothing you… I wonder how much attention you have paid to the different thoughts floating through your mind… your  mind  can  be  so  active  while  it  relaxes…and  then  you  can  realize  how difficult it is to remember what I was talking about exactly seven minutes ago… and you could try to remember what I was saying nine minutes ago, or what you were thinking four minutes ago, but doesn't it seem like much too much work to try  and  remember?…it  takes  more  effort  than  it's  worth…and  so  why  not  let yourself relax comfortably…knowing you don't have to remember when it's too much work to…\nThe above example is indirect because it doesn't specifically suggest to the client he or she forget, it only describes the difficulties of remembering. Another indirect suggestion for amnesia  is: 'You  can  remember  from  this experience what you choose to remember…'  This  suggestion  carries  the  unspoken  implication  that,  'You  can  forget what  you  choose  to  forget.'  I  view  this  suggestion  as  a  respectful  way  of  offering amnesia as a choice for the client to make without me demanding it.\nAnother  indirect  approach  to  facilitating  amnesia  is  the  'attentional  shift.'  The mechanism  for  this  approach  is  easy  to  understand  when  you  consider  a  routine interaction: You say to your friend, 'I have something I have to tell you.' Your friend says, 'Well, I have something to tell you, too, and it's really important so let me tell you first.'  You agree, and so you listen and then respond to your friend's concern. Finally, when he or she is through, he or she says, 'OK, now what were you going to tell me?' and you say, 'Uh, well, gee, I uh…forgot.' The irritating but predictable response from the  other  person  then  is,  'Well,  it  must  not  have  been  very  important!'  What  actually took place? Your attention was on a particular 'track,' a particular line of thought. But when you leave that track in order to attend to your friend's input, the flow of thought was  interrupted  and  was  difficult  to  retrieve,  thus  creating  a  temporary  amnesia.  The reverse phenomenon happens as well: You have information 'on the tip of your tongue,' but the harder you try to remember it the more elusive it is. Only when you divert your attention  away  from  deliberate  effort  to  recall  it  does  it  eventually  float  back  into awareness.\nShifts in attention obviously have an impact on how information goes back and forth between the conscious and unconscious minds. Deliberately shifting the client's attention away from his or her hypnotic experience is one way to get him or her to 'jump tracks' and thereby develop amnesia for the hypnosis. To do this, when the client is disengaging from hypnosis, the clinician can gracefully and congruently distract him or her by having\nhim or her respond to something totally irrelevant to the content of the hypnosis session. For  example,  the  clinician  can  look  bothered  and  say  something  like,  'Oh,  I  just remembered.  I  needed  to  ask  you  which  tests  you  had  done  at  your  last  physical examination.  Do  you  recall?'  By  encouraging  the  client  to  abruptly  shift  into  thinking about  his  or  her  last  physical  examination  (or  whatever),  you  give  the  client  no opportunity to consciously analyze the hypnotic experience he or she just had, and it can therefore  integrate  at  an  unconscious  level.  (You  won't  know  whether  the  person's unconscious has integrated anything, however, until subsequent meetings when you have the  opportunity  to  find  out  if  anything  has  changed,  and  what  degree  of  conscious awareness  the  person  has  for how things  changed.)  Discouraging  conscious  analysis inhibits  opportunities  for  the  client  to  pick  apart  or  reject  dimensions  of  the  hypnotic experience that such conscious analysis might deem irrational. (Hypnosis sessions often involve  suggesting  experiences,  such  as  'floating  peacefully  through  space  and  time,' that  may  be  emotionally  powerful  but  are  logically  impossible.)  The  unconscious  can respond meaningfully to things that make very little sense to the conscious mind, a point which leads me to the next approach for facilitating amnesia.\nConfusion  as  an  induction  technique  was  discussed  earlier.  Confusional  suggestions may  also  be  used  to  facilitate  the  various  hypnotic  phenomena,  and  can  be  especially useful in obtaining amnesia. In responding to confusional suggestions, the client becomes increasingly focused on trying to make sense of them. As in the previous approach, the client's attention shifts from where it was to the current confusing inputs, but the added element of the person's motivation to form a meaningful response can make for an even more powerful approach to eliciting amnesia. The following is an example of a confusion technique for the purpose of facilitating amnesia:\n…and  now  that  you've  had  the  opportunity  in  this  session  to  discover  new possibilities…while you can learn from past experiences…your conscious mind can begin to wonder…how it will know which things to remember…and which things  only  your  unconscious  need  know…and  then  you  can  remember…to forget…or you may choose to forget to remember…but when you remember to forget what you've forgotten to remember…your memory of forgetting forgets what it has forgotten…but you can only forget what you've forgotten when you realize it's too difficult to remember anyway…and then you can forget all the confusion and relax even more deeply.\nAs more of the client's attention is engaged to sort out the confusion, the unconscious can respond to the suggestions for forgetting. Whereas the attentional shift is typically used at the close of the hypnosis session (although not necessarily so), the confusion approach can be easily integrated at any point in the hypnotic process.\nTable 12.

Further study of the nature of human memory is also recommended to guide one's developing skills in the use of amnesia.

        "text": "Hypnotically  induced  analgesia  and  anesthesia  exist  on  a  continuum  of  diminishing bodily sensation. Hypnotic analgesia generally refers to a reduction in the sensation of pain, allowing other sensations (e.g., pressure, temperature, position) that orient the client to his or her body to remain. Hypnotic anesthesia generally refers to a complete or near complete elimination of sensation in all or part of the body. Applications and approaches for analgesia and anesthesia overlap to a great extent, and so for the sake of simplicity only the term 'analgesia' will be used in this discussion of these hypnotic phenomena.\nHypnotically induced analgesia is truly one of the most remarkable capacities human\nbeings  have.  The  potential  to  reduce  pain  to  a  manageable  level  or  even  eliminate  it altogether is one of the most meaningful applications of clinical hypnosis. Given the large number of people suffering with chronic and debilitating pain, and the potential for any of  us  to  suffer  pain  from  injuries  and  medical  conditions,  the  value  of  any  tool  for managing pain  effectively  is  obvious.  Consequently,  pain  relief  through  hypnosis  may well be the most intensively studied of all the hypnotic phenomena, and may also be the most empirically well-supported application of hypnosis.\nIn  a  recent  meta-analysis  evaluating  the  merits  of  hypnotically  induced  analgesia conducted by Montgomery, DuHamel, and Redd (2000), hypnosis provided significant pain  relief  for  about  75%  of  the  population.  Further  analysis  indicates  that  hypnosis appears  to  be  at  least  as  effective  as  other  nonphysical  approaches,  such  as  cognitivebehavioral pain management approaches (Syrjala, Cummings, & Donaldson, 1992). And, there  is  evidence  that  when  hypnosis  is  added  to  standard  patient-controlled  sedation, hypnosis  affords  significantly  greater  pain  relief  than  does  conscious  sedation  alone (Lang  et  al.,  2000).  Hypnosis  is  not  addictive;  it  is  empowering  to  the  patient,  and  it encourages a healthy proactive role in managing pain (Chaves, 1989; Chaves & Dworkin, 1997).\nHypnosis has been used successfully in the treatment of all kinds of painful conditions, including  headache  (J.Barber,  1996a;  Olness,  MacDonald,  &  Uden,  1987;  Spinhoven, Linssen, Van Dyck, & Zitman, 1992), burns (Ewin, 1983; Patterson, 1996; Patterson & Ptacek,  1997),  cancer  (Genuis,  1995;  Levitan,  1992;  Lynch,  1999),  dental  conditions (Hassett,  1994;  Mulligan,  1996),  surgical  procedures  (Bejenke,  1996),  irritable  bowel syndrome (Galovski & Blanchard, 1998; Gonsalkorale, Houghton, & Whorwell, 2002), and many, many other conditions.\nThe  use  of  hypnosis  in  pain  management  necessarily  involves  eliciting  hypnotic analgesia or anesthesia. Unlike chemical anesthesia, hypnosis involves a perceptual, and therefore  mental,  component.  How  exactly  hypnotic  analgesia  works  continues  to  be  a mystery. It does not appear to be either placebo or mere stress inoculation, nor does it seem to involve the  brain's  natural  opiate  receptors,  endorphins  (Goldstein  &  Hilgard, 1975;  Spiegel  &  Albert,  1983).  Ernest  Hilgard  developed  his  neodissociation  model, based  in  part  on  his  studies  of  hypnotic  analgesia,  well  described  in  the  classic  text, Hypnosis in the Relief of Pain (Hilgard & Hilgard, 1994). Hilgard was able to show in his experiments that subjects who successfully developed hypnotically suggested analgesia still had an awareness for their pain (1986). Subjects reported their pain was reduced to easily  managed  levels  and  dissociated  from  their  awareness  enough  to  be  considered insignificant.\nWorking  with  clients  in  pain  requires  a  broad  base  of  understanding  of  hypnotic principles, human physiology, psychological motivations, human information processing, and interpersonal dynamics (Eimer & Freeman, 1998). Clients in pain are, in some ways, easier  to  work  with  because  of  their  (usually)  high  level  of  motivation.  In  other  ways, however, such clients are exceptionally difficult to work with because of the intensity and pervasiveness of the negative impact of the pain on their lives. Therefore, approaching the person in pain must be done sensitively, with an appreciation that the pain is usually more  than  only  pain:  It  is  also  a  source  of  anxiety,  feelings  of  helplessness  and depression,  increased  dependency,  and  restricted  social  contact.  Even  pain  emanating\nfrom  clearly  organic  causes  has  psychological  components  to  it,  particularly  how  the suffering  person  experiences  the  pain  and  its  consequences.  It  is  the  psychological dimension of the pain that is most overtly affected by hypnosis for a variety of reasons that  all  seem  to  stem  from  the  greater  self-mastery  hypnosis  affords.  Fear  and  anxiety, feelings  of  helplessness,  and  negative  expectations  can  all  be  reduced  with  the  use  of hypnosis. The physical components of the pain are also addressed by the use of hypnosis, as  evidenced  in  the  various  healing  strategies  employing  hypnotic  patterns  (Barber, 1996b).\nAs  mentioned  earlier,  to  date  no  specific  mechanism  has  been  identified  that  can adequately  account  for  the  physical  effect  of  hypnosis  on  the  person  in  pain.  Helen Crawford  and  her  colleagues  (1998)  have  described  the  general  analgesia  process  as involving  attentional  focus  and  attentional  shifts  'in  that  persons  inhibit  incoming sensations from awareness while often simultaneously deploying their attention elsewhere'  (p. 1). This is a general description suggesting  an ability to inhibit attentiveness and responsiveness to incoming pain stimuli. How exactly this happens and how  such  attentional  attenuation  leads  to  diminished  sensory  awareness  is  a  mystery. Understanding and explaining how hypnosis physiologically reduces pain is one of the most fascinating and highly researched areas of inquiry in the field of psychophysiology.\nFortunately,  effective  use  of  hypnotic  analgesia  is  not  contingent  on  having  its neurophysiological mechanism(s) defined. The person in pain is capable of using his or her mind to change the perception of the pain in ways that will be described shortly, and this ability is amplified with hypnosis.\nHypnotic analgesia is one of the classical hypnotic phenomena that people react to with the most skepticism, asking, 'If a person is in pain from cancer or some other physical cause, how can something psychological make a difference?' Most people even go a step further  and  hold  the  misconcep-tion  that  if  the  person's  pain  is  reduced  or  eliminated through  hypnosis,  'then  it  must  have  been  all  in  his  or  her  head  in  the  first  place.' Nothing is  further  from  the  truth.  First,  hypnosis  and  the  various  hypnotic  phenomena (including analgesia and anesthesia) are evident, at least in part, in everyday experiences. Second, as was pointed out earlier, pain that is primarily physical in origin also has very real psychological  components.  The  relationship  between  pain  and  anxiety  and/or depression  is  an  intense,  circular  one.  Pain  causes  anxiety  and/or  depression,  which intensifies the pain, which intensifies the anxiety and/or depression, and so on. By merely facilitating the relaxation hypnosis affords, one can interrupt the cycle (Eimer, 2000).\nConsider  routine  experiences  that  closely  approximate  the  experience  of  hypnotic analgesia.  You can probably recall  a time when you were very involved in an activity (perhaps while playing a sport, fixing a car, moving furniture, gardening, or the like), and only after the activity's completion did you notice you had cut or bruised yourself-and only then did it begin to hurt! Your awareness was distracted away from noticing genuine physical damage-the essence of hypnotic analgesia. The injury was real, but how much you noticed it and how much it affected you varied with your focus either on or away from it. Employing hypnosis to facilitate analgesia can give one at least partial control over  the  experience  of  pain  through  a  deliberate  procedure,  rather  than  such  useful distraction being only a seemingly random event. The fact that pain is modifiable through hypnosis is not indicative that the person's pain is psychogenic. Instead, it is indicative",

        "text": "that our experience of our bodies is malleable and even negotiable.\nUsing hypnosis in the management of pain is advantageous for some very important reasons. First, and foremost in my opinion, is the opportunity for greater self-control and, therefore,  greater  personal  responsibility  for  one's  level  of  well-being  (Daniel,  1999; Hornyak,  1999).  Feeling  victimized,  whether  by  pain,  circumstances,  or  other  people, puts one in a helpless position from which it is difficult to do any real healing. Having some degree of self-control is extremely important to the person in pain, and hypnosis facilitates its acquisition (Bejenke, 1996; Ginandes, 2002). Second, because the ability to experience hypnosis is a natural one existing within the person, pain medications may be reduced  or  even  eliminated.  Hypnosis  has  no  negative  side  effects,  nor  is  it  addictive. Pain is reduced in differing degrees in different people, but whatever the quality of result, it is obtained safely and naturally. Third, hypnosis permits a higher level of functioning and  enhances  the  healing  process  in  persons  who  utilize  hypnotic  patterns  (Barretta  & Barretta, 2001). Remaining as active as one's condition allows is important at all levels, and  can  make  a  significant  difference  in  its  course.  The  expectation  of  wellness,  the experience of comfort, and the diminished anxiety and fear can all be important factors in facilitating recovery at most, or retarding decline, at least (J.Barber, 1996b).\nDeveloping  the  ability  to  help  your  clients  by  offering  effective  approaches  to  pain management can be invaluable, but a few words of caution are in order. First, pain is a warning sign that something is wrong. Appropriate medical evaluation must necessarily be the first step well before hypnosis is applied. The various hypnotic approaches should be regarded as essentially 'Band-Aids,'™ for while they may assist the client in being more comfortable, their healing abilities remain uncertain. Yes, there is some evidence that  hypnosis  promotes healing,  and  a  cautious  optimism  is  reasonable,  but  procedures and results across people are quite variable and do not justify telling clients anything that approximates 'hypnosis will heal you' (Kalt, 2000; Rossi, 2001).\nA person's pain must be viewed as a danger sign, and appropriate medical evaluation and treatment are not only encouraged, they are demanded . Harm can too easily be done if the pain is transformed hypnotically with little or no knowledge of its cause. Delaying or discouraging appropriate medical care is tantamount to malpractice. Second, if you are  not  either  medically  licensed  or  medically  supervised,  you  should  not  be  working with  pain  at  all.  Period.  Practicing  outside  the  realm  of  your  qualifications  is  also tantamount  to  malpractice.  Third,  simply  working  with  a  person  in  pain  without recognition  for  the  meaning  of  the  pain  in  the  person's  life  is  a  potentially  dangerous oversimplification  of  the  problem.  Each  person's  life  can  be  thought  of  in  terms  of  its many  components.  The  underlying  needs  (i.e.,  motivations,  dynamics)  as  well  as  the pain's  impact  on  a  variety  of  levels  (personal,  familial,  professional,  etc.)  must  be acknowledged  and  considered  in  the  formulation  of  each  person's  treatment  plan (Ginandes, 2002; Zeig & Geary, 2001).\nIn  sum,  hypnosis  can  offer  physical  relief  and  an  emotional  wellspring  of  positive possibilities to the person in pain. Over time and with practice, such persons can benefit greatly from the increased self-control and self-reliance hypnosis may afford.",

        "text": "Analgesia can be a deliberate and directly stated goal for hypnosis sessions, and directly suggested  as  a  desired  response.  And,  analgesia  can  be  an  indirect  consequence  of hypnosis  since  it  often  arises  spontaneously  during  hypnosis  for  the  client  who  is sufficiently  absorbed  in  the  experience  and  experiences  a  sense  of  detachment  (i.e., dissociation) from his or her body. When people experience detachment, and when they are so absorbed they don't even move (i.e., catalepsy), analgesia is likely to be present as well. Therefore, any approach that successfully shifts the person's awareness away from the bodily sensation(s) under consideration (ranging from specific locations to the whole body)  can  have  an  indirect  analgesic  effect.  With  training  and  reinforcing  practice sessions,  the  client  in  pain  can  learn  to  distract  him-  or  herself,  and  then  refocus  on positive ideas, feelings, memories, or whatever he or she chooses as a focal point. The teaching of self-hypnosis is essential in order for this approach to the management of pain to extend beyond relief obtained in the clinician's office.\nA considerable number of direct and indirect strategies can be employed to facilitate analgesia (Chaves, 1993; Eimer, 2000; Weitzenhoffer, 2000; Zeig & Geary, 2001). Table 13 below lists the most common forms of hypnotic pain management. The few presented in  detail  in  this  section  include  direct  suggestion  of  analgesia,  glove  anesthesia,  pain displacement, and physical dissociation. The rest are mentioned at the end of this section.\nDirect  suggestion  of  analgesia  as  an  approach  involves  offering  suggestions  for  the lack of sensation in the specific part of the client that is painful. If, for example, a client is experiencing pain in his or her abdomen, a direct analgesia approach might be structured as follows:\n…and as you feel your arms and legs getting heavier…you can see the muscles in your abdomen loosening…relaxing…as if they were guitar strings you were slowly unwinding…and as you see those muscles in your abdomen relax…you can feel a pleasant tingle…the tingle of comfort… and whenever you have had a part of you become numb, like an arm or leg that fell asleep…you could feel that  same  tingle…like  the  pleasing  tingle  in  your  abdomen  now…tingling more…and isn't it both interesting and soothing to discover the sensation of no sensation there? That's right…the  sensation  of no  sensation…a  tingling, pleasing comfortable feeling of numb-ness there .\nWhen you suggest the 'sensation of no sensation' directly in the client's abdomen, he or she  can  experience  diminished  sensation  and  direct  relief  in  the  troublesome  area. However, there is also likely to be greater resis",

Directly suggesting numbness or the feeling of just having received an injection of Novocaine will likely  be  effective  with  the  more  responsive  clients  (J.Barber,  1996b;  Crawford  et  al., 1998; Eimer, 2000).\nAnother  (slightly  less)  direct  approach  is  the  'glove  anesthesia.'  In  this  sensory alteration  process,  the  client  is  given  suggestions  to  experience  full  numbness  (i.e., anesthesia) in either or both of his or her hands. Most people seem to be able to do this, if not  fully,  at  least  in  part.  When  the  glove  anesthesia  has  been  accomplished,  further suggestions may be given that the anesthesia can be effectively transferred to whatever part  of  his  or  her  body  he  or  she  chooses.  Glove  anesthesia  permits  a  mobility  for  the anesthesia when the clinician suggests that a touch of the anesthetized hand to any part of the body will directly transfer the sensation of numbness to that spot. (In contrast, a direct suggestion for analgesia does not have such mobility, since it is localized to a specific, fixed  spot.)  This  is  particularly  helpful  when  the  location  of  the  person's  pain  varies: today it is here, but yesterday it was there. Suggestions for glove anesthesia might take the following form:\n…and in a moment, when I take your hand with your permission, I'm going to place it in a position it can stay in easily and comfortably (clinician takes the client's hand and props it up on the elbow)…and you can easily hold your hand in  this  elevated  position…and  as  you  do  so  you  can  notice  how…this  hand begins to feel different from your other one…more distant and even removed\nfrom  you…more  distant…and  while  the  rest  of  you  remains  warm  and comfortable…this distant hand can begin to experience a sensation of coolness…almost as if a cold wind were floating over your hand…cooling it, chilling it…and as your hand gets comfortably colder…and still colder…while the rest of you remains comfortably warm…the pleasantly cool feelings in your hand  get stronger…  cooler…colder…and  as  your  hand  continues  to  get comfortably colder…it can tingle pleasantly with a cool numbness…and when I touch  your  hand…you  can  realize  that  the  only  sensation  you  feel  is  a  cool numbness…and you can place your hand anywhere else on your body you'd like to feel that same cool pleasant numbness….\nIn  the  above  example  of  glove  anesthesia,  the  sensation  of  numbness  is  built  around  a suggested  change  in  perception  of  temperature,  that  is,  the  coolness  of  the  hand. Descriptively  suggesting  in  sensory  detail  the  experience  of  making  snowballs  barehanded, or the experience of reaching into the freezer for a tray of ice cubes, can help facilitate the experience of coolness and numbness.\nAnother approach to elicit analgesia involves the displacement of the pain. This might mean 'moving the pain' (shifting the perception of the location of pain from one area to another more easily tolerated one), or it might mean restricting the perception of the pain to a smaller and less inconvenient area. For example, a client experiencing pain in his or her arm might be given the following suggestions for displacement:\n…as  you  start  to  recall  how  you  learned  long  ago  about  your  body..  .  as  all people eventually must…you might begin to remember learning how delicately but wonderfully balanced the body is…a muscle that allows you to bend your leg  has  a  counterpart  that  allows  you  to  straighten  your  leg  again…and  while there are muscles that let your head lift…there are also muscles that…let your head  drop  down…deeply  relaxed…and  there  is  a  part  of  you  that  can feel comfort where  there  was  once  discomfort…and  as  the comfort  flows  into  the area  where  you'd  most  like  it …and  dislodges  the  discomfort,  letting  it  flow down…and as you feel it flowing down your arm…you can feel it collecting in your baby finger…so small there…and so easy to forget about….\nTransferring  the  pain  of  an  arm  to  a  baby  finger  can  allow  for  a  higher  level  of functioning and less preoccupation with discomfort since it can become confined to such a  small  and  more  easily  managed  part  of  the  body.  Essentially,  this  is  a  strategy  of 'symptom substitution,' the deliberate creation of a new 'outlet,' one that is now within better control.\nThe next approach to analgesia involves a variable that is operating in each of the other analgesia  approaches  as  well  as  in  hypnotic  patterns  in  general.  That  variable  is 'dissociation,'  and  it  involves  the  capacity  to  divide  one's  attentional  and  behavioral abilities. Physical dissociation causes the subjective experience of feeling separated from all  or  part  of  one's  body,  including  the  pain.  Have you ever felt, however briefly, as if your  body  was  going  through  something  you  really  weren't  a  part  of?  Even  though intellectually you knew you were 'all together' at the time, you may have felt distant and removed from the physical experience. That kind of detached experience is representative\nof dissociation. After receiving chemical anesthesia, for example, you can watch yourself get  stitches;  you  know  the  doctor  is  sewing  your  skin  together,  but  since  there  is  no feeling present, the experience can just appear to be a curious procedure you watch but from which you feel removed.\nPhysical  dissociation  as  an  approach  to  eliciting  analgesia  can  involve  guiding  the client into the subjective experience that his or her mind and body exist on two different levels. Suggestions are given that there can be sufficient distance between them for the client not to notice (or feel) what his or her body is experiencing. The following sample illustrates this approach:\n…and when your thoughts begin to travel faster than your body can keep up with…you can rediscover how your mind can travel so far and so fast…and you can  wonder  about  things  that  exist  in  the  universe…the  size  of  the  mighty ocean…the age of huge trees that seem to fill the sky…and the number of stars in the sky…things you have probably wondered about from time to time…and you  can let  your  mind  float  freely to  the  place  you  find  yourself  drawn  to… while your body stays here …comfortably here…no need to move it…no need to let it hold your mind back…you can just enjoy the freedom of letting your mind float freely…to the places you most enjoy…and while your mind is there … and your body is here …it can be so comforting to know that your body is here… waiting…comfortably. .  .  patiently  for  as  long  as  you'd  like  to  float  freely… without having to notice it…because your mind can comfortably go anywhere it wants to go….\nSuggesting that the mind 'go somewhere' encourages a physical dissociation when the body  isn't  invited  to  go  along.  Such  separation  can  be  maintained  beyond  the  formal hypnosis  session  when  posthypnotic  suggestions  are  offered  that  tie  the  capacity  for physical dissociation to events in everyday living. Posthypnotic suggestions for comfort even after the hypnosis session is a vital consideration in planning your pain management strategies for your clients.\nAs  a  final  approach  to  the  hypnotic  management  of  pain,  one  can  refer  back  to  the transcript  of  the  confusion  technique  by  Milton  Erickson  in  the  previous  chapter  on conversational hypnotic inductions. In that transcript, Erickson used a verbal confusion between 'know pain' and 'no pain' in order to facilitate the experience of comfort in his patient. Confusion captures the client's attention, leaving less awareness for discomfort (Erickson, 1966; Yapko, 1988).\nOther  approaches  to  eliciting  analgesia  include:  (1)  amnesia,  in  which  the  client  is offered  suggestions  to  forget  having  had  pain,  at  least  at  times.  This  can  interrupt  the experience  of  the  pain  being  continuous,  and  thus  paves  the  way  for  suggesting intermittent  and  increasing  periods  of  comfort  as  far  as  the  client  can  remember;  (2) gradual diminution, in which suggestions are offered that the discomfort decreases slowly over some specific span of time; (3) pseudo-orientation in time, in which the client is age progressed to a period post-recovery; (4) time distortion, in which moments of comfort can be  expanded  in  subjective  perception  (see  the  later  section  in  this  chapter  on  time distortion); and (5) regression, in which the person is age regressed back to a period that\nis prior to the pain's onset to recapture feelings of comfort.\nAs  a  final  note  on  the  hypnotic  management  of  pain,  the  wording  of  suggestions  is especially important. The word 'pain' has a strong negative emotional attachment to it, for it represents both a physical condition and an emotionally charged experience that is most  unpleasant.  Use  of  the  word  'pain,'  therefore,  should  be  avoided  whenever possible.  (When  you  read  'The  Case  of  Vicki'  in  chapter  20,  a  session  for  pain management with a terminal cancer patient, you may notice I never used the word 'pain' during  our  session,  even  though  that's  why  she  was  there.)  You  can  substitute  less charged  words  like  'pressure,'  'discomfort,'  or  'uncomfortable  sensation'  in  place  of the word 'pain.'\nIntegrating hypnotic analgesia with other therapeutic modalities can make for a wellbalanced intervention for the client in pain, regardless of the pain's source. I have been encouraged  in recent years by the number  of  medical  and  behavioral medicine practitioners discovering the viability of hypnosis as a tool in the overall treatment of the pain patient. Working hypnotically with patients in pain can be a specialty in itself, and is a most humane means for helping such patients cope with one of the most distressing and devastating human conditions.",

        "text": "Catalepsy  is  defined  as  the  inhibition  of  voluntary  movement  associated  with  intense focusing  on  a  specific  stimulus. The  degree  of  catalepsy  evident  in  a  hypnotized individual has historically been considered to be directly related to the degree of hypnotic depth  or  experiential  involvement.  The  degree  to  which  the  client  is  focused  on  the subjective associations triggered by the clinician's suggestions is the degree to which the client  can  demonstrate  cataleptic  responses.  Such  responses  may  include  a  fixed  gaze, general  immobility,  the  'waxy  flexibility'  usually  associated  with  the  catatonic  patient who maintains his or her limbs in whatever position the clinician places them, muscular rigidity,  unconscious  movements,  and  the  slowing  of  basic  physical  processes  such  as breathing,  blinking,  and  swallowing  (Weitzenhoffer,  2000).  Signs  of  catalepsy  can  be relied on to a large extent as indirect indicators of hypnosis (both formally induced and spontaneous),  or  they  may  be  directly  suggested  for  specific  therapeutic  reasons  to  be described  shortly.  Catalepsy  must  be  considered  one  of  the  most  basic  features  of hypnotic experience, for it is associated directly or indirectly with virtually every other hypnotic phenomenon. Catalepsy is the behavioral result of focusing intently on a new and different reality, whatever it may be. Catalepsy helps pave the way to let go of the 'old' reality long enough to create a therapeutic experience of age regression, analgesia, sensory distortions, or whatever.\nAs Ernest Rossi pointed out in his discussion of catalepsy (Erickson & Rossi, 1981), the so-called everyday trance (i.e., spontaneous hypnosis in the course of daily living) is a period of catalepsy where the person is daydreaming, self-absorbed, enthralled, captivated,  but  always  preoccupied  to  the  point  of  temporary  immobilization  by  the\nintensity of the focus. Routinely over dinner, for example, people stop mid-reach for the pepper (or whatever) when the conversation turns intense and absorbing for the moment. Similarly,  people  will  stand  rigidly  fixed  in  one  spot,  in  one  position,  when  more  and more of their mind is called on to make sense out of a situation that seems to require a meaningful response.\nStage  hypnotists  typically  demonstrate  a  'full  body  catalepsy'  by  suggesting  the volunteer develop extreme stiffness of the entire body (e.g., 'It is as if your body is a long, thick  piece  of  wood')  and  then  suspending the subject's  rigid body  between two chairs.  Some  add  a  little  more  dramatic  flair  to  the  demonstration  by  standing  on  the subject while he or she is suspended in that way. Suggestions to the client for a part of the body to be stiff and rigid, such as an arm (e.g., 'Your arm is so stiff and rigid that you will  find  yourself  unable  to  bend  it'),  is  a  demonstration  of  'arm  catalepsy,'  if  those suggestions  are  accepted.  Suggestions  to  the  client  that  'the  eyelids  or  eye  muscles  of your closed eyes are so rigid or relaxed as to prevent your eyes from opening' may be accepted by the client, resulting in 'eye catalepsy.'\nSuggestions  of  catalepsy  are  frequently  used  to  assess  a  client's  responsiveness  to suggestion,  as  you  may  recall  from  the  discussion  of  suggestibility  tests.  Responses  to arm levitation procedures and the special 'Handshake Technique' that Milton Erickson developed  (Gilligan,  1987),  as  well  as  to  various  other  pattern-interruption  approaches are  overt  demonstrations  of  catalepsy.  Arm  levitation  as  a  suggested  response  shows  a catalepsy of the arm suspended in mid-air. The Handshake Technique involves initiating a routine handshake with someone, then interrupting the usual sequence of making hand contact by doing something else at the moment (e.g., bending over to tie one's shoes) just before hands would have touched. The other person's hand is left suspended in air, and the individual is now more externally oriented and responsive as he or she tries to make sense out of such an unusual situation.\nFor a long time, catalepsy was considered to merely be a passive response on the part of  the  client,  but  then  again  so  was  hypnosis  in  general  (Watkins,  1987).  In  order  for someone to focus  so  intently  on  the  suggestions  of  the  clinician,  the  demonstration  of catalepsy must be viewed in the same way as hypnotic responses in general-as an active and  dynamic  process  requiring  the  proactive  formulation  of  meaningful  responses. Catalepsy implies an intense internal absorption on one or more levels that also indicates a  high  degree  of  activity  and  receptiveness  to  the  guidance  of  the  clinician  on  other levels.  This  is  why  a  client  focused  on  one  level  may  have  his  or  her  arm  placed  in  a position and leave it there, literally too preoccupied with other more immediate things to think about than expending effort to move it (J.Barber, 1996b).\nThere  are  numerous  therapeutic  purposes  for  eliciting  catalepsy,  but  they  can  be described in two general ways. Catalepsy can either serve to facilitate further hypnotic involvement through the client's recognition of his or her own unconscious mind's ability to respond in automatic ways, or it can be a target response in itself. Catalepsy as a target response may be used, for example, to assist any client whose physical movements need to  be  minimized in order to recover more quickly and comfortably (e.g., back injuries, burns). As a catalyst of further hypnotic experience, catalepsy can be a basis for securing and maintaining attention (thus serving as an inducer 'as you discover yourself getting more mentally focused and your body becomes too heavy to move'), facilitating greater\nindependent activity of the unconscious mind and increasing the degree of involvement or focus of the client (thus a deepener).",

        "text": "Anything that captures the intense interest of the client can facilitate cataleptic responses, including interesting stories, surprises or shocks, and confusion. Thus, catalepsy can and typically does arise as a spontaneous hypnotic phenomenon even if you don't suggest it. Eliciting  catalepsy  as  a  response  from  the  client  can  be  accomplished  directly  or indirectly, verbally and nonverbally, as desired. Direct suggestions for arm catalepsy are evident in the following suggestions for arm levitation:\n…as you continue to breathe in…and out…at a rate that's comfortable for you, …you can start to notice which of your arms is beginning to feel lighter than the other…light,  almost  weightless…and  your  hand  can  begin  to  float  easily  and effortlessly…rising…that's right…lifting without any effort on your part…your hand and arm can float in the air as if attached to a very large helium balloon,… and you can be surprised to discover how pleasurable it is to experience your arm floating straight out before you…as if it were completely weightless,…and it can stay there effortlessly while you begin to notice another sensation that can be of even greater interest to you….\nAn indirect way to encourage catalepsy is to offer general suggestions for relaxation and immobility, such as in the following:\n…it  can  feel  so  good  to  you  to  know  your  body  knows  how  to  take  care  of itself…it knows how to breathe comfortably …in, and slowly out… effortlessly…and it knows how to relax deeply …and you will keep on breathing effortlessly…as your mind drifts off to some special memory…a memory you haven't thought about in a long, long time…and it also knows how to sit quietly still while you get absorbed in enjoying that memory …and isn't it comforting… and soothing…to know your arms can rest heavily on the chair with no need to move them?…and it takes more effort than it's worth to move when you are so comfortable….\nBoth of the  above examples are obviously examples of verbal approaches for eliciting catalepsy.  The  use  of  gestures  and  touch  can  facilitate  catalepsy  on  a  nonverbal  level. You  can  model  catalepsy  as  you  begin  your  induction,  showing  a  fixed  gaze  and  a reduction in movement as you proceed.\nMany beginning students of hypnosis feel anxious and pressured to 'make something happen'  when  they  first  learn  to  perform  inductions.  This  may  show  up  as  trying  too hard,  showing  exaggerated  gestures,  speaking  quickly  and  with  dramatic  flair,  and  the like.\nIn facilitating catalepsy, the best thing you have going for you is yourself. Using your body  as  a  model,  you  can  deliberately  shift  from  the  animated  patterns  of  routine conversation to a demonstration to your client of the potential immobility of hypnosis. By\ngradually  focusing  yourself  intently  on  your  client,  suspending  bodily  movement,  and verbalizing your suggestions in an increasingly slow, absorbed, 'hypnotic' way (employing the communication patterns described throughout), you are modeling to your client the possibility for catalepsy. If the rapport is adequate, your client can follow your leads.  Often,  the  only  barrier  to  effective  hypnotic  induction  and  utilization  is  the clinician's distracting demeanor! As a client, it is difficult to get into a relaxed, focused state when your guide is continually shifting positions, flailing his or her arms, gesturing, note  taking,  and  so  forth.  Using  yourself  as  a  model  for  catalepsy  can  be  a  powerful means  for  facilitating  the  hypnotic  experience  for  the  client.  You  can  even  go  a  step further  in  modeling  by  gesturing  slowly  and  deliberately  stopping  mid-gesture  at  wellchosen  times  as  if  preoccupied,  thereby  demonstrating  the  possibility  of  being  so absorbed in thought as to lose track of voluntary motions.\nCatalepsy takes a variety of forms, and as a constant feature of the hypnotic experience is a necessary hypnotic phenomenon to understand. Many advanced techniques build on the  unconscious  responses  associated  with  catalepsy,  particularly  those  that  emphasize mind-body  healing  (Rossi  &  Cheek,  1988).  While  general  immobility  is  the  typical application  or  sign  of  catalepsy,  remember  that  catalepsy  has  been  defined  as  the inhibition of voluntary movement,  which  leaves  ample  room  for involuntary or unconscious movement. The client in hypnosis may move in unconscious ways that are considered cataleptic, discussed later in the section on ideodynamic responses.",

        "text": "Dissociation  is  defined  as  the  ability  to  break  a  global  experience  into  its  component parts,  amplifying  awareness  for  one  part  while  diminishing  awareness  for  the  others. Most clinicians learn about dissociation in the course of their clinical training, but almost invariably  in  the  context  of  psychopathology,  as  in  the  dissociative  disorders  (such  as Dissociative Identity Disorder,  Psychogenic  Amnesia,  fugue  states,  and  the  like). Dissociation is considered to be a basic response of people in trauma (e.g., a rape victim reporting she was floating above her body during the attack, an experiential detachment), and  dissociation  is  thought  to  be  so  extreme  in  some  instances  that  a  person  can dissociate  and  develop  amnesia  for  intense  and  prolonged  trauma  (Cardeña,  1994). Dissociation  defensively  applied  in  such  a  way  has  been  linked  to  the  onset  of  the dissociative disorders (T.Barber, 2000; Spiegel, 1993). In fact, however, dissociation, like the  other  hypnotic  phenomena,  is  neutral,  capable  of  being  applied  for  positive  or negative  purposes.  Dissociation  to  repress  trauma  that  deteriorates  into  a  dissociative identity disorder is clearly an unhealthy adaptation. In contrast, in the earlier section on analgesia,  you  learned  about  dissociation  as  a  pain  management  strategy,  a  potentially helpful application of the same principles. It's important to appreciate that what defines the positive or negative value of some process is the outcome it generates, and not the process itself.\nIn  the  domain  of  clinical  hypnosis,  dissociation  relates  to  the  more  autonomous\nfunctioning  of  the  conscious  and  unconscious  minds  in  contrast  to  their  normal,  more integrated functioning. Dissociation allows for the separation of different mental controls as Ernest Hilgard described in his neodissociation model of hypnosis, briefly described in chapter 3 (Hilgard, 1986, 1992). Dissociation as a hypnotic phenomenon allows for all the intriguing possibilities hypnosis as a tool affords.\nDissociation  is  a  natural  experience,  for  all  persons  are  capable  of  processing  and responding to information in ways they are not even aware of. On a daily basis, people talk  to  disembodied  voices  through  an  instrument  called  the  'telephone.'  Physical processes go on routinely (e.g., blinking, swallowing, adjusting the body, breathing, etc.) without any conscious involvement whatsoever. Each person has had the experience of feeling divided within him- or herself, as if simultaneously both participant and observer in some experience. Even common cliches reflect dissociated states: 'I'm beside myself with joy,' 'Part of me wants to go, but another part of me doesn't,' 'I'm out of my head to do this.'\nThrough dissociation, people do not have to be attached to their immediate experience, involved, and 'present.' They can 'go through the motions,' but not really be 'there.' The  conscious  mind  can  drift  off  somewhere,  preoccupied  with  whatever  else  has  its attention, and therefore the person's unconscious is freer to respond in whatever way it chooses. The deeper the hypnotic experience, the greater the degree of dissociation and the greater the opportunity for non-conscious responses. Hypnosis is by its very nature a dissociative experience. And, dissociation is the defining characteristic of hypnosis: You can  be  in  hypnosis  without  being  relaxed,  but  you  can't  be  in  hypnosis  without some degree of dissociation being evident.\nDissociation may be used in a wide variety of ways. Splitting an integrated experience into parts can make for some very interesting possibilities. For example, one might split the  intellectual  component  of  an  experience  from  the  emotional  component.  Helping someone who is confused to distinguish their beliefs from their feelings would be helpful.\nThis particular thought/feeling dissociative phenomenon is demonstrated routinely in many stage hypnosis shows. The stage hypnotist suggests to the subject that he or she imagine (positively hallucinate) watching the funniest movie he or she has ever seen. The subject  complies  and  begins  to  laugh  uproariously.  Then  the  stage  hypnotist  has  the subject hallucinate seeing the saddest movie he or she has ever seen, and now the subject begins to cry, often with real tears. Many stage hypnotists then ask the subject, 'What is so funny or sad about the movie?' and the typical subject responds by saying, 'I don't know!' The subject isn't merely reluctant to describe what events transpired in the movie to generate such apparently intense emotions. Rather, the subject simply doesn't know, as he or she truthfully stated. The stage hypnotist has suggested experiencing the emotion of funny or sad, but the feeling is not associated with a particular memory; it is a feeling dissociated  from  a  particular  context. The  fact  that  a  (dissociated)  feeling  can  exist without  being  attached  to  a  situation  is  something  too  many  therapists  involved  in  the repressed memory controversy didn't understand. If a client reported, 'I have the feeling I might have been abused, but I have no such memories,' therapists erroneously assumed that  wherever  there's  a  feeling,  there's  a  situation  associated  with  it  to  account  for  it. Then they went looking for situations that would justify the feelings, often unwittingly creating them in the process through the process of confabulation (i.e., filling in gaps in\nmemory  with  imagined  experiences  that  are  virtually  indistinguishable  from  authentic memories). Hopefully, you now have much better insight into the relationship between memory, trauma, and suggestibility through your study of hypnosis.\nDissociation allows for the automatic, or spontaneous, responses of the client to occur; the forgotten memory can be remembered, the hand can lift unconsciously, the body can forget to move or notice sensation, and so forth. Facilitating the expression of a specific part of a person can have profound therapeutic impact. Finding and treating the part of the client that has felt weak and powerless, for example, when other parts of the person feel strong and able enough to take meaningful risks can give the clinician an opportunity to  help  the  client  resolve  a  troublesome  problem  that  has  existed  'for  no  apparent reason.'  As  another  example,  addressing  the  unconscious  part  of  the  person  who  is feeling weak, powerless, and angry in the context of an intimate relationship can allow him or her to fortify that part in a way that is adaptive. Giving that part the opportunity to express itself more directly can help rid him or her of that part's previous symptomatic mode of expression (Hornyak, 1999). Hypnosis in conjunction with ego state therapy has been an especially well-developed model for working in this way (Frederick & Phillips, 1995; Hartman, 2001; Phillips & Frederick, 1995; Watkins & Watkins, 1997).\nCountless other examples of dissociation can be found in the literature on hypnosis, but the  best  examples  are  those  of  daily  living.  What  situations  do  you  observe  people responding to in an automatic way? When are people least integrated in terms of mind and body? Intellect and emotion? Past and present? Optimism and pessimism? Masculine and  feminine?  The  more  polarities  or  'parts'  you  generate  on  a  variety  of  levels  (i.e., physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual) to describe the range of experiences people are capable of, the more you can appreciate how many different interrelated parts there are of human beings; each is capable of being dissociated and amplified for clinical use.\nToo often, people have personal resources they could be using to help themselves, but these  resources  are  either  hidden  from  them  or  they  simply  don't  know  how  to  access them. In that sense, the parts of the person that may have appropriate skills for problem resolution  are  already  present  but  dissociated.  The  clinician's  role  is  to  build  new associations (i.e., cues, triggers, bridges) that will give the client access to more of his or her own abilities in the desired context. Dissociation is thus a valuable stepping stone in the process of recovery.",

        "text": "Suggestions  that  facilitate  divisions  of  experience  are  suggestions  for  dissociation.  For example,  an  induction  can  generate  a  conscious-unconscious  dissociation  (Lankton  & Lankton, 1983) simply by emphasizing the client's ability to experience things and learn things effortlessly and automatically (e.g., 'Your conscious mind is listening to me while your  unconscious  is  doing  something  even  more  important  at  a  deeper  level  than  you might realize'). The conscious mind is given ideas and experiences to focus on while the unconscious  is  encouraged  to  respond  in  other  ways  and  learn  at  levels  beyond awareness.  In  addition  to  eliciting  dissociation  during  hypnotic  induction,  dissociation can  be  facilitated  through  a  variety  of  approaches,  including  direct  suggestions  for dividing experience into parts, Erickson's 'middle of nowhere' technique, and indirect\nsuggestion of subjective divisions.\nDirect suggestions for division let the client discover (or rediscover, as the case may be) that it is possible to have experiences on different levels, and that these experiences can  occur  spontaneously,  automatically,  and  with  no  planning.  Suggestions  for  hand levitation exemplify  such  a  dissociation, as do  the other nonvolitional cataleptic movements. Suggesting analgesia by 'feeling your body resting comfortably here while you see that small part of your body that was uncomfortable way over there' is another direct suggestion for division. (You'll notice many such suggestions in The Case of Vicki in chapter 20.) Suggesting age regression by saying, 'Your feelings can go back to age six while the rest of you remains an adult with me in the here-and-now,' is yet another example of direct suggestion of dissociation. Anything you say that fits the pattern of the general  dissociative  suggestion  statement  that  'part  of  you  is  experiencing  this  while another part of you is experiencing that' is a direct suggestion for dissociation. Further examples are evident in a variety of models of psychotherapy that make abundant use of dissociation without ever really identifying it as such, including Gestalt (which emphasizes the integration of parts) and Transactional Analysis (which dissociates each person into 'Parent-Adult-Child' states).\nA technique of dissociation that Milton Erickson often used is called the 'middle of nowhere' (Zeig, 1980). Since one is guided to someplace called 'nowhere,' the paradox has the effect of dividing the person between the experience of being someplace but also being no place. An example of this approach might sound like this:\n…and when you sit that way it can become so easy to recognize that a part of you is here …but when the rest of you drifts away …and it can drift away…and you  really  don't  know  where  it  goes,  do  you?…to  the  middle  of  nowhere… where there is no time…and there is no place…in the middle of nowhere…there can just be my voice…and your thoughts…and nowhere is such a fine place to be…because  nowhere  else  can  one  be  so  free  to  be  nowhere…after  all,  you always have to be somewhere, sometime…but not now…nowhere is fine…and the middle of nowhere is a very pleasant place to be, isn't it?…\nIn this example, the client is encouraged to let him- or herself go to nowhere in particular, with no need to have any ties to anyone, any place, or any thing. As the client experiences him- or  herself  splitting  her  awareness  between  'here'  and  'there,'  the  dissociation  is intensifying.\nDissociation  is  indirectly  suggested  whenever  suggestions  for  a  particular  hypnotic phenomenon  are  offered.  Use  of  metaphors,  confusion,  and  other  forms  of  indirect suggestion all may facilitate dissociation. Metaphors are essentially stories that encourage you to leave here-and-now and go into the context of the story. Confusion as a facilitator for  dissociation is an indirect technique in which the conscious mind attempts to make sense  of  com-munication  that  seems  nonsensical.  Confusion  preoccupies  the  conscious mind struggling for clarity to the point of leaving the unconscious less well defended and more open for suggestion.\nIndirect  suggestions  for  dissociation  are  contained  in  the  following  metaphorical example:\n…and I thought it might interest you to learn that I had a similar experience to the  one  you  described…an  experience  that  taught  me  a  lot  about  myself  and others…that I'd like to tell you about…and isn't it amazing how you can learn important things from other people's experiences that…on the surface…seem so routine?…sometimes  you  can  listen  so  intently…it's  as  if  a part  of  you  is experiencing  it,  and  another  part  of  you  is  watching  yourself  go  through  the experience …wondering  what  will  happen…and  how  you'll  feel  when  it's over…and then the things that were so confusing at one level are made clear by the parts of us that understand…at  a  much  deeper  level…how  to  think creatively…and there's a creative part in everyone, I'm sure you'd agree…and in the experience I had, I found myself in a situation….\nIn this example, dissociation is suggested on a number of different occasions. A part is created  that  'experiences,'  another  part  that  'observes,'  another  that  will  'wonder,' another that can 'feel,' another that can 'clarify,' and still another that can be 'creative.' Each  of  these  parts  can  now  be  isolated,  addressed,  and  utilized  to  accomplish  some therapeutic goal. Each of these parts can be identified by the client as present in him- or herself, even though the suggestions are offered indirectly as comments by the clinician about him- or herself or as comments about people in general.\nIn  facilitating  dissociation,  the  final  consideration  for  the  clinician  is  related  to  the process of reintegration. Should the dissociated part(s) be reintegrated fully? Partially? Or not at all? Certainly an area of pain is best left dissociated, at least in part. Positive parts, such as the creative or adaptive parts, would probably need to be fully reintegrated. The task here for the clinician is to have some insight into the needs and motivations of the client in order to know what beneficial or harmful consequences might be associated with dissociating or reintegrating parts of the person. You may recall that age progression as an approach can be useful to help in this process (Torem, 1992).\nGiven the numerous daily experiences each of us has with hypnosis and dissociation, it should  be  apparent  that  all  clinical  applications  of  hypnosis  involve  making  use  of  the processes that people use routinely to create their subjective ideas of reality. Developing insight into the multifaceted nature of dissociation can have an enormous impact on the future of your clinical interventions, for in every psychological disorder known to me, an element of dissociation is present. Clinical artistry often involves re-directing dissociative processes in more adaptive directions.",

        "text": "Residents of state psychiatric hospitals will, given the chance, patiently explain to you the cultural biases against hallucinating. Generally, people find it a bit unnerving in daily life to  encounter  someone  who  is  experiencing  things  that  no  one  else  is.  Comedian  Lily Tomlin asks the question, 'Why is it that when I talk to God I'm praying, but when God talks  to  me  I'm  schizophrenic?'  Hallucinations that  are  involuntary  or  are  utilized  as  a\ncoping mechanism (albeit a highly dysfunctional one) are considered either neurological aberrations or projections from the psychotic patient's unconscious, depending on one's point of view. In any case, they are maladaptive and nonvolitional.\nHallucinations created hypnotically are suggested experiences the client can have that are  also  removed  from  current,  more  objective  realities,  but  they  are  structured  to  be adaptive and the client can accept or reject suggestions for experiencing them. Hypnotic hallucinations  allow  one  to  step  outside  conventional  reality  in  order  to  have  some beneficial  experience  that  could  not  otherwise  occur.  For  example,  one  therapeutic application  might  be  to  have  a  client  go  back  in  time  (age  regression)  and  have  a meaningful  conversation  with  a  parent  now  deceased  in  order  to  settle  some  lingering personal issues.\nA hallucination is, by definition, a sensory experience that does not arise from external stimulation. Simplistically,  there  are  at  least  five  senses  in  the  normal  human  being; hallucinations may therefore exist in any or all of the sensory systems. For the sake of simplicity,  the  kinesthetic  sense  in  this  discussion  will  include  separate  but  related sensory systems capable of detecting pressure, temperature, muscle feedback, that orient one  to  one's  body  and  position  in  space,  and  to  changes  in  motion.  It  is  possible  to hypnotically  facilitate  visual,  auditory,  kinesthetic  (tactile),  gustatory,  and  olfactory hallucinations (Edgette & Edgette, 1995). Hallucinations can be further characterized as being either 'positive' or 'negative.' These terms do not refer to the emotional impact of the hallucinations on the person experiencing it. Rather, these terms refer to the structure of the hallucinations.\nA positive hallucination  is  defined  as  having  the  (visual,  auditory,  kinesthetic, olfactory, gustatory) experience of something that is not objectively present. For example, you can take in a slow, relaxing breath, and as you inhale you can smell the fragrance of baby powder…and as you smell the fragrance of baby powder, you can realize that you have just had a positive olfactory hallucination. (That didn't hurt a bit, did it?)\nA negative  hallucination  is  not  experiencing  something  sensorily  that  is  objectively present  (the  flip-side  of  the  positive  hallucination). As  you  read  this  sentence,  your awareness  can  drift  to  a  sound  in  your  environment  that  you  didn't  notice  until  just now…and as you become aware of that sound, and the feeling of surprise that you didn't notice it earlier, you can realize that you have just had a negative auditory hallucination.\nIn  facilitating  hallucinations,  the  clinician  is  altering  awareness  for  sensory  input. Many hallucinations associated with hypnosis arise spontaneously, others are suggested either  directly  or  indirectly.  For  example,  hypnotic  analgesia  can  be  thought  of  as  a diminished  sensory  awareness  for  the  kinesthetic  level  of  experience.  It  may  arise spontaneously simply because of the catalepsy associated with hypnosis. Another way to describe  the  same  analgesic  phenomenon  is  to  say  that,  as  you  become  increasingly absorbed  on  other  sensory  levels,  perhaps  experiencing  vivid  visual  imagery,  you dissociate  and  negatively  hallucinate  kinesthetic  experience.  As  a  second  example, hypnotic amnesia can be described as the conscious forgetting of experience, but another way of describing the same phenomenon is to say the client negatively hallucinates the components of the experience. Specifically, a client might not remember what was said to him or her during hypnosis because he or she was so subjectively involved on another level that he or she negatively hallucinated the voice and suggestions of the clinician.\nPositive and negative hallucinations occur routinely in the course of everyday living. Everyday examples of positive hallucinations include having a taste for food you crave, feeling  itchy  all  over  when  you  find  an  insect  on  or  near  your  body,  thinking  you  see someone  you're  trying  to  avoid  wherever  you  turn,  hearing  someone  call  your  name when  no  one  is  around,  and  thinking  you  smell  something  burning  when  nothing  is. Everyday  examples  of  negative  hallucinations  include  not  hearing  the  doorbell  ring because you're engrossed in something, not noticing something on your way to work and then  seeing  it  one  day  and  exclaiming,  'Wow!  Where  did  that  come  from?'  and  not noticing that the milk you're drinking has gone sour until someone else tastes it and says, 'Yecch!'\nSensory  alterations  and  hallucinations  are  distinct  but  closely  related  terms. Sensory alterations are defined as changes in sensory awareness, either magnified or diminished in some way. The overlap between them exists because in order to facilitate hallucinations, the clinician must alter the client's sensory awareness, and in altering the client's  sensory  awareness,  sensory hallucinations  will  be created. The client will have one or more of his or her senses made more or less sensitive, and more or less active, depending on the desired outcome.\nHallucinations  may  be  used  therapeutically  to  immerse  the  client  in  a  situation  that can't be reproduced in the 'real' world. Guiding the client into a situation where he or she  can  experience  him-  or  herself,  or  the  world,  differently  in  some  meaningful  way obviously increases the range of his or her experience and can thus instill valuable new resources. When one gets absorbed and hallucinates the details of the experience vividly, the suggested reality can become almost as real and powerful as 'real' life. The client can then have the experience of hearing words he or she longed to hear, experiencing feelings he or she missed feeling, seeing places and people he or she needed to see, and so on. Through  suggested  hallucinations,  the  client  can  have  structured  experiences  that  can facilitate his or her personal growth and development. The 'believed-in imagination' of hypnosis is especially potent in this application (Sarbin, 1997).",

        "text": "Hallucinations  can  and  often  do  arise  spontaneously  during  the  course  of  hypnosis sessions. Negatively hallucinating one's body (e.g., 'I felt disembodied') or the voice of the  clinician  (e.g.,  'I  didn't  hear  you  after  a  while')  are  common  experiences  for  the client in hypnosis. Also common are experiences of seeing and hearing faces and voices from the past during hypnosis, perhaps even smelling the remembered person's cologne.\nTo  deliberately  facilitate  the  experience  of  hallucinations,  both  direct  and  indirect approaches  can  work  well.  Stage  hypnotists  demonstrate  a  direct  approach  to  positive visual hallucinations when they suggest to their subjects that they can laugh uproariously when they 'see the audience nude.' A direct suggestion to experience something (e.g., 'You can open your eyes and see yourself over there having that special experience') is usually  sufficient;  generally  by  the  time  a  clinician  attempts  facilitating  hallucinations, they have already attained sufficient rapport with and responsiveness in the client.\nS uggestions  for  hallucinations,  whether  positive  or  negative,  should  generally  be\noffered in a positive suggestion structure so the client knows what he or she is striving to experience. As an example, you can refer back to the earlier part of this sec-tion in which I offered you a direct suggestion for the positive olfactory hallucination of smelling baby powder. I let you know in a very direct and specific way what kind of experience you could have. In working hypnotically with a client, the more details the clinician provides, the more sensory experiences the client can have. Thus, extending an earlier example, if you want the client to see his or her deceased mother in the chair opposite him or her in order to have the meaningful conversation that never took place, the positive hallucination  will  be  enhanced  by  having  the  client  see  his  or  her  mother's  clothing, smelling her perfume, touching her shoulder, seeing her physical position, and hearing her  voice,  all  in  as  much  detail  as  possible.  All  of  these  suggestions  can  be  directly offered,  immersing  the  client  in  the  experience  more  and  more  intensely  with  each suggestion.  In  general,  positive  hallucinations  are  fairly  easily  accomplished  through direct suggestions, of which the following are some examples:\n… You can look over there and see someone you've wanted to see whom you haven't seen in a long, long time…and how does she look?…\n…  You  can  hear  a  voice  telling  you  something  you  really  shouldn't  not know…and whose voice is it?…and what does it say?…\n… You can smell the aroma of the coffee perking…and that smell brings you back to a situation you haven't remembered in a long, long time…and where are you?…\nIn the above examples, while the sensory modality in which the positive hallucination is to  occur is specified (i.e., see, hear, smell), the content of the hallucination is not. The person,  the  voice,  and  the  situation  to  be  experienced  by  the  client  in  the  above suggestions are left to the client's projections. You can now recognize these as process suggestions  for  hallucinations.  If  the  clinician  wanted  to,  it  would  be  just  as  easy  to suggest  that  the  client  see  a  specified  person,  hear  a  specified  voice,  or  experience  a particular situation, providing all the appropriate sensory details.\nIndirect suggestions may also be used to facilitate hallucinations. Suggesting that the client be aware of his or her arm is an indirect suggestion to not notice her leg. Referring back  to  the  earlier  discussion  on  negative  suggestions,  it  should  be  apparent  why  the negative suggestion, 'Don't notice the pain in your neck' as a suggestion for a negative kinesthetic hallucination won't likely work. Thus, indirect suggestions for hallucinations usually  take  the  form  of  positive  suggestions  for  experiences  that  would  preclude  the unwanted  experience.  For  example,  rather  than  directly  suggest,  'You  won't  know anyone else is present,' in order for the client to negatively hallucinate other people in the vicinity, such a negative hallucination is indirectly accomplished by directly suggesting, 'You can be alone' or by the indirect suggestion embedded in the question, 'Where did everyone else go?'\nThe following suggestions exemplify indirect suggestions for hallucinations:\n…and how does it feel to see yourself standing over there as a child?…\n…and whose voice is that that you're hearing?…\n…and  why  didn't you notice earlier that your hands were floating\neffortlessly?…\n…and when I went to the woods to hear the silence and smell the fragrance of pine needles, and I'm sure you know those sensations, too….\nIn the above examples, suggestions in the form of presuppositions are used to facilitate seeing one's self, hearing a voice, and feeling floating hands. By asking the client how it feels to see the child, whose voice it is he or she hears, or when he or she noticed his or her  hands  floating,  the  clinician  presupposes  the  client  is  having  these  experiences,  an indirect suggestion to do so. The last example is a metaphor with embedded commands to indirectly  suggest  certain  sensory  experiences.  'Hearing  the  silence'  is  also  an  indirect suggestion to negatively hallucinate ongoing auditory stimuli.\nSince the client tends to suspend reality-testing during hypnosis, he or she can more readily get absorbed in suggested realities. As you've learned, the person generally retains some sense of objective reality (recall Hilgard's 'hidden observer'), but only if the person is aware of a more  objective reality. Sometimes  a  client will get absorbed in hallucinations and not know he or she is hallucinating, as in the confabulations that lead people to believe they were abducted by hostile extraterrestrials. Thus, a clinician would have to be quite astute in making sure that sessions structured to provide hallucinatory experience are not going to inadvertently amplify or promote psychosis (Argast, Landis, & Carrell, 2001).\nAs for sensory alterations, simply consider under what conditions you might want to enhance or diminish someone's sensory capacities. Suggesting less auditory sensitivity to tinnitus (i.e., ringing in the ears), or greater auditory sensitivity to hearing the stress in a spouse's  voice  in  order  to  encourage  more  empathy  are  examples  of  appropriate suggestions for auditory sensory alterations.",

        "text": "In chapter 3 I discussed the perspective of hypnosis arising as a result of triggering the subjective associations between words and experience. You may recall that in that section I  briefly described the intense mind-body relationship, which was exemplified in a later discussion of the physical reactions associated with mental experiences when describing suggestibility  tests.  The  powerful  effects  of  conditioning  can  be  observed  in  a  lot  of different  ways  in  daily  life  since  so  much  of  our  daily  functioning  is  done  on  an automatic, unconscious level. If you had to pay attention to every single thing you did each day, by the time you got showered and dressed and ready for work it would be time to call it a day! Our automatic functioning frees the conscious mind to involve itself in higher-order activity. The automatic functions that humans are capable of exist on at least four different levels: cognitive, motoric, sensory, and affective. Collectively, these are the 'ideodynamic  responses';  individually,  the  responses  are  the  'ideocognitive  response,' the 'ideomotor response,' the 'ideosensory response,' and the 'ideoaffective response.' Each  is  an  automatic  response  generated  at  an  unconscious  level  in  response  to  a\nstimulus, either external or internal.\nThe  ideocognitive  response  is  what  cognitive  theorists  might  call  an  'automatic thought.'  These  are  the  unconscious  cognitive  associations  triggered  in  the  client's thought processes in response to the clinician's suggestions. Hypnotic processes employ all kinds of procedures to encourage so-called cognitive distortions, irrational beliefs, and unrealistic expectations  as  self-limiting  ideocognitions  to  come  to  the  surface  for identification  and  correction.  This  is  especially  the  case  when  hypnosis  is  used  in conjunction  with  cognitive-behavioral  approaches  (Yapko,  2001b;  Zarren  &  Eimer, 2001).\nThe ideomotor response is the physical manifestation of mental experience, or, in other words,  the  body's  unconscious  physical  reactions  to  one's  thoughts.  The  Chevreul's Pendulum  (described  in  chapter  11)  is  a  hokey  but  useful  demonstration  of  this relationship (Coe, 1993). Being a passenger in a car and moving to hit the brake is also an example. So-called body language is an entire category filled with thousands of examples (the  body  moves  unconsciously  as  an  analogue  to  what  is  thought  or  verbalized)  of ideomotor responses.\nThe body's movements are usually slight-so slight that they remain out of awareness (hence, unconscious), but they can usually be observed by the naked eye. Certainly they are  most  easily  measured  with  devices  such  as  the  polygraph  which  can  measure variables such as heart rate, galvanic skin response, and level of muscular tension. The polygraph is an obvious example of the ability to detect measurable changes in the body that the test subject is generally unaware of as he or she responds to questions from the examiner.\nIdeomotor  responses  may  be  facilitated  for  diagnostic  and/or  therapeutic  purposes. Diagnostically, the clinician may suggest to the client an automatic physical response to questions. For example, one might suggest that if the response to the question is 'Yes,' the  client's  head  will  slowly  nod  automatically  and  effortlessly,  and  if  the  answer  is 'No,' the client's head can shake involuntarily from side to side. It is not uncommon for a  client  to  verbalize  the  'Yes'  response  while  simultaneously  indicating  the  'No' response  with  his  or  her  head.  Which  would  you  believe?  (If  you  would  be  prone  to believe  the  verbal  response,  I  have  some  real  estate  I'd  like  to  talk  to  you  about purchasing…nothing  wrong  with  it,  it's  just  under  a  few  feet  of  water…)  While  the ideomotor response is certainly not a lie-detector, it can provide evidence of the existence of  multiple  cognitive  controls  and  conflicting  feelings  within  the  client  (Cheek  & LeCron, 1968).\nTherapeutically,  the  ideomotor  response  can  be  used  to  facilitate  dissociation,  to deepen hypnosis, as an indicator of responsiveness, and even as a means for exchange between clinician and client when such techniques as 'automatic writing' or 'automatic talking' are employed. Automatic writing refers to the ability of the client to write (or draw)  without  conscious  involvement  in  doing  so  (Hilgard,  1992).  Signing  your  name and doodling are examples of automatic writing and drawing. Automatic talking involves having  the  client  speak  without  a  conscious  involvement  in  doing  so  (Watkins,  1987). Talking to one's self, reading aloud, and absentmindedly carrying on a conversation are examples of automatic talking. Direct but permissive suggestions are given to the client, for example, that he 'can write and wait with eagerness to see what was written by your\nhand.' The cataleptic client can move in automatic, usually jerky, movements as he or she carries out ideomotor responses such as hand levitation, finger signals (suggested to the client so he or she can provide information or to indicate when he or she has finished a thought, retrieved a memory, is ready to go on, or whatever), and head nods.\nIdeosensory  responses  are  automatic  experiences  of  sensation  associated  with  the processing  of  suggestions.  Having  the  normal  range  of  sensation  and  a  kinesthetic memory  for  what  the  experience  of  the  sensation  was  provide  the  basis  for  the ideosensory response. When someone suggests that you recall the experience of having peanut butter stuck to the roof of your mouth, the sensation can come back to you quite automatically as you make sense of what was asked of you. The taste and feel of peanut butter  in  your  mouth  is  immediately  available  to  you  only  because  of  your  past experience with it. The suggestion would have no effect if you had never tasted peanut butter (or if you do not have a mouth). Describing in elaborate detail the various sensory components  associated  with  an  experience  allows  the  client  to  reexperience  those sensations to a  degree  determined  by  the  amount  and  type  of  past  personal  experience with it, and the degree of kinesthetic awareness the person generally has.\nIdeoaffective responses are the automatic emotional responses attached to the various experiences each person has. People have a diverse range of emotional responses to life's events,  each  differing  in  the  types  as  well  as  degrees  of  intensity  of  response.  It  is difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  feel  entirely  neutral  about  something.  Therefore,  as  the client experiences the suggestions of the clinician, different feelings associated with the ideas contained in the suggestions come to the surface. Buried negative feelings of hurt and  despair  can  arise  in  a  flash,  as  can  positive  feelings  of  joy  and  pleasure.  The emotional intensity of people's responses to suggestion often catch both the client and the clinician off guard. Be ready!\nIdeodynamics are simply structural components of a total experience. Every experience you have occurs on a variety of levels, each adding to the overall experience in a different and complementary way. In doing hypnosis, the ideodynamics are important variables for two  important  reasons.  First,  they  reflect  the  inner  experience  of  the  client  at  the unconscious  levels  where  change  is  sought.  Second,  they  are  a  part  of  the  current therapeutic  experience,  and  will  be  the  thought,  action,  feeling,  and  sensory-based components of the therapy that the person will recall and rely on as the basis for change in the future.",

        "text": "Unlike many of the other hypnotic phenomena, ideodynamics will occur no matter what you do. There is virtually no way the client can prevent unconscious body movements or thoughts, or keep from reexperiencing feelings and sensations. In facilitating ideodynamic  responses  hypnotically,  the  issue  becomes  one  of  whether  the  client responds  well  to  suggestions  for  specific  automatic  responses  or  not.  The  thoughts, feelings, sensations, and movements that the clinician suggests will be responded to more easily the greater the degree of dissociation present, since ideodynamics are defined as unconscious responses. Therefore, facilitating dissociation is a necessary first step before attempting procedures like automatic writing or finger signaling.\nDirect suggestions offered permissively are useful for facilitating ideodynamic responses. The following suggestions are examples of this type:\n…as you listen to me describe that experience, I wonder what thoughts will pass through your awareness that might surprise even you…(ideocognitive response)\n…as you let your body relax…your head begins to slowly drop downward… and let it do as it wishes…(ideomotor response)\n…and  as  your  muscles  continue  to  relax…you  can  feel  the  tingle  in  that spot…(ideosensory response)\n…while you remember that picture of yourself as a child…you can notice the feeling that the picture recreates within you…. (ideoaffective response)\nEach of the above suggestions directly suggests an automatic experience not consciously created. They 'just happen' as the client follows the suggestion, and the client doesn't have to will them to happen at all.\nIndirect  suggestions  for  ideodynamic  responses  are  also  very  useful,  as  long  as  the clinician  chooses  words  carefully  since  the  words  used  will  engender  the  specific response obtained. Examples of indirect suggestions for ideodynamics include:\n…as a reflex you can think you're to blame for that event happening, but a new thought  will  occur  to  you  to  make  you  seriously  doubt  it  (ideocognitive response)\n… I  don't  think  your  conscious  mind  will  know  your  unconscious  knows about that event until your finger has lifted…. (ideomotor response)\n… I wonder whether you can recall how good it feels to cool off by jumping into a cool swimming pool after feeling hot and dried out from the heat of the sun….(ideosensory response)\n… It can be a great relief to find out that what you thought would be a major car repair is only a minor one….(ideoaffective response)\nPreoccupying  the  client  with  the  content  of  the  suggestion  facilitates  the  ideodynamic response,  for  while  the  client  projects  him-  or  herself  into  the  described  situation  and attempts to make meaning of it, his or her unconscious is already responding. Identifying the  idiosyncratic  patterns  of  nonverbal  communication  each  person  uses  unconsciously can  be  a  rich  source  of  information  about  that  person.  Noticing  such  patterns  and interpreting  them  are  two  different  things,  however,  and  while  I  encourage  noticing patterns, I am not as quick to encourage their interpretation. Saying a gesture 'means' this or a posture 'means' that is a gross oversimplification and is more likely to be only a projection of the observer's unconscious than anything else.\nIdeodynamic responses are responsible for the most direct contact you will have with your client's unconscious. Doesn't that automatically entitle them to careful consideration?",

        "text": "The experience of time is a purely subjective one, meaning you experience the passing of time in your own way at any given moment. Everyone has had the experience of doing something pleasurable and fun, and discovering that what seemed like a short period of time was actually a relatively long one: 'Time flies when you're having fun.' Likewise, you have no doubt had the experience of being in situations that were difficult or boring, and after checking your watch and waiting…for what seemed like three days…you then checked  your  watch  again  and  found,  much  to  your  dis-tress,  that  only  5  minutes  had gone by. The subjective passing of time can seem much longer or much shorter than is objectively  true,  depending  on  your  focus  of  atten-tion. Such  distortions  of  time  take place  in  all  people's  experience,  and  like  all  other  experiences  that  are  subjective,  the experience  of  time  can  be  significantly  altered  in  deliberate  ways  hypnotically  with appropriate suggestions (Cooper, 1952; Edgette & Edgette, 1995; Erickson & Erickson, 1958).\nFacilitating the distortion of time in a client's perception can make for a very useful therapeutic  experience.  Think  of  situations  where  it  would  be  helpful  to  lengthen  or shorten  one's  sense  of  time:  When  a  client  is  in  pain,  for  example,  condensing  a  long period of painful existence into what seems like a very short period of time can be a most humane intervention  (Bejenke,  1996).  Expanding  the  perception  of  time  of  comfort  in between the contractions of a woman in labor can make the birthing experience a much more comfortable one.  Having  a  long  work  day  subjectively  seem  shorter  can  make  a difficult job a little easier to take. Having only a short period of clock time in which to take an examination and yet subjectively experiencing plenty of time can allow for better performance.  These  are  but  a  few  potential  examples  of  useful  applications  of  the hypnotic phenomenon of time distortion.",

        "text": "Approaches for facilitating time distortion can range from your 'simply getting out of the way' and letting time distortion arise spontaneously to the offering of direct and indirect suggestions for its deliberate elicitation. Time  distortion tends to arise with no suggestions for it at all, for once someone closes his or her eyes and becomes absorbed in internal experience (e.g., thoughts, memories, sensations, etc.), the 'real' world recedes into  the  background,  the  passage  of  time  is  generally  unimportant,  and  the  chance  to make a realistic assessment of how much clock time has elapsed is more difficult. Try this yourself: Check the time, let your eyes close, and then let your mind drift to wherever it happens to go. Open your eyes again after what you feel is five minutes of clock time. How far off are you? Did you under- or overestimate? Most people in this brief exercise would think more time had elapsed than actually did. If you ever had to be silent for an entire  minute  as  a  child  in  school,  you  know  how  only  a  minute  of  forced  silence  can seem  like  an  hour!  For  the  client  in  hypnosis,  though,  who  is  relaxed,  absorbed  in\nmeaningful  and  helpful  experience,  and  enjoying  the  experience,  the  tendency  is  to underestimate  the  passage  of  time.  The  client  typically  thinks  that  a  20-  or  30-minute session was only 5 or 10 minutes long. It's often a convincer to people that they were, in fact,  hypnotized  when  they  discover  the  big  difference  between  what  the  clock  on  the wall says and what their 'inner clock' told them.\nDirect  suggestions  for  time  distortion,  especially  when  offered  permis-sively,  can facilitate the experience well. The following are examples of direct suggestions for time distortion:\n…and it can seem to you as if a long period of time has gone by…and that you have had many hours of high-quality rest….(time expansion)\n…an hour can seem like a minute…and time can pass so quickly…when each thought passes through your mind at a rate so fast that it's easier to just let your thoughts pass quickly by than try to catch one….(time condensation)\n…your mind and body have been so busy here…and it takes so much time to do  everything  you've  done…hours  might  seem  to  have  passed  by  while  you have been so preoccupied….(time expansion)\nIndirect suggestions for time distortion gently plant the notion that the experience of time can  be  altered.  Indirect  suggestions  (e.g.,  'I  wonder  how  few  minutes  have  gone  by during  this  time…'),  stories  containing  examples  of  experiences  where  time  was distorted  (e.g.,  'I  was  so  busy  I  didn't  even  notice  how  much  time  had  elapsed'), conversational postulates (e.g., 'Are you surprised at how much you've accomplished in just a few minutes?'), and double-binds (e.g., 'Did it seem like a very long time or just sort  of  a  really  long  time  to  you?')  are  all  capable  of  facilitating  time  distortion.  The following suggestions provide another example of each:\n…keeping track of time is so difficult sometimes…and right now it's hard to know  whether  5  minutes  or  6  minutes  have  gone  by…and  how  can  anyone really  know  whether  only  5¼  minutes  have  gone  by  or  5½…or  5 6 /   or  5 8 ⅞ minutes  have  gone  by…(indirect  suggestion  for  an  expanded  experience  of time)\n… I worked with a client not long ago who felt so uncomfortable when she first  came  in…her  problem bothered her a lot…but when she closed her eyes and let herself listen to me…deeply…she forgot to notice how much time went by…and  she  let  herself  relax  so  deeply…it  seemed  like  hours  of  comfort… soothed her mind and body…and she felt so good…for a long time afterward… (metaphor regarding an experience of time distortion)\n…and you've been so comfortable sitting and listening to me, haven't you?… That's right…and it isn't easy to know how long…very long…a period of time has passed, is it?…(conversational postulate)\n…and now I wonder whether you realize how fast and short this period of time has gone by…and you can guess if you'd like…would you say it's been only  5  minutes  or  would  you  say  it's  been  as  much  as  7?…(forced  choice orienting the person to a specific time span)\nIn the first example above, by getting so specific about how much time has elapsed and framing  all  the  choices  within  a  short  period  of  time,  one  can  help  the  client  become oriented to that time frame and thus feel as if a lengthy process actually took only 5 to 6 minutes. If the clinician wants to expand time, the frame used can be an exaggerated one (e.g.,  for  a  10-minute  hypnosis  session,  the  clinician  can  suggest  how  difficult  it  is  to know if 20 or 201/2 minutes went by…). In the second example, a metaphor is offered that lets the client know he or she can be comfortable for what feels like a long time by being in hypnosis through the building of an identification between him or her and the person in  the  story.  In  the  third  example,  the  conversational  postulate  is  employed;  by asking  the  client  to  realize  how  difficult  it  is  to  assess  the  length  of  elapsed  time,  the presupposition is that a long time has passed. In the last example, the client is forced to choose between two times that are both much shorter than the actual time elapsed. Time can be expanded by making the forced (double-bind) choices much longer than the actual time elapsed.\nWhen clients disengage from hypnosis and discover how distorted their perception of time  has  been,  they  know  they  have  experienced  something  out  of  the  ordinary.  The result  can  be  a  new  respect  for  the  complexity  and  sophistication  of  their  own  inner world.  A  boost  in  self-esteem  accomplished  so  easily  is  one  of  the  most  positive dimensions of doing hypnosis.",

        "text": "As good as it feels to be in hypnosis, eventually you have to disengage from the hypnotic experience  and  move  on  with  your  day.  Disengagement  is  the  final  stage  of  hypnotic interaction. The client may indicate a readiness to disengage through a diminished focus of his or her attention and by beginning to move and stretch. The clinician has to make a decision at the moment of observing such signs as to whether the work is done for that session or whether the client's initiation of disengagement is some form of avoidance that can be addressed therapeutically.\nThe clinician is directing the therapy session, and should generally be the one to decide when  initiating  disengagement  is  appropriate,  just  as  he  or  she  decides  when  the induction of hypnosis is appropriate. In deciding when disengagement is appropriate, the clinician can also decide on what the manner of disengagement will be. When and how to disengage is a matter of individual clinical judgment, based on the overall treatment plan and  the  accomplishments  of  that  specific  session.  The  clinician  has,  by  this  time, employed a suggestion style and structure in his or her approach to the client, and the disengagement  can  be  consistent  with  these.  If  the  clinician  has  been  relatively  direct throughout, he or she can offer such suggestions as the following for disengagement:\n… You can bring yourself out of hypnosis at a rate that is comfortable for you… taking  as  much  time  as  you'd  like  to  in  order  to  comfortably  complete  this experience for yourself….\n… When you're ready, you can open your eyes and reorient yourself to the here-and-now, feeling relaxed and refreshed….",

        "text": "… When you open your eyes in about 1 minute and rediscover the outside world…you'll be able to notice how good it feels to have been in hypnosis….\nMost  direct approaches to disengagement  (traditionally called 'awakening')  have employed an authoritarian counting method, e.g., 'I'm going to count to three and snap my  fingers  and  you  will  then  be  wide  awake…'  Such  an  approach  is  not  particularly respectful of the client's need to disengage from the hypnotic experience at his or her own rate. Expecting a client to respond to an arbitrary count and come out of hypnosis simply because you want him or her to does not allow the client whatever time he or she may want to complete the experience for him or herself. Furthermore, expecting any human being to respond to a finger snap is simply degrading and undesirable.\nIf the hypnosis session has been an informal, spontaneous one, the clinician can choose to be consistent in his or her approach by offering indirect suggestions for disengagement. The following suggestions are exemplary of such an approach:\n…and I wonder whether you've realized how comfortable it has been to let your mind  consider  that  possibility…and  that  can  certainly  be  an eye-opening experience….\n…and after a nice rest such as the one you've just had you can certainly alert yourself to the joys of living….\n…did I tell you how I learned about that?… I was so preoccupied with myself that  I  didn't  notice  things  around  me  much…but  one  can become  less  selfabsorbed and move  around in  the  world  and notice  things  outside  yourself … opening your eyes to new possibilities….\nIn  deciding  on  the  when  and  how  of  disengagement,  the  clinician  can  consider  such factors as whether  amnesia  is  desirable  to suggest  and  what  type(s), if any, of posthypnotic  suggestions  might  be  offered.  How  the  hypnotic  experience  is  concluded will have a significant impact on the client, since human memory is generally stronger for the most recent events (the 'recency effect'). In other words, the feeling the client has as he or she dis-engages from hypnosis are the feelings he or she is most likely to associate with  the  whole  hypnotic  experience.  This  is  another  reason  why  it  is  usually  the  best option  to  allow  him  or  her  the  time  he  or  she  wants  or  needs  to  complete  his  or  her processing of the events of the hypnosis session. Letting the client disengage at his or her own chosen rate allows him or her the opportunity to feel relaxed and unhurried under your care.",

        "text": "Knowing the basic forms of suggestion structure, the fundamentals of hypnotic induction, and the potential  shifts  in  experience  associated  with  various  hypnotic  phenomena,  we can  now  focus  more  specifically  on  developing  hypnotic  and  strategic  approaches  to treatment. In this chapter, I will consider some of the practical foundational principles for introducing and integrating hypnosis into the therapeutic context. How will you decide what exactly  to  say  to  a  client  who  is  suffering  when  you  know  that  each  word,  each phrase, you employ has the potential to make a positive difference?\nThe key word in the previous sentence is 'potential.' There should be no illusion on your part that if you say everything just 'right,' as if you could even if you wanted to, you will  be  successful.  As  you  have  learned  in  previous  chapters,  there  are  many  factors influencing the outcome of an intervention, hypnotic or otherwise. Some of these factors are in your control (e.g., your choice of wording and your sense of timing) and some of these factors are not in your control (e.g., your client's idiosyncratic interpretation of your meaning,  medication  side  effects,  and  the  residuals  of  your  client's  past  treatment history).  This  chapter  is  meant  to  provide  some  guidance  in  helping  you  control  the things you can in order to increase your potential effectiveness in applying hypnosis in treatment. Clinical skill counts for a lot (even though it doesn't account for everything), and many of the considerations in this chapter are meant to enhance your clinical skills in applying hypnosis.",

        "text": "There are many practitioners of hypnosis who know how to perform hypnotic techniques. However, I believe there is an important distinction to make between doing hypnosis and being hypnotic. Someone reading an impersonal script to a client may be doing hypnosis, but I don't believe he or she can necessarily be considered hypnotic (although he or she might be). Someone who is detached from the client and the process, who has the idea that what he or she says is less important than the person's susceptibility measure, is not likely to be very hypnotic. Being hypnotic means being able to fully engage the person, being so attuned and connected to the client that you are difficult to ignore or take lightly because what you're doing and what you're offering is so relevant and absorbing.\nThink about those people that grab and hold your attention-the people that you don't want  to  take  your  eyes  off.  What  about  them  grabs  you  and  holds  your  attention? Whatever that quality is, that's hypnotic, even though the person isn't necessarily doing hypnosis. When are you hypnotic? Are you aware of those special times in therapy when\nyour clients seem riveted to your every word?\nIn  doing  hypnosis,  it's  a  distinction  between  moving  a  client  through  an  arbitrary procedure that has no inherent meaningfulness, such as an utterly arbitrary method like a 'countdown induction method' (what's meaningful or absorbing about counting numbers-unless  you're  an  accountant?),  versus  stimulating  personally  meaningful associations in a client through  individualized suggestions that acknowledge  and incorporate his or her uniqueness (Rossi, 1980; Zeig, 2001).\nBeing hypnotic means engaging purposefully with people, accepting the responsibility for being an agent of influence and change, and striving to use your capacity for influence intelligently  and  sensitively.  Being  hypnotic  also  means  knowing  that  the  capacity  for being  absorbing,  engaging,  and  influential  doesn't  only  happen  when  formal  induction takes place. Being hypnotic simply means incorporating hypnotic principles of focusing people and introducing positive possibilities to them into your very way of being, and is thus revealed through each interaction to one degree or another.",

        "text": "The  skills  needed  to  be  an  effective  clinician,  in  contrast  to  those  needed  to  merely perform an induction, are substantial. These include a broad knowledge of current clinical literature, an ability to relate to the client and form a therapeutic alliance, and an ability to organize  and  direct  a  well-structured  intervention.  These  are  all  complex  skills  which require significant investments of time and effort to develop.\nWho we are as people is the foundation onto which the veneer of our clinical training is  later  glued.  Consider for a moment why you structure your clinical practice the way you  do.  What  does  it  say  about  you  as  a  person  that  you  maintain  your  individual philosophy of treatment, are attracted to and strive to practice well a particular style of therapy, and practice in such a way as to even try to lead your clients to believe as you do, however directly or indirectly you may do that?\nThis is hardly a new concept. We've known for a very long time that we get attracted to  and  practice  therapy,  including  our  hypnotic  interventions,  on  the  basis  of  what  we subjectively find appealing. Someone goes to a hypnosis workshop and learns about and experiences an 'inner sage' induction technique, for example, discovering some previously untapped inner wisdom, and thought it was an inspiring experience. So, he or she goes back to work with a new enthusiasm and starts doing 'inner sage' techniques with almost every client. Or, someone goes to a conference on the new and controversial 'XYZ Disorder' and then starts seeing it in clients never previously known to have 'it.' As you've already discovered in the Frames of Reference sections throughout this book, the gifted experts each have their own viewpoint, just as you have yours. And yours will be the determining factor in whether and how you apply hypnosis.\nIdeally,  our  personal  backgrounds  and  interests  should  not  be  the  primary  basis  for designing  and  delivering  our  interventions,  hypnotic  or  otherwise.  In  the  'real  world,' however, all of our clinical training prepares us to focus in on 'this' but not 'that' when we interview our clients, so we may understand what's going on 'this' way and then treat it 'that' way. Having a philosophy or belief system to provide you a foundation is both\nnecessary and desirable. Perhaps where clinicians sometimes err, though, is when they only see things one way and don't stretch themselves to consider how other perspectives might  help  in  understanding  and  addressing  the  problem.  Almost  any  problem  can credibly be understood and treated from many different viewpoints. It seems important, to  me  at  least,  to  distinguish  between  the  facts  of  a  case  and  the  interpretations  or inferences  you  might  make  when  designing  your  intervention  so  your  inferences  don't become dogma.",

        "text": "As I have stated previously, the value of a specific therapeutic technique or a generic tool like hypnosis is largely determined by the context in which it is applied. Any approach has the potential not only to fail, but even be damaging to the client if the therapeutic context  doesn't  support  its  use. It  goes  well  beyond  the  scope  of  this  introductory textbook  on  clinical  hypnosis  to  try  to  address  all  the  salient  clinical  skills  needed  to establish a therapeutic context, but I can at least draw your attention in a general way to some of them.\nSome  of  the  preliminary  considerations  include:  your  defined  professional  domain (which encompasses your academic credentials and appropriate licensure to legally and ethically do whatever you do), how you obtain referrals, how you represent the nature of the  work  you  do  to  potential  clients  and  to  referral  sources,  your  agreed-upon  fee  for service, the length of your sessions, the frequency of your sessions, the type and amount of intake information you want (including any formal testing, whether for hypnotizability or  some  other  dimension  of  the  client's  experience),  the  nature  of  your  proposed interventions and the underlying rationale for wanting to employ them, the building of a therapeutic  alliance  with  the  client,  the  means  for  assessing  progress,  other  avenues  of treatment that may be desirable or necessary during or after your treatment, the criteria for termination and the schedule for follow-up (Lynn, Kirsch, & Rhue, 1996).\nThe rest of this chapter proceeds with the necessary assumption that you have created a therapeutic context in which your client is amenable to participating in therapy in general and hypnosis in particular. Now we can focus more directly on how to design and deliver effective hypnosis sessions.",

        "text": "couldn't help but notice, in general, how much simpler and more practical their ideas and methods were.\nWith simplicity  in  mind,  there  are  four  basic  questions  I  pose  to  myself  when  I  am working with a client. There are obviously many more I pose as well, but there are four questions in particular that help me develop a clearer focus on what I want to address in treatment  and  how  I  want  to  address  it.  Here  are  the  four  questions  I  find  helpful  in organizing my therapies:\n1. What are the client's goals? And, as a corollary, what is an appropriate order (i.e., sensible and with a likelihood of success) for addressing them?\n2. What are the resources the client will need in order to be able to accomplish the goal (s)?\n3. Does the client already have the necessary resources in his or her repertoire or in his or her history and primarily needs help mobilizing him or her? Or, does the client not have those resources and needs assistance in first identifying and then building them?\n4. How will contextualization be accomplished, i.e., how will the resource(s) be made available in the appropriate context(s)?\nThe  first question  is about  goals.  Hypnosis  is  a  directive  approach,  and  its  use presupposes a purpose, a goal to strive for. In the next section I will focus on the issue of goal setting since it is the first step in the process and creates the framework for all else that follows.\nThe  second  question  is  about  resources.  Addressing  this  second  question  skillfully presupposes that you know what skills would be necessary in order to accomplish some goal. Unfortunately, the language of therapy is often so abstract that clinicians sometimes lose track of precise meanings and the concrete actions necessary to produce a desired effect.  We  speak  the  'psychobabble'  that  employs  phrases  such  as  'building  selfesteem,' 'increasing ego strength,' 'building permeable boundaries,' and then act as if these phrases actually mean something. They represent experiences, and it is essential to know what experiences they represent. The task for me in answering this second question is  having  a  concrete  definition  of  what  exactly  the  person  needs  to  be  able  say  or  do (within themselves and/or out in the world) that would make achieving the goal possible. If there aren't specific steps to follow, then it isn't a goal. It's merely a wish.\nThe third question is about where the necessary resources will come from once they've been  identified  as  necessary.  Can  anyone  do  anything  if  they  just  have  the  proper motivation,  that  is,  'where  there's  a  will,  there's  a  way?'  I  think  that  is  a  potentially destructive notion because it defines all problems in terms of motivation alone. It would be more accurate to say, 'Where there's a will, maybe there's a way.' Motivation without the necessary abilities frustrates people. Both motivation and ability matter in treatment, and  neither  alone  will  get  the  job  done. Thus,  I  first  want  to  assess  what  abilities  the client might have he or she isn't using to his or her detriment, and then I want to create a bridge  to  them  that  makes  them  accessible.  Such  'bridge-building'  is  a  prime  use  of hypnosis. If the client doesn't have the necessary abilities to accomplish what they want or  need  to  accomplish,  then  it  becomes  my  task  in  treatment  to  provide  a  structured means for  teaching  those  skills  and  making  them  learnable.  Teaching  skills  is  another prime use of hypnosis.\nThe fourth  question  is  about  contextualization.  Having  resources  is  one  thing;  using them in an effective way at the appropriate time is another. As you learned when studying posthypnotic suggestions, the chief function of the posthypnotic suggestion is to establish an association, a link, between the desired response and the context for that response. Of course,  there  are  also  other  ways  of  building  this  association  besides  the  posthypnotic suggestion.  You  can  employ  role-playing  strategies,  cognitive  rehearsals  (e.g.,  success imageries), and homework assignments for the same purpose. The goal at this stage is simply to take what is being learned in hypnosis and therapy and be able to apply it in the course of living.\nEach of the four questions above naturally raises many others in the treatment process that are also helpful to consider. I find these questions especially helpful in helping me to get clear about what I want to say to my client during the hypnosis session, the first step in designing hypnotic interventions. Perhaps you'll find them helpful, too.",

        "text": "Clients routinely present to clinicians statements such as, 'I just want to feel better,' or 'I just  want to have a good relationship.' Statements such as these are so global as to be nothing more  than mere wishes. They  are not well-defined targets for clinical intervention. If a clinician is unclear as to what he or she specifically needs to address, the intervention will likely go nowhere. As someone wise once said, 'If you don't know where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else.' Yet, somehow a culture of magical thinking has arisen around hypnosis, promoted by those who are attracted to the rather idealistic (and self-flattering) notion of an organized and benevolent unconscious mind:  Clinicians  are  told to 'trust your  unconscious'  to  (magically)  develop  an appropriate intervention, while the client is told to 'trust your unconscious' to (magically) learn what is relevant (Bar-ber, 2000; Gilligan, 1987; Matthews, 2001).\nI don't suggest you rely on a 'trust your unconscious' approach. Instead I think there should  be  specific  information  you  gather  about  the  client's  experience,  well-defined goals you articulate and agree upon, and sensible strategies to employ in reaching them. In my opinion, the times hypnosis in particular and therapy in general work best are when there is a target to be hit and a well-defined means for doing so within the context of a good therapeutic relationship.

        "text": "David  Spiegel,  M.D.  (1945-),  is  associate  chair  of  the  Department  of Psychiatry  and  Behavioral Sciences  and Willson Professor in the School of Medicine at Stanford University. He is also the director of the Psychosocial Treatment  Laboratory  and  medical  director  of  the  Center  for  Integrative Medicine. He has been on the academic faculty at Stanford since 1975. Dr. Spiegel earned his bachelor's degree at Yale and completed his medical and\npsychiatric training at Harvard. He is a gifted researcher and teacher, and a powerful  presence  in  the  field  as  he  advocates  for  doing  scientifically informed hypnosis and psychotherapy.\nDr. Spiegel is the author of more than 350 publications, including his 1989 landmark  study  on  the  effects  of  psychosocial  treatment  on  the  survival  of patients with metastatic breast cancer. This research suggested that supportive and expressive group therapy in women with terminal disease improved their quality of life and, even more dramatically, increased their survival time. As Spiegel himself points out, this research has had mixed results in replication attempts,  but  is  an  important  line  of  inquiry.  His  ongoing  research  in  this critically  important  domain eventually led to his popular 1994 book, Living Beyond  Limits:  New  Hope  and  Help  for  Facing  Life-Threatening  Illness, which provided further data and perspective, as well as coping skill guidelines for women living with breast cancer and their families. His most recent book is called Group Therapy for Cancer Patients (2000) and is co-authored with Catherine  Classen,  Ph.D.  Dr.  Spiegel  likes  to  remind  people  that  his  work shows that survival is not merely mind over matter, but that mind does matter. His research has earned him many prestigious awards, and the highest respect from his peers.\nDr.  Spiegel  is  at  the  forefront  of  research  in  the  fields  of  psychosomatic medicine and hypnosis. His professional interest in hypnosis began early in his  career,  influenced  in  part  by  his  well-known  psychiatrist  father,  Herbert Spiegel, M.D., whom he had seen demonstrate hypnosis on many occasions. He took his first course in hypnosis while at Harvard, and in 1978, soon after completing his residency and postdoctoral fellowship, he co-authored with his father a book that many in the hypnosis community consider a classic called Trance  and  Treatment .  In  this  volume,  the  Spiegels  described  a  diagnostic system and means for evaluating hypnotic responsiveness called the Hypnotic Induction  Profile  (HIP),  described  in  chapter  14,  as  well  as  diverse  clinical applications  of  hypnosis.  Dr.  Spiegel  co-authored  a  paper  published  in  the American Journal of Psychiatry in Au-gust 2000, that received an extraordinary amount of attention for the extraordinary findings: Hypnotized research subjects given suggestions to\nhallucinate color while viewing black-and-white photographs had the parts of their brain used for color processing 'light up'  in brain scans. This remarkable  finding  suggests  strong  neurophysiological  processes  evident  in hypnotic responsiveness, helping move the field a step closer to understanding the neuroscientific underpinnings of the phenomenon  of hypnosis.\nO n  Hypnotizability  Testing: 'Hypnotizability  testing  turns  an  induction into a deduction. You acquire useful information about a person's ability to respond to hypnosis in five minutes or less. By standardizing your input, you\nmaximize what you can learn about the variance in responses to it, and use this  to  direct  your  approach  to  the  patient  and  teach  the  patient  about  their responsiveness.  You also  reduce  tension  in  the  initial  hypnotic  encounteryour role is to assess rather than talk the person into a trance, and they are exploring their ability, rather than either complying or resisting.'\nO n  Spontaneous  Hypnosis  and  Hypnotic  Ability: 'Hypnosis  occurs spontaneously,  even  without  a  formal  induction,  as  research  on  absorption indicates. Moments of 'flow,' peak performance, and intense pleasure have self-altering and intense attention as one component, and are thus hypnoticlike. While  many  people  have  such  peak  experiences,  and  some  have dissociative experiences, not everyone does. Research indicates that hypnotizability  is  as  stable  a  trait  as  IQ,  and  involves  intense  and  focused attention.  There  is  no  reason  why  human  mental  experience  should  be  any more equally distributed than human physical traits.'\nO n  Psychosocial  Support,  Hypnosis  and  Breast  Cancer: 'There  is evidence  from  some  but  not  all  studies  that  participation  in  group  therapy increases  survival  time  with  breast  cancer.  It  has  not  been  proven  that hypnosis is a key component to this effect. However, hypnosis is extremely helpful in reducing cancer-related pain and anxiety. Cancer can be understood as a stressor, and focused attention coupled with dissociation is very helpful in  managing  stress,  ranging  from  anxiety  about  dying  to  getting  through difficult  medical  procedures  with  less  pain  and  anxiety  and  even  more rapidly.'\nO n  Different  Hypnotic  Styles: 'While  each  clinician  needs  to  sample various approaches and find one that makes sense and seems most useful to patients, I feel an obligation as an investigator and teacher to find and test the crucial elements  in  treatments  that  work.  I feel there has  been  much mystification of hypnosis over the centuries, and that it is most likely to be used (and used well) in medicine when we distill the crucial\nelements and use them. I find that patients make good use of clear and direct approaches that invite their collaboration through facilitating their understanding of the treatment approach.'\nO n  Clinical  Skills  Underlying  the  Use  of  Hypnosis: 'It  is  cru  cial  for clinicians  to  have  basic  skills  in  diagnostic  assessment  and  knowledge  of various  treatment  approaches  that  can  be  utilized  both  with  and  without hypnosis. It is crucial to be a primary professional (psychiatry, psychology, dentistry,  etc.)  rather  than  a  hypnotist.  Then  it  is  most  helpful  to  learn  to communicate clearly and compassionately, and use your relationship with the patient as a therapeutic tool.'\nO n  Excitements  and  Disappointments  with  the  Field: 'I  have  been excited to discover, along with other colleagues, the profound  effects hypnosis  can  facilitate  in  affecting  brain  function,  e.g.  processing  color\nperception  and  pain,  and  body  function,  e.g.  asthma,  gastric  acid  secretion, warts.  My  biggest  disappointment  is  the  enervating  battles  over  sociocognitive vs. state explanations of hypnosis and other unnecessary turf battles. The  phenomenon  is  resilient  and  interesting  enough  that  there  is  room  for many approaches to compete productively for explanatory power.'\nS ource: Personal communication; August 5, 2002",

        "text": "In real world circumstances, unlike participants in traditional therapeutic efficacy studies who  may  be  excluded  from  the  research  if  they  have  additional  problems  beyond  the single  condition  being  investigated,  clients  have  multiple  problems,  even  multiple diagnoses.  Clinical  judgment,  an  artistic  evolutionary  development,  requires  making  a decision  about  where  to  begin.  Not  all  problems  are  equal.  Some  symptoms  are generalized  throughout  the  client's  life,  and  some  are  specific  to  particular  situations. Some are merely annoying, but some are clearly dangerous. Some are relatively easy to resolve, and some are refractory.\nThe  first  priority,  of  course,  is  what's  urgent,  and  urgency  is  governed  by  hazard potential. Suicidal ideation, drug abuse, and reckless behavior that endangers one's self or others, are just a few examples of when clinicians must establish an order of priority for  intervening  that  one  might  not  otherwise  choose  if  the  symptoms  or  problem behaviors posed no immediate danger.",

        "text": "Where to begin, though, if no symptoms or behaviors are in urgent need of immediate attention?  Generally,  it  is  best  to  begin  where  you  can  generate  some  rapid  symptom relief  and  thereby  start  to  build  a  positive  momentum  in  treatment.  One  of  the  most underemployed  but  useful  constructs  in  applying  hypnosis  is  called  the  'response set' (Erickson & Rossi, 1979), discussed previously.\nBuilding a response set means building a momentum of responsiveness. For example, if I offer someone four consecutive statements I know he or she will agree with, what is that  person's  most  likely  response  to  my  next  statement?  For  example,  if  I  say,  'Each person  is  unique  as  an  individual;…human  experience  is  often  complex;…people frequently have more resources than they realize;…sometimes it feels good just to sit and relax…'-all agreeable statements-where does the momentum of responses carry the client? Most likely into the realm of agreement for the next statement.\nIn  the  practice  of  clinical  hypnosis,  then,  effectively  utilizing  this  principle  means structuring interventions to go from general to specific. Thus, before I give someone a specific suggestion to develop an age regression, for example, I would first offer a series of general suggestions about memory that I know he or she would agree with, such as:\n'Each person  is  capable  of  remembering  many  different  experiences…some  memories are much more vivid than others….' , which gradually lead the client in the direction of later remembering or even reliving (i.e., revivifying) a specific memory.\nResponse sets can only be effectively designed and delivered when the session's goal is relatively clear. If you can't clearly state the hypnosis session's goal or your primary therapeutic message in 25 words or less, then it may be best not to do the session (unless the goal is to simply 'go fishing,' which may occasionally be a reasonable choice). An unfocused session which yields little can too easily de-motivate the client for participating in further hypnosis sessions.",

        "text": "Comprehensive treatment must take the risk factors for other problems and for relapses into account as well as current symptoms. A risk factor is any factor that increases the probability of a particular disease or disorder occurring. The risk factors to be targeted in treatment, along with their associated symptoms, represent some  of the deeper applications of hypnosis and psychotherapy. To ignore underlying risk factors and focus only on the client's symptoms is a relatively superficial intervention, addressing only the problem's content but not its structure. (The content refers to the details-the what -of the problem, while the structure refers to the process-the how -of how the symptom is produced.)\nKey risk factors to address include such self-organizing factors as: (1) Cognitive style (Abstract or concrete? Global or linear? Attributional style?); (2) Response style (Self or other-directed? Open or guarded?); (3) Attentional style (Focused or diffuse? Focused on saliency or irrelevance?); and, (4) Perceptual style (Focuses on similarities or differences between  experiences?  Magnifies  or  diminishes  events  or  perceptions?)  (Yapko,  1988). Risk factors may be addressed singly or in combination.\nThe heart of therapy, it seems to me, is in teaching clients to identify which subjective patterns will work best in a given context and then use your interventions to deliberately associate them to those patterns. It requires people to read situations accurately in order to  know  what  the  situation  requires  (e.g.,  an  impersonal  response)  and  what  specific resources one has to meet those demands (e.g., an effective strategy for reminding oneself the criticism isn't personal based on clear criteria).\nThis is precisely what people don't do, however, to their own detriment. For example, they want to self-disclose ('Let me tell you what I think of this job') but they don't read the context well in order to recognize this isn't a safe place for self-disclosure (i.e., it'll get  back  to  the  boss  and  I'll  likely  be  punished).  Misreading  or  simply  ignoring  the situational cues can thus be very costly.\n'Relating to the context' means adapting to situations flexibly. Facilitating flexibility in  clients  while  simultaneously  encouraging  them  to  be  more  observant  (therefore  less internally and more externally oriented) and critical in their thinking are primary goals of effective therapies. Hypnosis can help magnify the key learning underlying adaptability that every pattern is valuable somewhere, but no pattern is valuable everywhere (Yapko,",

Some clinicians claim one should  have  a  strong  rapport  and  therapeutic  alliance  built  over  many  sessions before doing  hypnosis  out  of  the  fear  that  hypnosis  might  be  introduced  too  early  in  the treatment process and somehow harm the alliance. I believe that position is too limited. I would suggest instead that one can often use the hypnosis itself as a means to build the necessary rapport and therapeutic alliance with a client. In fact, I demonstrate this very process with Vicki, a woman I had just met for the first time, in chapter 20.\nWhen someone is in distress, feeling hopeless and overwhelmed, it seems both cruel and entirely unnecessary to say, 'give me more of your history' and 'I'll start helping you next time.' Why shouldn't the client begin to get some help right away? Given the typically low-frustration tolerance of the distressed individual, who wants and hopes for some immediate relief, why not provide some if possible when this is one of the things hypnosis  does  best?  The  ability  of  hypnosis  to  provide  anxiety  reduction,  lowered agitation, and reduced ruminations are some of the best reasons to use hypnosis early on in  treatment  as  a  means  for  demonstrating  to  the  client  that  his  or  her  symptoms  are malleable,  effectively  building  positive  expectations  for  therapy  (Kirsch,  1990,  2000, 2001). The clinician's responsibility, even in the very first session, is to facilitate hope and meet the need for at least some relief as quickly as possible. Hypnosis can help you do both.",

One can interview a  client,  and  then  20  or  30  minutes  into  the  session,  assuming  you want to do hypnosis with the client, say something such as the following as a lead-in to the hypnosis:\nI've been listening intently to  you  now for the last half hour or so, describing your symptoms and problems, and how absorbed you have been in just trying to manage. I've been impressed by your suffering and despair, and it's obvious to me that you want things to change. Having been so focused on and absorbed in all the most hurtful thoughts and feelings, it seems obvious to me how valuable it  would  be  for  you  to start  to  consider  and  then  get  absorbed in different thoughts and feelings that  can help you feel better. You came here knowing it\nwould be important to get absorbed in a different way of looking at things, and to help you start to get absorbed in a different way of thinking and feeling you can just let your eyes close and focus yourself on some of the possibilities I want to describe to you….'\nAnd thus the hypnosis session begins. I cannot think of a single instance in all my years of  practice  in  which  a  client  refused  to  participate  or  was  even  reluctant  to  join  the process  when  I  introduced  the  purpose  of  focusing  to  them  in  this  way.  Clients  are typically looking for direction and feedback, knowing something has to change, but they are typically unclear as to what.\nThere is another style for introducing hypnosis to the client, of course, a much more conventional and structured one in which the clinician asks the client whether he or she has  worked  with  hypnosis  before  and  how  he  or  she  would  feel  about  working hypnotically  in  the  therapy.  The  clinician  draws  out  existing  attitudes  about  hypnosis, identifies and corrects any misconceptions, establishes both cooperation and expectancy by describing what hypnosis is, how it feels to be hypnotized, what the potential benefits of  hypnosis  are  in  his  or  her  particular  case,  and  so  on  (Kirsch,  Lynn,  &  Rhue,  1993). Some  clinicians  even  go  so  far  as  to  have  the  client  sign  a  release  form  authorizing hypnotic treatment as tangible evidence of informed consent.",

I recommend you choose your style based on the client's patterns of self-organization, described above, and not from some invariant formula. The idea is to be fluent in all styles, and to draw upon them flexibly as client patterns dictate.\nThere  is  a  division  in  the  field  of  hypnosis,  as  you  know  by  now,  over  the  issue  of hypnotizability as a relatively fixed trait of responsiveness, based on standardized tests. That  people  differ  in  their  responsiveness  to  hypnosis  is  a  given.  What  that  means  to clinical  practice,  however,  is  still  wide  open  for  discussion. Therapy  is  more  art  than science,  a  condition  that  is  unlikely  to  ever  change  as  long  as  therapy  remains  an interpersonal process involving subjective clinical judgment and considerable social skill (Covino, 1997). Hypnosis is even more artistry than science, utilizing subjectively created hypnotic  phenomena  such  as  regression  or  dissociation  that  arise  from  suggestive influences within the hypnotic relationship.\nI  choose  to  land  on  the  side  that  strives  to  improve  the  artistry  of  clinicians  using hypnosis. More efficacy data won't help us be better humans doing clinical work. There is simply no substitute for having the range to formulate direct and indirect suggestions, positive and negative suggestions, process and content suggestions, and authoritarian and permissive  suggestions.  Having  the  range,  the  flexibility,  to  impart  information  and perspective  in  a  variety  of  ways  is  what  clinical  artistry  is  about  (Haley,  1973;  Zeig,\n1980).  Disavowing  client  uniqueness  by  summarily  believing  that  'if  he  or  she  is hypnotizable, it won't matter how  you  phrase a suggestion,' allows ineffective suggestions to be attributed to client limitations. It makes some clinicians feel better to do that, apparently, but I'd caution against anyone really believing it. Instead, believing the client can respond to some degree, and expecting to find and striving to find a channel for meaningful shared communication is a great way to initiate hypnotic interventions.\nThus,  arguing  over  whether  direct  or  indirect  suggestions  are  superior  is  a  colossal waste of time when we should already have reached the understanding that no suggestion, direct or indirect,  is  powerful  or  useful  until  a  client chooses to  respond  to  it.  The divisiveness in the field over this and other such academic questions that are clearly of no interest to the client seeking treatment is something we cannot be proud of if we want to be socially relevant.",

        "text": "The importance of building a momentum of responsiveness cannot be overstated. Most people simply can't produce hypnotic phenomena (e.g., analgesia or regression) instantly on demand. But, given time and an atmosphere which encourages exploration, people can usually develop hypnotic responses sufficient for therapeutic purposes. Paying attention to the deliberate building of response sets is simply a way of increasing the likelihoodnot  guaranteeing-a  positive  response  to  the  hypnotic  experience.  Before  asking  your\nclient  for  a  specific  response,  you  present  ideas  in  a  general  and  irrefutable  way  that indicate such  a  response  is humanly  and  even  personally  possible.  Thus,  before attempting  to  generate  an  analgesia  in  a  specific  part  of  the  person's  body  later  in  the session, for example, it is helpful to first get the person comfortable with and attuned to the notion that noticing or even creating variations in your perception about your body is possible (e.g., 'Sometimes your body feels tired, and sometimes it feels well rested…'). In this example, the response set centers on orienting the client in a general way to the subject of variabilities in bodily perception, serving as a stepping stone to the larger goal of the session, namely, creating a specific variability in sensation with an analgesia. The response set moves the client in the direction of the larger therapeutic goal without yet demanding a specific response from him or her.",

        "text": "The advice I gave earlier was to distill your message to the client down to 25 words or less when you're planning your session so you can be clear about the session's purpose. What do you want to say to this person that is meant to be helpful? What is the client's misperception or self-limiting belief you want to address? What empowering resource(s) do you want to associate the client to? When you are clear about what the message you want  to  convey  is,  then  you  have  established  the  topic  of  your  therapeutic  theme (McNeilly, 2001). For example, if you have a client who believes he or she is a victim of circumstances and seems oblivious to proactive beneficial choices he or she could make, if you simply say to the person, 'You could make proactive beneficial choices,' the client will likely be  entirely unimpressed.  Employing  hypnosis,  however,  you  have  the opportunity to get that same important point across in a much more focused, experiential, and powerful way. So, you might introduce the salient therapeutic theme 'the importance of knowing what's controllable' to the client, with the goals in mind of motivating the person to make deliberate choices and teaching the skills of recognizing what's in his or her control as a precursory step in the direction of being proactive in living life well. The message you want to get across in 25 words or less is 'Quit acting like you're a victim and  take  charge  of  your  life!'  But  to  help  soften  that  too  abrupt  and  emotionally threatening message I need to say it in a way that's more comfortable and easier for the client  in  a  victim  mindset  to  absorb.  So,  I  might  introduce  that  theme  more  gently  by saying something such as:\n… As I continue to talk to you about different ideas and different possibilities you  might  well  become  aware  of  how  different  people  experience  life  in  very different ways… Some people think life is just whatever happens to them, while others think they can create whatever kind of life they want… Isn't it interesting how some people think they have control over the quality of life and others feel they  don't… Sometimes people overestimate how much control they have and try to control things they really cannot… While others sometimes underestimate how  much  control  they  have  and  don't  try  to  control  things  and  make  good choices  they  really  could…  It  can  be  very  confusing  to  know  what's  in  your control and what isn't, don't you think?…\nI  have  now introduced the theme and focused the person's attention on the therapeutic\nissue of controllability. A more direct approach at this stage would be to say something such as, 'You see yourself as a victim in the circumstances of your life, as if you have no control over what goes on in your life. You have more control than you realize, you are not merely a victim, and I want to talk to you about ways you can begin to take charge of your life.' The next step in the process then builds on whatever therapeutic theme you have introduced to your client at this stage in the process.",

This is the stage at which your therapeutic strategy is implemented. Are you going to try to teach the client a specific skill that can empower him or her? Attack a self-limiting belief or misconception he or she holds as true? Share a meaningful observation or philosophy about life you believe he or she can benefit from? Try to alter a perceptual process he or she engages in? Whatever your intended use of hypnosis, hopefully you have some strategy in mind for how to achieve the goal of your session. Will you make an emotional appeal by telling a moving and inspiring story of someone else's success? Or make an indirect threat as to what terrible things will happen if  continuing  on  in  the  same  way?  An  appeal  to  logic?  A  promise  of  great  personal rewards for changing?\nWhatever strategy you decide on determines the kinds of suggestions you will use to address  the  therapeutic  theme.  Direct  suggestions  to  'stop  doing  that  and  start  doing this' (e.g., telling a smoker, '…whenever you feel the urge to smoke you can go outside and slowly  and deliberately  take  in  some  deep  breaths  of  cool,  clean  air  and  you  can enjoy knowing you're gradually making yourself healthier than you have been in a very long  time…' )  are  probably  the  most  commonly  used  approaches.  Indirect  suggestions, most commonly through the use of storytelling, are also used quite commonly to suggest new  ways  of  thinking  about  and  responding  to  old  problems  (e.g., '…when  the townspeople  started  suffering  strange  symptoms,  they  finally  realized  the  damage  the smokestacks of the factory were doing to them and their families…and even though it was hard for them because the factory employed so many of them…they realized they had to shut  the  factory  down  so  they  could  start  breathing  in  clean  air  again…and  get  their health back…because what good is a job if you're sick or the people you care about are sick?…' ).\nThe suggestions you employ in addressing the therapeutic theme are meant to associate some new response(s) to the problem context. Your suggestions may also be used to give the  client  a  preview  of  homework  you  may  be  assigning  later.  You  can  do  this  by orienting  him  or  her  to  the  idea  of  what  can  be  learned  through  experience,  a  process commonly known as 'seeding,' and later assigning that experience as homework (Geary, 1994; Zeig, 1990).",

Whatever  the  intention  of  your  message,  what  your  client  actually receives may be quite different. As you've already learned, meaning is not in the words you use, rather meaning is in the person who relates to your words in idiosyncratic ways. Thus, you can give someone a direct suggestion to go take a walk outside when they feel themselves getting stressed, and all the person heard was 'take a hike!' Or you can tell someone a story about another client with a similar problem and all he or she hears is that you  talk  about  other  clients  in  your  examples.

        "text": "The session is now complete, and the process of generating closure begins. It is important to give the client the amount of time he or she needs to process what has happened during the session. Some people process things very quickly and are ready to bring the session to an end, and others are slower in assimilating new ideas and need some time to absorb it all. Most people, regardless of their rate of processing, simply enjoyed being so relaxed and  comfortable,  they  are  in  no  hurry  to  end  the  session.  So,  it  is  a  good  idea  to  first orient  the  person  to  the  idea  of  closure  (e.g., 'You  can  review  and  absorb  whatever important new possibilities you wish to as you prepare to bring this session to an end' ) before suggesting actual closure, and then you can suggest they begin to bring themselves out  of  hypnosis  at  a  comfortable  rate  ( 'And  when  you're  ready  to,  you  can  start  the process of bringing yourself out of hypnosis at a rate that is gradual and comfortable' ). No  one  likes  to  be  hurried  out  of  hypnosis,  and  it  can  be  quite  disorienting,  even uncomfortable, if the client is encouraged to come out of hypnosis too quickly. By letting the  client  control  the  rate  at  which  he  or  she  re-orients,  you  can  avoid  the  mistake  of hurrying somebody.",

The  first  moments after the person has opened his or her eyes are particularly sensitive ones as the person thinks about the session while 'reconnecting' with you. Waiting silently until the person feels like speaking is generally a good idea, although you can also quietly offer further suggestions consistent with your goals at this time, since the client is still usually partially in hypnosis.

        "text": "When the hypnosis session has ended, the opportunity exists to do some debriefing with the  client  about  the  session.  As  with  every  other  aspect  of  the  treatment  process,  this requires some thoughtful planning. On one hand, detailed de-briefing about the session (e.g.,  'How was that for you? What was your experience like?') can provide you with valuable  feedback  about  how  the  client  responded  (i.e.,  thought,  felt)  that  can  be important in shaping future sessions and even the overall direction of the treatment. On the other hand, some of the things that happen during hypnosis sessions, such as fantasy imagery  that  has  no  logical  basis  (e.g.,  visualizing  being  a  carefree  child)  can  create powerful emotional responses that are very helpful to the person to have, yet they would fall apart under conscious scrutiny. So, you have to give thought as to how much of the session you want to analyze without such an analysis being detrimental to the session's results.\nThe next opportunity for follow-up is in the next session. This is when the clinician has the chance to find out what, if anything, is now different in the client's experience. Has anything changed? If so, what? Does the client seem to have absorbed and made use of suggestions given during the hypnosis session? If so, is the client aware of having done so,  or  does  whatever  is  different  seem  outside  of  his  or  her  awareness?  The  times hypnosis is most mysterious and compelling are when the person has made changes in obvious response to the suggestions you have offered, yet the person seems to have no awareness for the connection between what you suggested and what he or she is doing differently. It gives hypnosis that 'magical' quality, which is fascinating, but which may also be clinically undesirable. If we want to empower people, having them make changes without any sense of personal connection to those changes  simply  reinforces a disempowering belief that these things happen to them instead of being caused by them. I'm a strong fan of taking the magic out of the process and replacing it with a sense of deliberateness on the part of the client, emphasizing that he or she did actively participate in some way to make changes possible. You can do that by linking new behaviors with improved conditions, asking about and reinforcing 'what's different and better.'\nWhat if the person comes back for the next session and nothing is different, or worse still,  if  things  have  actually  gotten worse? There  are  many  different  possibilities  as  to why  an  intervention  of any type,  including  hypnosis,  can  fall  flat.  Some  of  the possibilities have to do with the client (e.g., negative expectations, inadequate motivation, misapplying  suggested concepts), some  have  to do with the clinician (e.g., too emotionally threatening, too controlling, too condescending), and some have to do with the interaction between the two (e.g., inadequate rapport, conflicting goals). De-briefing the client under these circumstances becomes even more important for the clinician. Did the client listen to the tape of the session again (I tape my sessions routinely and provide them to the client as a means of reinforcing our work), and if so, what did and didn't fit for them? If something didn't fit, why?\nI  want to  know what I can do differently in subsequent sessions to be more helpful, even if it's the client's issues (e.g., negative expectations) getting in the way. I want to address  those  limitations  and  try  to  resolve  them  as  part  of  the  therapy.  But  it  means backing up a step or two to address those issues before going on in a different way. If it's my approach that needs adjusting, I'll do my best to adjust it. If it's the quality of our interaction, I'll do what I can to change what I do there, too. The important point is that feedback allows for the possibility of change, wherever in the process a change may be indicated. It may be easier to simply blame the client for his or her lack of progress, of course, but as you can tell, I'm not inclined to blame the client for what he or she doesn't know how to do. I'd rather strive  to  create  a  context  where  he  or  she  can  explore  the possibilities and learn to choose wisely.",

        "text": "Throughout this book there have been numerous descriptions of ways to apply hypnosis in  a  variety  of  clinical  contexts.  The  goals  for  each  session  and  the  steps  toward  those goals will naturally vary across clients, but there are specific themes that frequently recur in  psychotherapy.  Some  examples  are:  encouraging  people  to  take  responsibility  for themselves;  encouraging  people  to  be  proactive  on  their  own  behalf;  helping  people develop  a  better  sense  of  both  their  uniqueness  and  personal  boundaries;  and,  helping people adjust to difficult circumstances. There are, of course, many, many others.\nIn  the  same  way  there  are  common  problems  across  client  populations,  there  are common patterns of hypnosis for addressing them. In this chapter, I will describe some of these common patterns of hypnotic intervention. And, in the same way I have described the importance of treating individuals rather than diagnostic categories, I will encourage in  this  chapter  the  importance  of  tailoring  the  approach  to  the  individual. The patterns here  represent  ways  to  intervene  in  certain  types  of  problems,  but  none  of  these techniques, in fact, no techniques, are likely to be successful if the therapeutic alliance and/or  therapeutic  context  doesn't  fully  support  their  use (Cummings  &  Cummings, 2000).\nIn  the  first  section  of  this  chapter,  I'll  describe  how  to  use  hypnotic  phenomena  for both diagnostic purposes and therapeutic treatment planning. Then I'll describe some of the most basic patterns of hypnotic intervention. In this chapter's latter section, some of the  most  common  problems  you  are  likely  to  encounter  are  briefly  described,  with emphasis on how hypnosis may be employed in the treatment process. These descriptions are  all  necessarily  general  and  superficial,  appropriately  so  in  an  introductory  text,  but they will expose you to the kinds of issues and methods that a deeper exploration of the research and clinical literature can provide. The\nTable 15. Assumptions Inherent in Hypnotic Psychotherapy\nassumptions associated with the use of hypnosis in psychotherapy are presented in Table 15 as a way of orienting you to this chapter's subject matter.",

        "text": "I have previously described hypnotic phenomena as the building blocks of experience. In varying combinations and degrees of purity, the various hypnotic phenomena comprise ongoing experience, whether good or bad (Araoz, 1995). Developing the ability to view everyday  experiences  in  terms  of  the  associated  hypnotic  phenomena  can  help  you develop  the  ability  to  more  easily  identify  the  structures  of  experiences  (i.e.,  how  the problem  pattern  is  organized),  not  just  their  content  (i.e.,  what  the  symptoms  are) (Gilligan, 1987, 2001).\nIn the context of conducting therapy, identifying the hypnotic phenomena associated with a client's symptoms permits you a more rapid and comprehensive understanding of the  problem.  Knowing the sequential  steps  involved  in  the  creation  of  the  symptom(s) permits  you  the  opportunity  to  choose  at  what  point  in  the  symptomatic  sequence  you may introduce an intervention that alters it in some beneficial way (Lankton & Lankton, 1983).\nConsider the example of someone with a fear of flying. How does someone generate such  a  fear?  What  is  the  symptom  producing  internal  sequence?  Despite  individual variations,  there  is  a  general  sequence  most  airplane  phobics  follow:  They  visualize  in great  detail  the  airplane  they're  sitting  in  taking  off,  and  that  soon  after  takeoff,  the engines flame out. They visualize with horror the plane going down and crashing at top speed,  and  then  they  see  twisted  metal  and  body  parts  scattered  all  over  the  hillside. Imagining  yourself  on  an  airplane  that  is  imminently  going  to  crash  and  kill  you  is  a horrific sequence of images. With such disturbing imagery, it is easy to appreciate how a fear  of  flying  is  generated  (Wilson,  1996).  Asking  why  some-one  would  visualize  this sequence of events is unnecessary; it's self-evident, given the reality that planes do crash, albeit relatively rarely.",

        "text": "There are many different ways of treating such individuals, from deeper symbol-laden interventions  to  more  overt  cognitive-behavioral  strategies.  Hypnosis  can  be  integrated with  any  and  all  of  them,  suggesting  alternative  images  and  ways  of  thinking  about flying. Even the most superficial hypnosis approach would at least offer suggestions to think  about  flying  comfortably,  seeing  detailed  images  of  the  wonderful  things  to  be experienced  at  the  destination  and  framing  flying  as  a  liberating  experience  that  can enlarge your world. In essence, the clinician is  saying, 'Here. Visualize these relaxing images instead of those terrible images.' While the content of the visual imagery changes in such an intervention, both the solution and the problem are comprised of images of the future (i.e., elements of age progression) that feel real in the present.\nIn the same way that age progression (in the form of a fear of bad things that might happen in the future) is generally evident in anxiety disorders, it is possible to similarly characterize  other  problems  according  to  associated  hypnotic  phenomena.  Table  16 below provides some relevant principles and examples.\nConsider  the  average  smoker  from  the  perspective  of  how  hypnotic  phenomena  are evident in the pattern of smoking. Smoking is a terribly self-damaging habit, yet despite the  warning  labels  and  the  laws  passed  to  discourage  smoking,  more  than  50  million Americans continue to smoke. Most of them began as teens, and despite getting sick the first  few  times,  they  endured  and  became  dependent  on  cigarettes.  For  individuals  to smoke,  what  must  they  do  to  make  it  possible  to  inhale  smoke  and  gas  containing hundreds of deadly toxins and even proclaim to enjoy it? They are typically unaware of the immediate stress and damage to their body with each puff of the cigarette. They do not feel their heart rate and blood pressure increase as their body fights for oxygen, nor do they feel the toxins circulating through their body. They don't smell the foulness of their  clothes,  hair,  breath,  or  surroundings  (car,  home,  office),  and,  generally  speaking, they tend to be quite oblivious to the many effects of their smoking.\nTable 16. Symptom Phenomena as Hypnotic Phenomena\n1.  Identify hypnotic phenomena evident in symptomatic pattern(s), for example: Overweight: physical dissociation, sensory alteration Smoking: physical dissociation, sensory alteration Depression: age regression, catalepsy, sensory alteration Anxiety: age progression, time distortion, sensory alteration\n2.  Use complementary hypnotic phenomena in interventions\n3.  Contextualize responses through experiential approaches, such as task assignments and behavioral prescriptions\nDo you know when many people decide to quit smoking? When the elevator at work breaks! Taking the stairs highlights very quickly their degree of physical (un)fitness. Or as a result of some other similar situation where the negative effects of their smoking is dramatically brought into their awareness.\nClearly, a smoker is in a physically dissociated state. How else could one be oblivious to  the  physical  damage  associated  with  breathing  toxic  fumes?  The  main  idea  in",

        "text": "identifying hypnotic phenomena underlying symptom phenomena is that it provides you with some understanding of the kind of experience you want to encourage hypnotically. As a general principle, therapy takes the form of providing complementary experiences, helping  people  develop  either  undeveloped  or  underdeveloped  personal  resources. In smoking, for example, dissociation is a large part of the problem. Thus, association, the complement to dissociation, is going to be a large part of the solution (Lynn, Neufeld, Rhue, & Matorin, 1993). Building associational cues (triggers) to encourage an increased body  and  sensory  awareness  is  a  likely  path  to  the  successful  treatment  of  smokers (Zarren  &  Eimer,  2001;  Zeig,  1980).  Tying  both  these  cues  for  better  health  and  the redefinition  of  yourself  as  a  nonsmoker  to  the  specific  contexts  through  the  use  of posthypnotic suggestions is the final step of the treatment.\nNotice how  the intervention described here for smokers  is not based on an interpretation of the 'meaning' of the smoking. Such an interpretation of the meaning of smoking could only be my personal projection. Thus, interpreting smoking as a suicidal wish, a socially defiant behavior, an oral gratification representing a fixation at the oral stage  of  psychosexual  development,  or  any  other  such  assignment  of  meaning  is  both arbitrary  and  unprovable. What is clear, however, is that the smoker is dissociated, for whatever reason, and he or she needs to build new healthy associations to his or her body as  well  as  develop  the  other  resources  necessary  to  move  forward  in  life  without cigarettes (Bayot, Capafons, & Cardeña, 1977; Capafons & Amigo, 1995).\nThe  dissociative  aspect  of  people's  symptoms  is  an  especially  noteworthy  point  to appreciate. Clients routinely describe how the symptom 'just happens,' meaning it is not a voluntary response on the part of the individual. I generally define therapy as a process involving pattern  interruption (i.e.,  getting  the  person  to  stop  doing  one  thing)  and pattern building (i.e., getting the person to do something else), as virtually all therapies must  do.  As  discussed  early  on,  hypnosis  by  itself  cures  nothing-it's  what  happens during hypnosis  that  has  the  potential  to  be  helpful.  The  role  of  the  clinician  is  to establish  new  positive  associations  to  modify  the  client's  dysfunctional  or  self-limiting behaviors,  thoughts,  and  feelings.  Such  associations  can  best  be  built  through  direct experience,  such  as  hypnotic  processes  or  structured  learning  opportunities  (e.g.,  role plays, homework assignments, behavioral experiments, etc.).\nThe key points, then, of this section are twofold. First, utilizing hypnotic phenomena as a reference point can be a useful means for understanding symptom structures. Second, when such hypnotic phenomena are evident in the problem structure, a solution can take the  form  of  building  new  associations  through  the  use  of  complementary  hypnotic phenomena.\nAs was done in the examples listed in  Table  16 above,  it  may  be  useful  for  you  to identify  which  hypnotic  phenomena are evident in the type(s) of disorders you tend to treat most frequently.",

But,  the  patterns  described  in  this  section  are  based  on  the recognition that most people need something a little more multidimensional than direct suggestions of symptom abatement.\nIndividualizing treatment is always a necessity, in my opinion, and that means tailoring general patterns of intervention  to  the  specific  needs  of  the  client.  Patterns  range  from relatively simple and obvious to very complex and subtle. The following are some of the more  basic  and  common  hypnotic  patterns  for  intervening  in  client  problems.

        "text": "The pattern of intervention called 'Changing Personal History' has been used routinely in clinical intervention over many years, in a variety of forms and with a variety of names (Eisen,  1993;  Lankton,  2001;  Phillips,  1988).  As  you  can  gather  from  its  name,  the purpose of the intervention is to help people redefine their view of their own personal history. So often in treatment, people have come to see themselves as victims of the past, as  damaged  and  unchangeable.  This  strategy  is  appropriate  to  use  with  such  clients, particularly when a client is presenting a problem that has its origins in a hurtful episode where the person made some negative life decision that perpetuates his or her distress. For  example,  if  a  client  had  the  experience  of  being  abused  as  a  child  and  made  the decision (i.e., formed the generalization) that the world is an abusive place and people are not to be trusted or related to in a positive way, the clinician might take the client back in time (i.e., age regression) to his or her earliest memories and suggest they be 'rewritten' in order to facilitate the (imaginary) experience for him or her of feeling loved, cared for, and protected by others (Murray-Jobsis, 1996). The resources of affection and caring can be  provided  through  imagined  but  realistic  suggested  interactions,  such  as  his  or  her mother expressing love and approval when he or she brings home a good report card. The client is then guided forward through time while having a subjective sense of love and caring present across all his or her life experiences. In doing so, his or her feelings about him- or herself and others can change in a healthier direction.\nHere's  a  case  example  illustrating  the  pattern:  In  the  case  of  a  man  I  worked  with whose mother had died when he was a boy of seven, he had 'decided' (not consciously) that 'women were not to be trusted and gotten close to because they leave you.' Through age  regression  to  the  time  of  his  mother's  death,  he  remembered  feeling  abandoned, angry, and hurt and he decided then that the best way to prevent such emotional pain was to never get close to anyone, especially women. His life, as you can imagine, has been lonely and painful.\nThe  strategy  of  changing  personal  history  was  used  with  him.  When  he  was  age regressed to his fondest memories of his mother (times when he felt her closeness and love),  it  was  possible  to  make  those  good  feelings  of  having  her  around  more  readily available to him for recall when he wanted them. This was done through the building of",

The next step was to suggest amnesia during the session for the reality of his mother's death. Once this was established, we could examine his life experiences, both good and bad, and have  him  'recall'  sharing  them  with  his  mother  as  if  she  had  really  been  there.  In hypnosis, she could grow older with him and be there for him in the way he had needed her.  The  experience  of  having  his  mother  'with  him'  in  a  variety  of  very  specific  life situations  (e.g.,  preparing  for  his  first  job,  getting  his  driver's  license,  graduating  from high  school)  through  the  years  allowed  him  to  redefine  his  view  of  her  and  his relationship with her. Suddenly, his mother hadn't abandoned him and women weren't so unreliable. It served to alter his feelings and behavior toward women, especially when he had the insight that 'dying probably wasn't her idea, anyway.'\nIn helping 'change' his personal history through hypnosis, I provided a means to allow him to experience each of his life experiences with the 'missing piece,' allowing him to feel, hear, and see life from a different perspective. Did he know the life experiences with his  mother that he had re-written were imaginary? Yes, he did. Were they emotionally powerful  anyway?  Yes,  they  were.  It  is  the  power  of  hypnosis  to  help  people  get absorbed in experiences that are not objectively 'real' that makes therapeutic interventions with hypnosis potentially so therapeutic.",

        "text": "One can't go through life without experiencing trauma of one sort or another. Cars crash, people die, wars are fought, and people seem to evolve innovative ways of hurting each other.  In  addition  to  these  harsh  realities,  'everyday'  traumas  can  often  have  a  serious impact: The mean kid in class who made fun of your freckles, the practical joke at your expense that left you standing there wanting to die of embarrassment, and the thoughtless and cruel comment by a loved one that should never have been said are all examples of the  'everyday  trauma'  (i.e.,  non-life  threatening)  that  can  have  a  profound  impact  on one's life. Years later such traumas may even seem silly and irrational on a logical level, yet they can still carry a big emotional wallop. In persons who have suffered a trauma of some sort (as defined by them), the traumatic event may well have been a turning point in the person's life. If it was a turning point for the worse, which not all traumas are, then the critical incident process may be an appropriate treatment strategy (Erickson & Kubie, 1941; Spiegel, 1993, 1996).\nThis  is  an  emotionally  powerful  hypnotic  process,  intending  at  its  initial  stages  to release pent-up emotions associated with a traumatic event ('catharsis'). If the client has conscious memory for the content of the critical incident, you may simply proceed in a relatively  straightforward  way.  However,  if  the  traumatic  incident  seems  to  have  been dissociated and forgotten in whole or in part, the process is hazardous. How does one know  there's  a  hidden  trauma,  since  you  cannot  reliably  infer  this  merely  from symptoms?  Yet,  it  is  often  the  case  that  people  were  traumatized  and  because  they minimized and rationalized,  they  don't  even  recognize  themselves  as  traumatized  until the  therapist  says  some  version  of,  'My  God!  How  did  you  endure  such  horrific treatment?'  You  are  advised  to  exercise  extreme  caution  in  dealing  with  trauma,  and",

        "text": "study considerably more in-depth material than that provided here before embarking on trauma  treatment  when  the  client  has  no  clear  memories  of  the  trauma.  In  such  an instance, you can still do a critical incident process, but you must be careful to let the client work at his or her own rate and not push the client to deal with something directly he  or  she  feels  unable  to  (Dolan,  1991;  Lankton,  2001).  Ideomotor  questioning  (e.g., finger signals to provide responses) may help assess whether the client is ready, willing, and able to deal with the traumatic experience and/or the consequences in their life.\nTable 17 below provides a general structure of the critical incident process.\nTable 17. General Structure of a Critical Incident Process\nThe critical  incident  process  as  a  treatment  strategy  involves  an  age  regression  (either hypermnesia or revivification, depending on the appropriate level of emotional intensity needed to re-work the situation) back to the time of the traumatic experience. Generally, it  is  a  good  idea  to  first  do  a  regression  to  a  positive  experience,  demonstrating  to  the client  that  he  or  she  can  trust  the  clinician's  guidance,  find  comfort  (or something positive) within him- or herself, and control the hypnosis experience.\nOnce the client has become immersed in the experience, and describes it aloud so the clinician can know what's happening and how the person is interpreting the meaning of what's happening, the clinician's primary role is to offer him or her support for exploring the episode. Simultaneously, the therapist identifies and amplifies a part of the experience the client had previously not attended to, such as how insecure (angry, sick, hurt…) the other  person  involved  might  have  been,  or  how  well  he  or  she  coped  in  the  face  of adversity, or some such thing that can be used as a pivot point to start to redefine the way the traumatic episode is stored and remembered. One might strive to change the history of the situation by adding something new to the interaction to make it easier to bear (e.g.,\nsuccessfully fighting off the attacker). By supporting the client's expression of emotional pain, the clinician can usually guide him or her to a point where he or she can start to feel differently about the situation. Frequently, just having the chance to tell the story that has never been told and release some pent-up emotion in a supportive atmosphere has ample therapeutic value (Phillips, 2001; Phillips & Frederick, 1995). But, the strongest part of this  process  is  in  guiding  the  client  into  a  new  awareness  or  new  understanding  of  the meaning of the experience, redefining its place in his or her life in an empowering way To complete the process, the client can be age progressed, integrating into the future the changes in thoughts and feelings associated  with the release of  the  hurt,  bringing  with him or her new conclusions about both the critical incident and him- or herself (Watkins & Watkins, 1997).\nOne can also use the critical incident process to revivify an experience that was critical in  the  client's  life  in  a positive way.  With  the  growing  emphasis  on  a  'positive psychology'  in  the  field,  this  choice  can  be  an  especially  powerful  means  of  helping people  get  and  stay  connected  to  the  best  parts  of  themselves.  Typically,  though,  the experiences that wreak the biggest emotional havoc on people and that send them into treatment  are  traumatic  ones,  requiring  a  great  deal  of  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  the clinician. It is vital, especially when considering the excesses of the battles over the issue of repressed memories, to be judicious in one's use of trauma-focused therapies. Many clinicians I am aware of are 'emotional voyeurs' who want or need to help their clients 'get in touch with the pain.' The reality is that if you look for people's pain, you will always  find it. However,  that isn't necessarily therapeutic and may  actually be antitherapeutic . A lot of people have suffered considerably by the time they consult the clinician; guiding the client through the traumatic incident process with no precise goal in mind  beyond  'finding  the  pain'  is  capable  of  amplifying  hurt  needlessly.  Caution  is advised.",

        "text": "Many therapeutic approaches regularly make use of 'homework,' educational tasks the client is given to carry out in between therapy sessions (Cummings & Cummings, 2000). These  are  intended  to encourage  new  behaviors,  test  out  the  accuracy  of  one's perceptions,  and  amplify  particular  thoughts,  feelings,  and  behaviors  that  the  clinician judges important in the therapy. Homework assignments operate on the level of actual direct  experience, a more powerful level than the merely intellectual. Homework helps people  integrate  new  learnings  on  multiple  levels.  And,  by  assigning  homework,  the client has to expend effort, increasing the likelihood that they will value the therapy more (Lynn & Sherman, 2000).\nThe homework assignment isn't hypnosis, but it is hypnotic in its absorbing people in new frames of mind and developing deeper understandings of themselves and their life circumstances.  Homework  can  also  be  thought  of  as  an experiential  metaphor in  the treatment process. Prescribed properly, homework will address unconscious dynamics of the presenting problem(s). When the client engages in an activity that will cause him or her  to  experience  him-  or  herself  differently  while  confronting  self-limiting  thoughts, feelings,  and  behaviors,  new  associations  are  formed  and  the  desired  change  may  be\naccomplished (Lankton & Lankton, 1983, 1989).\nIn  one  case  example  involving  homework  while  working  with  a  depressed  client,  at one point in the therapy I wanted to target this woman's\ndepressing patterns of making negative comparisons between herself and others. She assumed and really believed, 'Everyone else is happy, I'm not,' 'Everyone else has fun, I don't,' 'Everyone else's life is easy, mine's hard,' and on and on. She virtually never strayed outside her immediate comfort zone to go anywhere interesting or try anything new, and it's fair to say she was exceptionally dull. Simply telling her, 'You know, you assume way too much about things at the expense of actually checking out whether things are as you think they are,' is an intervention that will likely fall flat. She believes herself too easily. So, to make the point more experientially, I instructed her to go to a nearby state park and hike a mountain trail there called the Azalea Glen Springs Trail. Sounds beautiful, doesn't it? Can you picture the fields of beautiful azaleas? Can you imagine the clear mountain springs spilling over the rocky terrain? Well, don't. There are probably four azaleas you see on the hike, and the 'spring' is little more than a metal pipe dripping water out of the side of a hill! This particular client, as part of her depressed mental set, built  things  up  way  beyond  what  they  really  are  in  a  way  that  always  put  her  at  the bottom. In instructing her to hike the trail, I knew she'd imagine flower fields and the springs  as  abundant,  beautiful  and  flowing  water.  I  also  knew  she'd  be  in  for  a  big surprise when she got there after several miles of moderately difficult hiking and found such  a  disappointing  sight.  And,  I  knew  that  when  you  hardly  ever  leave  your  living room, the experience would be dramatic. It was.\nWhen I saw her the day after her hike, she was by far the most animated she'd been since I'd met her. At the start of the hike, she was annoyed with me for telling her to go, and she was annoyed with herself for agreeing to go. She couldn't understand what she could learn on a trail that she couldn't learn more easily in my office. But, she stuck with it, to her credit. When she finally arrived at the Azalea Glen Springs, anticipating all she anticipated finding, at first she was confused. But then she found it very, very funny that after  all  her  hiking  and  high  level  of  expectation  all  she  found  was  a  dripping  pipe coming out of the ground! During her descent she thought very hard about why I would ask her to hike such a disappointing trail. After a while she had the realization that she had set herself up for disappointment by building the springs up into something special in her mind when, in reality, the springs weren't at all the way she had imagined them. She broadened  her  thinking,  and  had  the 'big  aha!' -that  she  is  almost  always  building things up to be better than they really are, and making herself worse than she really is. On the spot, she decided to make greater effort to find out the true value of things from her own direct experience, rather than from assumptions rooted in her insecurity.\nThis  homework assignment provided her a much more intense experience of herself than would my saying to her (in or out of hypnosis), 'You build things up in your mind to be better than they really are and you make yourself out to be worse than you really are so stop doing that!' The hike served a number of therapeutic purposes: It symbolically matched  her  'go  ing  uphill  against  the  world'  feelings,  it  got  her  physically  active  (a great tool in dissipating depression), it caused her to confront her unconscious pattern of maximizing everything and everyone else while minimizing herself, and it boosted her self-esteem  by  giving  her  a  greater  feeling  of  being  in  control  of  herself,  for  she  had\naccomplished something meaningful all by herself.\nAssigning homework or task assignments that will address the client's concerns can take a variety of forms. In addition to the symbolic task described above, another type of assignment can involve 'making the symptom inconvenient' for the person. Typically, a symptom is coddled and catered to, for the client adapts his or her life to its presence. Having the client do something that will make the symptom exceptionally inconvenient can effect a surprisingly rapid and lasting change. It can mobilize resistance against the symptoms themselves (Haley, 1973, 1984).\nFor example, one client I treated indirectly using the approach of making the symptom inconvenient  was  a  girl,  age  nine,  who  refused  to  sleep  in  her  own  bed  because  she wanted  to  be  with  her  parents  in  their  room  at  night  as  they  watched  television. Consequently, she was up late, couldn't get up on time to go to school, and was tired and inattentive much of the time.\nThe girl's parents fought with her to go to bed in her own room, but to no avail. When they consulted me as to what they should do with her, I told them that I did not need to actually see their daughter if they would follow my instructions. I told them to kindly and affectionately send  her  on  frequent  errands after she  had  settled  comfortably  into  their bed: 'Mommy wants a glass of water, will you please go downstairs and get me one?' or 'Daddy  forgot  to  check  the  front  door,  will  you  go  downstairs  and  make  sure  it's locked?' and so forth. Each time she came back and got comfortable, they lovingly sent her somewhere. It took only three nights for her to come to the conclusion that being with mom and dad wasn't so much fun after all, and that she could be a lot more comfortable in her own room!\nHomework assignments  involve  more  dimensions  of  the  person  in  the  therapy  than does  verbal  dialogue  alone.  It  also  allows  the  interventions  to  generalize  to  times  and places outside the clinician's office, allowing changes to be more easily integrated into the  client's  life.  My  tendency  is  to  want  to  avoid  pathologizing  people.  I'd  generally prefer  to  find  a  way  to  help  people  that  focuses  on  what's right with them rather than what's wrong. This is illustrated in my intervention with the girl described above. This was a girl who simply didn't want to miss being with her parents. She's not 'sick.' She just doesn't want to miss anything. But, more traditional interventions might have overtly focused  on  pathological  separation  anxiety,  inadequate  individuation,  dysfunctional family  issues,  parental  double  binds  through  tacit  encouragement  of  the  symptomatic behavior,  and  so  forth.  If  you  think  about  it,  these  very  issues were addressed, though indirectly, and with greater speed and less trauma to her integrity. Homework assignments  can  make  a  point  on  a  variety  of  levels  simultaneously,  both  directly  and indirectly, and when used skillfully are an art form in their own right.",

        "text": "The  meaning  of  an  event  or  a  communication  is  determined  to  a  large  extent  by  the context  in  which  it  appears  (Watzlawick,  Weakland,  &  Fisch,  1974).  For  example,  a single word such as 'no' can actually mean a wide variety of things ranging from a firm, clear 'no' to a wishy-washy 'I don't know' to an affirmative, 'I guess so,' depending on one's tone of voice, body posture dynamics, and the social context.\nChanging the context of a communication changes its meaning and value. A behavior may  be  perfectly  acceptable  in  one  situation,  but  not  in  another.  Consider  the  act  of stealing  as  an  example.  Stealing  money  from  a  blind  beggar  is  an  act  no  one  would condone. Stealing a serum that will cure your mother's terminal cancer from a greedy neighbor who wants a million dollars so you don't have to buy the cure is the same act of stealing, yet it stimulates empathy in most people rather than anger and a desire to punish the offender. Lying by the government to the public is considered a betrayal, unless it's for 'national security.' A man who acts strangely is 'crazy' if he's poor, but 'eccentric' if he's wealthy.\nThe  various  euphemisms  that  abound  in  the  English  language  are  all  simple  and effective 'reframings.' Reframing means changing the meaning by changing the context which  defines  the  way  an  event  is  perceived  (Watzlawick,  1978). Psychotherapy  in whatever  form  it  happens  to  take  at  a  given  moment  necessarily  involves  reframing. Liabilities are turned into assets, traumatic events are converted into learning experiences,  weaknesses  are  turned  into  strengths,  and  so  forth.  Reframing  can  be accomplished  with  a  single  remark,  or  can  involve  a  lengthier,  more  experientially absorbing  hypnotic  experience.  Any  approach  that  encourages  the  client  to  have  a different perspective on the problem involves a reframe. As soon as you say, 'Look at it this way…,' you're attempting a reframe.\nThere  was  a  highly  gifted  speaker  on  the  subject  of  'Love'  that  I  (and  millions  of others) enjoyed named Dr. Leo Buscaglia, whose numerous books all managed to find their way onto the bestseller list. Dr. Buscaglia did a wonderful and emotionally powerful reframe in one of his televised lectures when he somberly observed that each of us human beings has experienced hurt, sadness, and loneliness. He paused dramatically, then burst into a big smile and cheerfully asked, 'Isn't that wonderful?' When he described hurt, sadness  and  loneliness  as  'wonderful,'  it  forced  listeners  to  look  at  those  feelings differently.  He  challenged  us  to  find  a  sensible  basis  for  his  describing  them  so peculiarly.  When we realize, as he intended us to, that it is those negative feelings, as well as positive ones, that unite us all as human beings by allowing us to share common emotions, such feelings can legitimately be viewed as wonderful. I doubt, though, that anyone in Dr. Buscaglia's audience would have thought of sadness as wonderful before his reframe.\nHumor involves reframing as the vehicle for the joke. The punch line inevitably causes us to look at the incidents in the story differently. Consider this joke told to me by one of my clients: A police officer spots an  old,  deteriorated  van driving  down the  street  and notices  it  doesn't  have  license  plates.  Upon  pulling  the  driver  over,  and  walking  up  to him to ask him where his license plates are, the officer notices fifty penguins standing in the  back  of  the  van.  The  officer,  not  expecting  to  see  penguins  in  a  van,  yells  at  the driver: 'I pulled you over because you don't have any license plates, but now I want to know what the heck you're doing with these penguins in your van. No, actually I don't want to know, just take them to the zoo .  You got it, mister? Just take these penguins to the zoo! ' As the van driver pulls away, the police officer shakes his head and mutters to himself 'Well, now I've seen it all.' The very next day while on patrol, the officer sees the  same  van  driving  along  and  decides  to  pull  it  over  again,  this  time  to  address  the license  plate  problem.  When  he  steps  up  to  the  driver's  window,  he  sees  the  fifty\npenguins  still  in  the  van-only  this  time  they  are  all  wearing  sunglasses!  Furious,  the officer says, 'Mister, I thought I told you to take those penguins to the zoo.' The driver's response was, 'Well, I did. And, today, I'm taking them to the beach!'\nHumor softens hard times, gives us emotional distance from despair, and provides us with a means to make something big much smaller and easier to handle. For example, after  the  national  trauma  of  9/11,  how  healing  it  was  to  have  our  comedians  make  us smile again. Reframing through humor made life bearable again.\nThe clinical skill  involved  in  reframing  is  to  suspend  the  client's  self-limiting  belief system long enough for him or her to consider an alternate viewpoint. Turning the 'half empty' glass into a 'half full' one is an obvious example of how a negative viewpoint can be transformed into a positive one. Reframing can work in the other direction, too. An action a client engaged in that he or she felt fine about until the clinician said, 'How could  you  let  yourself  do  that?'  could  rapidly  turn  his  or  her  comfort  into  pain.  Most interventions,  though,  are  intended  to  transform  pain  into  comfort.  The  underlying assumption in doing reframing as an intervention strategy is that every experience (i.e., thought, feeling, behavior) has some positive value somewhere . By taking an experience that  the  client  views  as  a  negative  one  and  commenting  on  how  and  why  that  same experience  might  actually  be  an  asset  to  him  or  her  somewhere,  one  can  change  the client's attitude about that experience, allowing the negativity to be discharged.\nAs  another  example,  a  woman  complained  that  her  husband's  habit  of  snoring  was disturbing her sleep. She was told an emotionally charged story by a widowed friend she happened to complain to. The widow described her loneliness since her husband died, how much she felt the weight of her husband's death on her every experience, and how much she longed to hear her deceased husband's snoring, something she said she'd hated about  him  when  he  was  alive.  The  impact  on  the  woman  complaining  about  her husband's  snoring  was  to  instantly  develop  an  appreciation  for  her  husband's  snoring, because it was clear evidence he was still alive and well. It actually became comforting to her.  Her  husband's  snoring  behavior  was  the  same,  only  her  attitude  about  it  was changed. That's a successful reframe.\nFinding a way to turn a minus into a plus (or vice versa, if appropriate) is a basic part of clinical work. Learning and using the techniques of reframing, with or without formal hypnosis, can make the transformation of a client's personal reality a more efficient and deliberate process.",

        "text": "Symptom prescription is a paradoxical therapeutic strategy which involves the direct or indirect  encouragement  of  the  client's  symptom(s).  When  the  client  is  encouraged  to continue  to  do  what  he  or  she  is  already  doing,  but  in  a  way  that  is  slightly  different through  some  adjustment  requested  by  the  clinician,  the  habitual  symptom  generating sequence is interrupted (Foa & Wilson, 1991). The symptom is no longer a puzzling thing that  'just  happens.'  It  happens  in  response  to  the  clinician's  direction,  only  now  it happens differently, in a way easier to see as both arbitrary and unnecessary rather than as  important  and  inevitable.  Consequently,  symptoms  lose  their  original  meanings  and associations (Haley, 1973; Madanes, 1981, 1984).\nSymptom  prescription,  in  a  sense,  is  a  sort  of  'reverse  psychology'  approach.  For example, in the case of a woman I treated for depression, I prescribed that this woman lie in her bed continuously for four hours a day, specifically in the middle of the day when she was more likely to be active in her daily activities. Lying in bed was something she was  already  doing  as  part  of  her  depression,  but  it  was  at  her  leisure.  I  adjusted  her behavior by instructing her to get up early in the morning, shower, dress, have breakfast, do  a  few  chores,  and  then  go  back  to  bed  for  the  prescribed  four-hour  period.  After following my instructions for several days, she found the bed that was once a haven of comfort was now 'feeling like a prison.' She 'had to' be there, by 'doctor's order.' She reacted very emotionally to her bed, and later pleaded with me to not have to lie in bed anymore. As a final prescription, I instructed her to have a 'leaving bed' party, complete with hats, balloons, cake, and the presence of her family. It symbolized for her a genuine transition, a 'coming out' from her depression, especially when her party 'guests' sat on her bed to be with her. Bed just wasn't the desirable place to be that it once was. As a result, this particular client has been able to actively get on with her life in a very positive way. My symptom prescription strategy encouraged the symptom, made it inconvenient, encouraged a search for better alternatives, and encouraged her to abandon an avoidant behavior that reinforced her depression.\nEncouraging people to do what they are already doing robs their action of spontaneity and  personal  ownership  (i.e.,  it's not 'theirs' anymore).  When  the  pattern  loses spontaneity and personal ownership, it provides no gratification for continuing to engage in  that  behavior.  A  key  to  having  symptom  prescription  work  lies  in  the  rationale  you provide with the prescription. If the rationale doesn't meet the client in his or her frame of reference, he or she will not be likely to follow the prescription. Furthermore, there are multiple dimensions of a presenting problem (its associated feelings, thoughts, behaviors, relational components, symbolic components, etc.) and the symptom prescription must be offered carefully in order to address the appropriate dimension(s). Finally, the modification in the sequence culminating in the symptomatic behavior that the clinician introduces in the prescription is a key element, since it is this modification that will, when used successfully, alter the entire symptom pattern.\nThe potential applications of the symptom prescription paradigm are broad in scope. Encouraging  a  'resistant'  person  to  'be  resistant'  then  redefines  that  resistance  as cooperation. Encouraging a client to have a prescribed relapse redefines a relapse (unless the  client  resists  and  refuses  to  have  one,  which  is  better  yet)  as  an  acceptable  and required part of the treatment process. Encouraging clients to do what they are already doing can give what seems like an uncontrolled symptom some concrete defining limits that make it a little easier for them to be dealt with effectively.",

Metaphor, in the world of hypnosis, has come to mean the use of stories in the treatment process. The use of metaphor is a core component of most  hypnotic  processes.  Building  and  telling  stories as a vehicle for imparting therapeutic messages is a complex and powerful therapeutic skill to develop (B.Erickson,\n2001; Haley, 1973; Rosen, 1982). Therapeutic metaphors can be created in such a way as to parallel the client's problems, and may be told in such a way as to absorb the client in the metaphor. As Australian psychologist and colleague George Burns points out in his excellent book of metaphors, 101 Healing Stories: Using Metaphors in Therapy (2001, Wiley),  the  client  may  project  meanings  into  the  story  that  the  clinician  didn't  even intend to communicate, and these may have greater impact than the intended meanings!\nThe best metaphors are usually those found in the client's own personal experience. Naturally, these are more personal, more immediate, and easier for the client to relate to in a meaningful way. If you take the time to review incidents in the client's life that had special  significance  for  him  or  her,  usually  because  they  taught  him  or  her  something valuable about life, you can have immediate access to a wealth of potentially meaningful metaphors.  Likewise,  your  own  background  and  personal  history  reflect  important learning  experiences,  and  these  may  be  used  as  the  basis  for  therapeutic  metaphors  as well. The more you participate in life, the more experiences you have to draw upon when constructing  therapeutic  metaphors. Cases  you  have  worked  on  or  read  about  that illustrate worthwhile points are also a good source of metaphors. Other sources include storybooks, movies, jokes, anecdotes that illustrate important points about human nature, newspaper stories,  television  programs, and virtually any other  milieu from which you have the opportunity to learn important lessons about living life well from considering other people's experience.\nLearning to tell stories in a hypnotic manner (i.e., meaningfully, in a way that focuses and  absorbs  the  person's  attention,  accepting  and  utilizing  the  client's  responses, embedding suggestions, with an expectancy of the person learning something important, etc.)  is  a  skill  for  doing  hypnosis  that  is  vital  to  develop.  The  necessity  of  formally inducing hypnosis diminishes as the client becomes absorbed in the telling of a story. The natural  ability  of  the  client  to  drift  in  and  out  of  hypnosis  as  he  or  she  listens  to  the clinician  can  be  tapped  and  amplified  by  the  clinician  wanting  to  use  a  metaphorical approach (Brown, 1993).\nMetaphor is obviously an indirect way of suggesting possibilities to the client. Instead of  saying,  'Do  this,'  you  say,  with  exaggerated  simplicity,  'Once  I  had  a  client  who faced a problem similar to yours and one day he tried this and it helped.' The client can be encouraged to learn from others' experiences, whether to apply a specific suggested solution  or,  more  generally,  to  simply  be  willing  to  experiment  with  new  possibilities. The use of metaphor isn't a heavy-handed approach. It is a respectful way of suggesting possibilities  without  demanding  much  from  the  client.  A  common  consequence  of  this approach is that change can sometimes seem relatively effortless, as if it 'just happened,' a  possibility  that  the  clinician  can  allow  for.  Without  offering  magical  interpretations about the wisdom of the unconscious, I can simply say metaphor has a way of stimulating the client's internal associations and directing them toward problem-solving in a way that not  only  makes  sense,  but works .  And,  to  be  sure,  some  changes do take  place  rather 'spontaneously,' with no real internal tug-of-war apparent. For an example out of your own  life,  consider  those  foods  you  hated  as  a  child  that  you  now  enjoy.  These  are probably  not  foods  you  forced  yourself  to  learn  to  like.  Your  tastes  changed,  they evolved-and they changed effortlessly.\nObviously, not all or even most changes take place so effortlessly, making the process\nof therapy uneven in both practice and rate of success. But the therapeutic metaphor as a means  of  imparting  valuable  messages  in  a  memorable  context  (i.e.,  the  drama  of  the storyline) stands a very good chance of facilitating such seemingly spontaneous changes. Spend a day or two just noticing the things that happen in life that illustrate principles of effective living; practice telling people about those events while leading them to discover the  principle  the  story  reveals,  and  you'll  be  well  on  your  way  to  evolving  skills  in designing and delivering therapeutic metaphors.",

        "text": "Some have called this the 'Age of Anxiety,' and there is considerable justification for doing so. The demands placed on each person today in order to live effectively are more numerous and more complex than at any other time in the past. Personal safety, a core issue in anxiety, is uncertain when acts of terrorism can occur at any time in any place. Just as soon as we get used to one technological advance, it becomes obsolete, requiring us to readjust. Traditional values holding society together have been and are continuing to deteriorate, emphasizing individualism and personal gain over social responsibility, and\nmaking even the most important relationships seem only transient. Gender roles are much less specific, and committed marital and family relationships are taking second place to making  strategic  career  moves,  confounding  many  people  trying  to  figure  out  how  to make their relationships work. Finding work and staying employed is a more demanding and  complex  task  than  ever  before  as  people  matter  less  to  companies  than  does  the company's  'bottom  line,'  threatening  economic  security.  The  number  of  potential sources  of  stress  in  our  lives  keeps  growing,  and  most  people  will  struggle  with  these issues to one degree or another at some point in their lives (Regier & Robins, 1991).\nStress and anxiety are inevitable whenever someone faces a circumstance that requires adapting.  Stress  cannot  be  prevented,  only  managed,  because  life  throws  all  kinds  of things at each of us. But, as often as not, stress isn't generated by external circumstances, it's generated by unrealistic expectations (such as perfectionism), a need for things to be orderly and predictable  when too little  of  life  is  that  way,  or  any  of  a  variety  of  ways people  torment  themselves  with  their  own  internal  issues.  Hypnosis  can  be  used  to address  any  and  all  of  these  sorts  of  issues,  teaching  more  realistic  thinking,  greater flexibility, and better problem-solving skills.\nThere  is  one  particular  aspect  of  anxiety  that  bears  special  consideration,  if  only briefly.  It  has  to  do  with  the  foundation  of  anxiety.  There  are  two  separate  but  related structural components of most people's anxiety: The tendency to overestimate the risks one faces, and the tendency to underestimate one's resources or abilities to manage those risks successfully (Barlow, 2000). Thus, teaching people how to more realistically assess the risks they face and how to cope with them skillfully can go a long way in reducing people's  anxiety.  The  reality  is,  no  place  is  truly  safe,  and  many  life  experiences  are inherently  ambiguous,  requiring  us  to  manage  them  skillfully  as  they  arise.  Trusting yourself  to  do  exactly  that,  rather  than  getting  overwhelmed  and  fearful,  is  critical  to keeping anxiety within normal limits. Using hypnosis to teach such critically important skills as risk assessment and personal resourcefulness are vitally important applications.\nHypnosis in its most superficial yet still helpful application in managing anxiety can help one build relaxation skills and an increased sense of self-control. Teaching clients the  skill  of  self-hypnosis  (hypnotic  inductions  and  utilizations  they  can  perform  on themselves  whenever  they'd  like  to)  is  a  necessary  part  of  using  hypnosis  in  clinical contexts.  Simply  knowing  you  have  the  ability  to  relax  deeply  and  reorganize  your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can have a powerful effect in helping you better manage stress and anxiety. Managing anxiety effectively allows for better concentration, clearer thinking  and  problem-solving,  better  self-esteem,  better  time  management,  better  job performance, greater receptivity to new ideas, and better just about everything.",

        "text": "Depression  has  been  a  major  focus  of  my  professional  life,  having  been  my  area  of specialization  in  clinical  practice,  and  the  subject  of  many  of  my  books  (1988,  1989, 1992,  1997,  1999,  2001  a,  2001b),  book  chapters,  articles,  and  clinical  trainings. Depression is a very complex, multidimensional problem that, despite the development of effective psychotherapies and antidepressant medications, continues to grow in prevalence. It is estimated that 20-25 million people in the United States currently suffer\ndepression severe enough to require treatment, yet the majority of them will not receive the  treatment  they  need.  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  recently  declared depression currently the world's fourth most debilitating human condition (behind heart disease,  cancer,  and  traffic  accidents),  and  predicted  that  it  would  grow  to  become  the second most debilitating condition worldwide by the year 2020 (Murray & Lopez, 1997).\nThere  are  numerous  theories  or  models  describing  why  people  get  depressed,  but virtually all of them recognize three primary domains of contributing factors: biological, psychological, and social. In what must be seen as a triumph of marketing over science, the  biology  of  depression  has  been  overstated,  leading  too  many  people  to  believe depression is the result of a shortage of serotonin in the brain which requires medication to  correct.  Given  the  massive  evidence  that  psychological  and  social  factors  are  huge contributors to depression, focusing on neurochemistry alone is too one-dimensional and overly simplistic. It's not wrong-it's just that this view is only a part of the depression story, and not even the greater part of the story.\nStudies of therapeutic efficacy make it clear that active psychotherapy approaches that teach specific skills, especially in clear thinking, effective behavior, and building positive relationships,  match  and,  in  some  ways,  outperform  medications  in  terms  of  both symptom  management  and  relapse  rates  (Antonuccio,  Danton,  &  DeNelsky,  1995). Psychotherapy for depression should be considered an essential aspect of treatment, since no  amount  of  medication  can  teach  coping  skills,  problem-solving  skills,  social  skills, build  a  support  network,  or  do  all  the  other  things  that  are  known  to  not  only  reduce depression but minimize the potential for relapses.  Antide-pressant medications can be valuable, to be sure, but should not generally be considered a sole form of intervention.\nHypnosis can be used in many different ways in treating depressed individuals. Many of  the  possibilities  are  addressed  in  considerable  detail  in  my  books Hypnosis and the Treatment  of  Depressions (1992)  and Treating  Depression  with  Hypnosis (2001  a). Possible targets for intervention might include the depressed person's negative and demotivating expectations (i.e., hopelessness), the perception that no amount of effort will yield  success  (i.e.,  helplessness),  cognitive  distortions,  faulty  attributions,  ineffective behavior, poor social skills, low frustration tolerance, poor coping skills, and any of the other many subjective patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving that can help form and exacerbate depression. Empowerment is a basic theme in treating depression, and in that respect, hypnosis can be an invaluable part of the treatment process.",

        "text": "Considering the fact that the majority of marriages in this country end in divorce, as well as the fact that more people today live alone than ever before, the indication is quite clear that people are having a harder time building and maintaining healthy relationships with others than ever before. Why? There are many reasons: The still-changing roles of men and  women,  the  diversity  of  family  structures  that  might  be  convenient  but  may  not always  best  serve  their  members,  the  increasing  technological  advances  that  keep diminishing our need for contact with others (i.e., more time on the computer than with people),  the  ease  of  divorce,  the  lack  of  good  role  models  teaching  the  skills  good relationships require (consider the role models on trashy television) and the still-casual\nattitudes  about  sex  despite  the  spread  of  herpes,  AIDS,  and  other  sexually  transmitted diseases are just some of the factors affecting each person's ability to relate to another in a positive and balanced way.\nGood relationships  don't  just  happen.  There  is  much,  much  more  to  them  than  just 'good chemistry.' They require nurturing, and a considerable range of skills including empathy, compassion, tolerance, impulse control, problem-solving, negotiation, communication,  self-sacrifice,  and  an  attitude  of  protectiveness  to  name  just  a  few (Gottman, 1999; Weiner-Davis, 2001). In intervening in relationship problems, factors to consider  include  the  quality  of  each  person's  expectations  (a  primary  determinant  of one's level of satisfaction such that when the other person does as you think he or she should you're happier with  him or her), the quality  of  their  communication  skills,  and their  subjective  views  on  issues  like  'power'  and  'intimacy.'  Often,  the  partners  in  a relationship have inadequate communication skills, poorly defined or even inappropriate expectations, more interest in being 'right' than effective, more investment in advancing themselves  than  the  relationship,  and  other  such  barriers  to  building  an  effective relationship.\nWhen  working  with  couples  and  families,  you  are  less  likely  to  employ  formal hypnosis,  although  hypnotizing  one  member  in  front  of  the  others  or  hypnotizing  the whole group can easily be done if you think it an appropriate intervention. Much more likely, however,  is  the  use  of  informal  hypnosis,  using  hypnotic  strategies  (e.g., metaphor, imagery, symptom prescription, or  role  playing)  to  focus  and  absorb  family members on ideas and perspectives you present to them that are meant to empower them to  be  more  effective  in  their  relating  to  one  another  (Haley,  1973;  Kershaw,  1992; Parsons-Fein, 2001; Robles, 2001). Many clinicians will see couples or families as a unit and  then  see  the  members  individually.  Hypnotic  strategies  may  then  be  employed  to clarify  expectations,  increase  the  level  of motivation  to  resolve  differences  respectfully and  skillfully  within  the  relationship,  enhance  communication  skills,  and  address  selflimiting  patterns  that  interfere  with  the  growth  of  the  relationship  (i.e.,  increasing empathy, frustration tolerance, impulse control, etc.).\nEven  when  partners  and  other  family  members  are  not  available  to  do  couples  or family therapy, you  can  still do what  can be called a 'systemically informed' intervention, taking the roles and effects of others into account in the therapy. Healthy relationships serve as a buffer against all kinds of disorders, emotional and physical, and so  are  an  important  consideration  in  multidimensional  treatment.  Using  hypnosis  to enhance the client's relationships can also enhance the therapy.",

        "text": "Your  self-esteem  is  your  subjective  assessment  of  your  value  as  a  human  being.  It  is formed in part  by  the  feedback  we  get  from  others,  but  it  is  formed  to  an  even  larger extent  by  our  beliefs  and  how  they  serve  as  filters  for  the  feedback  we  get.  You  may recall the earlier discussion of cognitive dissonance and its implication for the experiences a person will and will not permit him- or herself (Festinger, 1957). If you think  you're  no  good,  then  other  people  telling  you  that  you  are  good  will  not  likely change your view of yourself. Cognitive dissonance leads you to filter out feedback that\ncon-tradicts your  belief about  yourself, serving as the perceptual mechanism  for maintaining an unfortunate status quo.\nSelf-esteem has been the target of many therapists' interventions. They have believed that  most  problems  stem  from  poor  self-esteem,  and  thus  made  raising  a  client's  selfesteem a primary therapeutic goal. Self-esteem in this regard has been vastly overrated. Self-esteem is a statement as to how you feel about yourself. Good self-esteem doesn't mean you're more socially aware or skilled, or a better more compassionate person, or more skilled in any way. It just means you feel good about yourself. Some of the most seriously disturbed or malicious people (e.g., full-blown sociopaths) on this planet have quite good self-esteem. They are dysfunctional or destructive people who just happen to feel good about themselves.\nHelping people become more skilled is a more expedient path to raising self-esteem, though, than is simply telling people how 'special' they are. I want my clients to be able to  move  through  their  day  being  effective  in  what  they  do,  allowing  them  to  say  to themselves many times during the day, 'I like what I did there. I like the way I handled that.' Self-esteem rises as people develop and notice their skills in living.\nWhen you work with self-esteem issues hypnotically, the client can be encouraged to take control of situations by planning and implementing a deliberate and effective course of action. The person can learn that their problems are not caused by fatal flaws, but by a lack  of  salient  skills,  ones  that  can  be  learned.  Absorbing  the  person  in  learning alternative ways of addressing the issues in his or her life, and solving problems while also  teaching  broader  skills  in  problem-solving,  are  fundamental  components  of  good therapy.  Hypnosis  enhances  skill  acquisition,  encourages  a  willingness  to  try  new behaviors, and empowers people to feel better about themselves as they come to better 'own' the changes they make. Hypnosis can also help the client learn to generalize skills to other areas of his or her life. (For a thorough and practical consideration of self-esteem as a target of intervention, see Andreas, 2002.)",

        "text": "Some of the most serious and pervasive problems in our society today are directly and indirectly related to substance abuse. Excessive use of alcohol and other drugs, cigarette smoking, and overeating are all examples of substance abuse. In each case, the person is experiencing  feelings,  consciously  or  otherwise,  that  are  uncomfortable  (e.g.,  fear, loneliness, boredom, depression, etc.). Instead of dealing with the uncomfortable feelings directly and effectively, the person employs what is known as an 'avoidant coping style.' Avoidance is an inherently disempowering strategy, placing one in the 'victim' position by  saying,  in  essence,  'I  can't  handle  this.'  The  sub-stance  is  turned  to  as  a  way  of altering one's feelings, making them more manageable, even if only for a few moments.\nSubstance abuse also has a strong social component. People build their relationships around  the  substance,  and  perhaps  their  identities  as  well.  Treatment  has  to  be  as multidimensional as the problem. Using hypnosis to teach better problem-solving skills, increase  impulse  control,  resolve  underlying  depression  and/or  anxiety,  enhance  a stronger sense of commitment  to sobriety or abstinence, and many  other such empowering skills are just some of the possible approaches in addressing substance abuse\n(Alman & Lambrou, 1992; Bell-Gadsby, 2001; Levitt, 1993).\nOn a different  level  of  consideration,  substance  abusers  typically  are  in  a  physically dissociated state to some degree, with a markedly diminished awareness of the negative effects of the substance on their bodies. Furthermore, substance abusers gradually build their lives around the substance: Cigarette smokers don't take the stairs, and obese people don't  look  at  their  bodies  in  the  mirror.  Each  wants  to  avoid  situations  that  will  force them to confront (i.e., associate to) the physical effects of their habit, and so dissociation from the body helps to allow the pattern to continue.\nHypnosis can be used to cultivate greater body awareness, a more positive attitude of self-protectiveness, and a greater sense of independence such that whatever situations are encountered can be dealt with more effectively without self-abuse.",

        "text": "Engaging  in  sexual  relations  with  someone  you  love  can  be  one  of  the  nicest  of  all hypnotic  experiences,  wouldn't  you  agree?  Not  for  many  people,  though.  For  them, sexual activity is inhibited or even eliminated because of sexual problems. The various sexual dysfunctions (e.g., erectile dysfunctions, premature ejaculation, disorders of sexual desire, etc.) can occur for a wide variety of reasons, including: (1) misinformation about human anatomy or sexual functioning in general; (2) negative feelings about sex because of past  negative  experiences  with  it,  such  as  guilt  from  a  conservative  religious upbringing or an abusive partner; (3) poor self-esteem and body concept; (4) poor quality relationships  based,  in  part,  on  inappropriate  expectations;  and,  (5)  organic  problems resulting in impaired functioning, as well as other less common reasons (Klein, 2002).\nA thorough physical examination is the first step in dealing with this and all the other problems present that may be organically based. Once the organic reasons for impaired or absent sexual functioning are ruled out, the clinician's task is to assess what psychosocial factors  may  be  causing  and/or  contributing  to  the  sexual  problem(s).  Some  people  can discuss sensitive sexual issues directly, in which case the clinician can also discuss them directly.  But  others  are  embarrassed,  afraid,  or  otherwise  reluctant  to  discuss  delicate matters  directly,  and  so  a  clinician  might  reasonably  decide  to  be  less  direct,  at  least initially, in his or her approach. In such cases, metaphors about other clients' problems can  be  useful  in  helping  diagnose  the  client's  problem  (the  observant  clinician  can observe the ideodynamic changes in response to different parts of the story), as well as in offering therapeutic suggestions and directives.\nPeople with sexual problems are generally in a dissociated state relative to their sexual functioning, rather than being fully associated to the pleasure of the experience (Araoz, 2001). There is a part of them attempting to engage in sexual activity, but their focus may instead be on other parts of themselves that distract or even distress them, such as a part that is observing and criticizing their sexual performance, or perhaps a part remembering past failures with the associated feelings of humiliation, or maybe a part that feels guilty remembering  the  shame  of  their  religious  upbringing,  or  even  a  part  that  simply  feels angry  with  their partner for some  real or imaginary  hurt. The  result is diffuse concentration, mixed feelings, and a discomfort that dissipates the hypnotic aspects of the experience necessary to function well sexually\nHypnosis may be employed to address and resolve past hurts, educate the client about sexual  matters,  and  facilitate  the  process  of  reintegration  so  that  all  of  the  person  may more easily be in the 'here and-now,' more fully experiencing and enjoying the sexual activity (Araoz, 1998). Another type of intervention is even more basic: altering sensory awareness  by  heightening  kinesthetic  sensitivity  hypnotically.  This  is  essentially  an amplified 'sensate-focus' technique that sex therapists routinely employ in the treatment of sexual dysfunction.\nAnxiety  about  sexual  performance  is  a  primary  target  for  hypnotic  interventions  in cases  of  sexual  dysfunction.  Anxiety  causes  poor  performance,  which  causes  more anxiety,  which  escalates  the  probability  of  poor  performance,  and  so  on  in  a  vicious circle. Using the comfort of hypnosis to allow the client to 'let go' is a good model for 'letting go' during sexual activity, which is fundamental to sexual enjoyment. Teaching self-hypnosis  in  order  to  help  the  client  control  anxiety  can  allow  the  relaxation  to generalize to the sexual context where he or she would like to have it.\nReframing  sex  as  a  natural,  healthy  function  is  an  important  suggestion  that  can  be amplified hypnotically in sexual therapy. Giving the paradoxical directive (i.e., symptom prescription)  to  'avoid  sex  at  all  costs  this  week'  can  facilitate  the  'I'll  show  you  by doing it!' attitude in the mildly defiant client (Haley, 1973). Changing personal history to teach a positive attitude toward sex (in the place of a negative one) while growing up is also  a  viable  treatment  strategy.  Age  progressing  the  client  to  see  him-  or  herself  as sexually  active  and  satisfied  is  yet  another  potential  application  of  hypnosis  built  on establishing positive expectancy.\nAs  you  can  probably  tell,  hypnosis  and  sex  therapy  are  two  highly  compatible  and easily  integrated  approaches  to  the  treatment  of  sexual  dysfunction.  Given  how  sexual difficulties can strain even the best of relationships, this is an important area to address if we are to support good marriages and healthy families.",

        "text": "There  has  been  a  clear  distinction  made  between  the  content  (i.e.,  the  details)  and  the structure  (i.e.,  the  form)  of  hypnotic  suggestions.  Similarly,  such  a  distinction  can  be made between the structure and content of a client's problem. For example, someone may have a series of unsuccessful romantic relationships and report that he or she continually gets involved with the same type of 'wrong' person (e.g., each was alcoholic, or abusive, or emotionally distant, or 'wrong' in some other way). Even though the names and faces are different (i.e., the content) from bad relationship to bad relationship, the way (i.e., the structure) the person chooses someone to get involved with remains hurtfully the same.\nShould the clinician focus on the details of each failed individual relationship that the person attempted, and assume the person has some unconscious personal pathology that leads him or her to sabotage relationships? Or, should the therapist acknowledge that the person is motivated to have a relationship (he or she keeps trying despite painful failures) but clearly lacks the relevant skills? Shouldn't the clinician focus on the need to teach relationship  skills,  including  how  to  choose  and  how  to  be  a  healthier  relationship partner?\nI  almost  invariably  choose  those  approaches that  not  only  help  solve  a  problem,  but also teach the process of problem-solving. To do this, spending an inordinate amount of time sifting through all the content-related details of a problem, in this case the client's specific difficulties in each individual failed relationship, is simply not necessary. If you introduce new and more effective ways to address a problem, and make it practical for people to absorb and apply new concepts and methods (e.g., how to make insightful and competent relationship decisions) on a structural level, the content must also change as a direct and predictable consequence.\nWhen  you  think  along  these  lines,  considering how someone  does  something  even more  than what they  do,  it  becomes  possible  to  identify  the  common  structures,  or themes, that repeatedly surface in the problems clinicians are asked to treat. Consider, for example, the range of problems that people can experience when their problem theme is 'letting go.' Learning to 'let go'is a necessity of life. Many things that happen in life are inherently transient in nature, and can't be held onto forever: Your first job is not meant to be your lifelong career, nor is your first 'crush' (i.e., romantic interest) meant to be your lifelong love. Knowing insightfully when and how to 'let go' as a basic life skill permits you to cleanly end one involvement whose time has come to an end in order to begin another.\nFor those individuals who show an impairment of the ability to 'let go,' the symptoms\ncan be quite diverse: staying in a relationship that is pathological or abusive, staying in a job that is unchallenging and unrewarding, smothering a child with overprotection to the point  of  blocking  his  or  her  ability  to  achieve  a  healthy  independence,  compulsively accumulating  unnecessary  or  even  trivial  things  (e.g.,  he  or  she  can't  throw  anything away),  an  inability  to  get  over  a  death  or  relationship  breakup,  and  many  other  such common problems. Thus, while the content of these examples of problems that clients present  may  differ  markedly,  each  shares  a  common  theme  of  the  afflicted  individual having a problem in 'letting go.' It is essential in treatment to teach the client not only to 'let  go'  in  the  immediate  problem  situation at hand, but also to extend the learning of appropriate 'letting go' skills (i.e., clear signs it's time to 'let go,' ways to 'let go') to the  many  other  life  situations  where  the  individual  will  need  that  same  ability.  By extending  the  learning  into  other  contexts,  perhaps  some  that  are  not  yet  problematic, there can be a sophisticated preventative element to the therapeutic intervention.\nIt  is  a  major  decision  point  in  the  therapy  process  as  to  whether  you  would  like  to intervene  on  the  level  of  content,  the  level  of  structure,  or  on  both. In  general, interventions addressing only the content level tend to produce the most transient results. Focusing on content can be useful, but only to the extent that it facilitates rapport and helps identify associated problem structures ripe for intervention.\nTable 18.

This chapter will provide you with a few of them as they relate to particular clients with whom I did hypnosis. As you will note, these hypnotic processes make use of both direct and  indirect  suggestions,  as  well  as  of  all  the  other  suggestion  styles  and  structures identified earlier. They also include the use of therapeutic metaphors, that is, stories I tell",

        "text": "the  client  during  hypnosis.  From  what  you  have  already  learned  about  metaphors  in treatment,  you  know  they  are  meant  to  first  elicit  and  then  guide  the  client's  internal associations in  the  direction of  some therapeutic  goal.  Metaphors as a  form of indirect suggestion can have the multiple functions listed in Table 18 above.\nMetaphors are both engaging and nonthreatening to the client because they are only indirectly  related  to  his  or  her  sensitive  issues;  this  can  make  it  easier  for  the  client  to learn the relevant therapeutic principle(s) in a less emotionally charged atmosphere (see Table 19 below).\nTable 19. Principles of Metaphorical Communication\nMetaphors can be created quite readily when the underlying theme of the presenting problem has been identified. Table 20 below provides some guidelines for the creation of therapeutic metaphors.\nIn general, the metaphors that tend to be the most meaningful to the client are those that  come  directly  out  of  his  or  her  own  experience.  For  example,  teaching  skills  in 'letting  go'  as  a  goal  of  treatment  can  be  made  easier  by  referencing  the  fact  that  the client has previously experienced making a geographic move from one place to another in his or her life. As he or she is oriented to the subject of 'moving' through a metaphor, he or she can be reminded of and focused on the resources associated with moving and 'letting go,' such as how moving involves giving up the known for the unknown, leaving the  past  for  the  future,  how  the  process  of  moving  involves  getting  rid  of  burdensome accumulations  of  items  no  longer  necessary  or  meaningful,  and  so  forth.  Associating those resources to the current problem situation establishes a progressive new emotional framework for moving and 'letting go.'\nPerhaps the easiest metaphors begin with, 'Once I had a client, not unlike you, who…' Such metaphors are encouraging to most clients, who seem to appreciate knowing they are  not  alone  in  their  problems  and  also  that  you  have  previously  successfully  treated similar problems. If the client comes to identify with the person in the story, the positive associations to therapeutic solutions can be more easily established. That is not always the case, however. As I discussed in Treating Depression with Hypnosis (2001), clients",

All the  guidelines  provided  previously  about  suggestion  formulation  must  be  taken  into account. If you launch into a story with a client without carefully evaluating the person's style and demeanor, you could create an avoidable problem for yourself when he or she confronts you about wasting time talking about other people's problems instead of about his or hers! The subsequent loss of rapport can hinder further treatment results.",

        "text": "I  have  repeatedly  emphasized  throughout  this  book  that  the  effective  use  of  clinical hypnosis  involves  tailoring  your  approach  to  the  unique  characteristics  of  each  client. However, I also recognize the value of modeling as a teaching tool. So, the remainder of this chapter contains some samples of hypnosis sessions that may serve to help you more easily integrate all the information about hypnosis contained in this book. The following session transcripts  are  derived  from  hypnosis  sessions  done  with  actual  clients  seeking help for a variety of problems. I hope you will study them with a deep consideration of the  personal,  interpersonal,  and  contextual  variables  that  led  to  the  creation  of  the\ntherapeutic suggestions made. You will be given some background on each of the clients, an explanation as to the goal(s) for that particular hypnosis session, and how the session relates to the larger goal(s) for the client's therapy.\nAs  a  final  point  regarding  these  sample  transcripts,  I  have  chosen  to  present  in  this chapter only those things that I said to the client in order to illustrate the various forms hypnotic  suggestions  may  take.  In  reading  the  following  transcripts,  your  learning  of hypnotic patterns can be enhanced by actively considering the suggestions offered and reasoning  out  the  rationale  for  their  inclusion.  In  contrast  to  the  one-sided  hypnosis presented in this chapter, the next chapter contains The Case of Vicki, a complete session transcript with commentary and analysis for a woman with terminal cancer seeking pain relief  through  hypnosis.  That  session  provides  a  fuller  representation  of  how  doing clinical hypnosis is a cooperative, interactional, and individualized process.\nOne other note: These sessions are timeless in almost all ways but one: I used to use the  terms  'hypnosis'  and  'trance'  interchangeably,  and  so  I  frequently  referred  to 'trance'  responses  in  the  course  of  these  sessions.  As  you  know,  I  have  subsequently dropped the use of the word 'trance' in my sessions and writings, simply because it is too vague a term and now strikes me as even being too esoteric as we accumulate more data about the hypnotic experience. (Change happens…) So, feel free to substitute the word 'hypnosis' for 'trance' in your mind as you read these transcripts.",

        "text": "The client is a woman in her early sixties who initially sought treatment for nightmares, recurring traumatic images associated with childhood episodes of molestation, poor selfesteem,  and  an  inability  to  effectively  set  limits  in  her  relationships  with  others. Supporting  her  working  through  the  feelings  associated  with  her  traumas  was  one obvious and necessary part of her treatment plan. Another part of her therapy focused on her  lack  of  a  sense  of  Self-what  many  clinicians  call  a  lack  of  'ego  boundaries.' Assertiveness  and  limit-setting  capabilities  are  possible  to  achieve  later  in  a  therapy sequence, after  sense  of  a  Self  is  first  defined.  This  woman  was  so  global  in  her  selfunderstanding  and  so  adaptive  to  whomever  was  around  her  that  she  knew  very  little about  her  own  thoughts  and  feelings.  The  following  transcript  represents  part  of  one hypnosis session conducted quite early in her therapy addressing the theme of building boundaries and evolving a clearer definition of Self.\nAll  right,  Molly,  you  can  begin  by  taking  in  a  few  deep…relaxing  breaths… getting  yourself  comfortable…getting  yourself  oriented  now…to  enter  into internal  experience  for  a  while…so  that  you  can  really  enjoy  the  balance between conscious awareness and unconscious awareness…let each breath relax you…let your thoughts run loose for a while…until they tire themselves out… and then little by little, they can slow…becoming very slow…so that more and more  of  your  mental  energy  can  be  spent  on  learning…at  the  deepest  levels within yourself…of the experience of comfort…about the experience of being\nso distant…from all the usual focal points of your awareness…so that you really can  know  deeply…that  all  the  inner  terrain…your  inner  landscape…can  be traveled comfortably…looking  at  this  natural formation…and  that  natural formation…the feelings and thoughts…the historical markers…your curiosity… and  a  very  deep  recognition…of  inner  capabilities…and  it's  interesting  to observe  the  evolution…what  the  experience  of  development  is  like…to  see  a newly born baby…and no one really knows whether the baby thinks or what the baby thinks…and to watch an infant discover its own fingers, its own toes…to see the amused look on an infant's face…when it discovers that it can make a finger  wiggle…at  will…and  little  by  little…that  infant  learns…this  is my body…and it is separate and distinct from any other part of the world…from all other  people  and  places  and  things…and  each  square  inch  of  your  skin…is  a boundary…between your inner world…and the outer world…and it really isn't possible  for  you  to  jump  out  of  your  skin…you  are self-contained …and  it's interesting…that  there  are  some  people  who  don't  have  a  home  in  which  to live…who believe that the sky is their roof…that the earth is their home…and then there are others who mark off huge territories, acres of land…they clearly mark that it is theirs…and each wall…keeps something in and keeps something out…and there are walls of stone…walls of wood…steel-reinforced walls…and there are the walls…that you can build for yourself…deliberately and happily… that  are  permeable  walls…the  kind  that  can  selectively  let  things  in  and  let things out…and it's that kind of a wall…that allows just enough distance from discomfort…to be able to drive down a freeway…comfortably…it is the kind of permeable wall…that when someone makes a comment during a conversation . . . that perhaps  you  can  relate  to…that  permits  a  comfortable  distance…a protective…distance from which to consider each bit of input…and you can feel secure  that  each  person's  feedback  to  you  will  have  to  check  in  at  your  front gate…before you decide to let it in or not…before you decide whether to react or not…and if you react…to decide how you'll react…based on what works… and  feels  good  at  the  deepest  levels  within  yourself…so,  why  not  have  a construction  party?…and  build  a  pretty  wall…and  a  creative  wall…and  I wonder what colors you'll use…what materials you'll use…and what does the check-in gate look like?…and how very much room is there…for lots and lots of growth…and the walls…can always be moved when you so desire…they can be built  up  or  built  down…you can put in peep holes and panoramic windows… after all, the walls are yours…and all I know is that the ability…to walk into an open  space…has  at  one  level…unlimited  freedom…but  at  another  level… where's  the  structure  to  guide  experience  meaningfully?…and  when  I  moved into this particular office that I'm in now…it was a huge space… I had to draft a plan…detailing  how  many  walls  I  wanted…and  where  I  wanted  them…how many outlets…and how many doors…and did I want the doors opening in or opening  out…how  many  'on'  switches  and  how  many  'off'  switches…and there's a part of you that knows very well…that designing uses for space…is a real art…and you discovered over time…that each part of you…all the parts of you…have  some  space…and  how  you  want  to  use  that  space…is  certainly  a\nmatter of individual design…and the aesthetics…of a high wall here, or a low wall there…more space for this part and less space for that part…and you can really enjoy…the  incredible clarity…that comes  along…with  increasingly sophisticated  designs…movable  and  removable  walls…and  what  a  relief  to know…that nothing that you experience need necessarily flow right through all of  you…that  you  have  lots  of inner  protection …walls of inner  strength …and you've  seen  pictures  of  the  Great  Wall  of  China…and  you've  heard  of  the Wailing  Wall…and  you've  read  about  the  Berlin  Wall…and  you  know  about Wall Street…and maybe you've even heard about Wall Drug, South Dakota… and the natural wall of the Rocky Mountains…the sheer cliff walls of La Jolla… and  with  all  the  different  possibilities…your  unconscious  mind  can…without any real effort on your part…it can plan…and build…and if you were to work for the Border Patrol…you'd really know about the importance of enforcing and protecting the walls that separate inner from outer…twenty-four hours a day… seven days a week…one really must protect one's borders…and there are a lot of deeper meanings…that I really know…you can absorb and use…a day at a time…and so take your time…to process…to architect…and then…when you feel  like  you  want  to…and  when  you're  ready  to…that's  when  you  can  reorient…and open your eyes when you are ready….\nMultiple sessions were conducted with Molly emphasizing inner awareness, the recognition and acceptance of her own uniqueness, the ability to make positive choices in her own behalf, and the ability to deal with past traumas so as to permit future growth.",

        "text": "The  client  is  a  woman  in  her  late  thirties  who  suffers  chronic  pain  in  her  neck  and shoulders, a consequence of a car accident in which she was rear-ended while stopped at a red light. She had several neurological evaluations prior to consulting me, and was told that  the  pain would most likely eventually diminish, though not in the near future. The client  is  a  professional  woman  who,  as  a  result  of  her  injuries  and  residual  pain,  is currently unable to work. She is married, and in all other respects is a high functioning, competent  woman.  She  did  not  evidence  depression  or  anxiety  beyond  what  would  be considered normal for her circumstances. Thus, other than instructing her in the use of dissociative techniques of hypnotic pain management over the course of a few sessions, further therapy was deemed unnecessary. The following transcript was from the fourth of five sessions.\n… Okay, Madeline… Are you comfortable? …(Nods)… Good…you can begin by taking in a few deep, relaxing breaths…and then whenever you're ready… you  can  just  allow  your  eyes  to  close…so  that  you  can  begin  now…to  go inside…to be able to  explore  within  yourself…find  those  most  comfortable… thoughts…and  feelings…that  can  allow  you  that  very,  very  relaxed  state…of mind  and  body…and  you  might  remember…that  you've  experienced  trance\nwith  me  before…and  so  I  know  from  at  least  those  experiences…as  well  as other trance experiences you've had…both on your own and with others…that you know  from  your  own  direct experience…what  it's like to breathe comfortably …and to sit comfortably …what it's like to get so absorbed in your own thoughts…that for a little while you forget…that the rest of the world is going  about…its  usual  business…and  one  of  the  most  soothing,  relaxing recognitions…is that you really don't have to pay attention…to anything other than what pleases you for the moment…and the nature of the conscious mind is such…that  it  will  naturally  drift…from  here  to  there…and  to  nowhere  in particular…and wherever your conscious mind drifts to at any moment…is just fine…whether you notice the routine sounds of the environment…or your own thoughts…or  your  own  reactions  to  the  different  things  that  I  say…or the changes  that  take  place  in  your  body …as  your  mind  drifts…to  the  different awarenesses…and it can be very comforting to know…that that is the nature of the conscious mind…it can drift in…and out…it can notice and not notice…it can think and enjoy not having to think…or having to analyze critically…and so it can accept easily…the different possibilities…and while your conscious mind is  certainly  capable  of  processing…whatever  it  happens to notice…the part of you that is infinitely…more interesting and powerful is your unconscious…the part of you that can listen…and respond…even when your conscious mind drifts elsewhere…and your own unconscious mind…has abilities that your conscious mind sometimes forgets about…and when you're conscious of your unconscious mind's  abilities…and  can  consciously  analyze  and  access…the  unconscious awareness…of what your conscious mind knows and doesn't know…and what's easier  to  understand  consciously  than  unconsciously…that's  when  you  can appreciate the comfort of recognizing…how the mind and the body…can work so closely together sometimes…when that's important…and how other times… the conscious mind and the unconscious mind…can drift off elsewhere…and the mind's greatest ability is the freedom…to go wherever imagination wills it…and some  people  like  the  freedom  of  having  their  minds  float  through  space  and through time…others like to drift back in time to the comfort…of a very special soothing  place…that's  prominent  in  their  memory…and  is  vivid  in  their senses…and the fact that your mind can drift off …way over there…while your body rests …over here…is certainly an interesting experience…and sometimes people forget…how when their mind is drifting there…and their body is resting here…that  their  body  can  continue…to  take  care  of  itself…the  automatic, unconscious…self-preserving…nature  of  your  body  over  here…can  give  your mind  the  comfort  over  there…that  allows  a  comfortable  distance…that  gives you the freedom to simply know how differently…you can feel…and when your mind drifts…that's when it's easy to not notice things that change…and I don't know whether you know that your breathing has changed…that your pulse rate has  changed…and  what  it  feels  like  to  have…your  body  somewhere…close enough…to  use  if  you  want  it  or  need  it…but  without  impinging  on  the freedom…to float freely and comfortably…that light…airy feeling…and as you experience  that  interesting  sensation…it  can  be  very  interesting  to  discover…\nhow easy it is to forget…to notice where your left foot is relative to your right… until I draw your attention to it…what it feels like to wear a wristwatch on your left  wrist…it's  easy  to  forget…what  it  feels  like  …to  have  earrings  in  your ears…or to have the chair supporting  your  body  comfortably…and  you  know and I know…that the mind and body…are closely related…and so are thoughts and feelings…and so is past and present…but you're also very aware that things change…and that awareness offers…a buffer…a comfort zone…that leaves just enough room between the present and the past…to make the present of comfort a gift that you can enjoy for months to come…and the comfort zone…between the present and the future…where the present can be just comfortable enough… to  allow  a  future  of  feeling  better…a  day  at  a  time…and  you  know  that sometimes…people don't understand the relationship between past and present…anymore than they understand the relationship…between thoughts and feelings…but you have a feeling that your thoughts matter…and your thoughts about your feelings can allow your feelings some distance…a safe, comfortable distance…between what you experience now and what you felt then…and what you're going to think tomorrow…but you'll have to wait until tomorrow…for your conscious mind to know…what your unconscious has already discovered…that it takes far more effort than it's worth…to move your hand… when it's so much easier… you can be so much more comfortable sitting beside yourself so much more comfortably …when your mind is here…and your body is here…and it's just enough distance to be so much more comfortable than you thought you  could be …and  you  can  be  very  aware…of  that  interesting sensation…of being separate from your body…and having all of yourself…in the experience of deep trance…and you know and I know that as distant as your body  feels  on  one  level…it  also  feels  close  enough  on  another  level…to  be aware of its need to continue to breathe…in…and slowly out…so effortlessly… and so comfortably…and as your mind continues to float there…and your body continues to rest comfortably over here…your conscious mind can certainly be curious…about the comfortable sensations of feeling the separation existing … and you don't really have to analyze too carefully which part of you is the most comfortable at the moment…you can simply allow yourself instead…to enjoy the  comfort  that  goes  along…without  really  being  sure…exactly…where  your fingers are…or where your hair is…it can be very soothing to know that you can drift back…into an awareness of your body when you choose to…and that for the moment…you can simply enjoy the choice…of letting your mind be there… while  your  body  rests  comfortably  over  here…and  I  know  that  doesn't  make much  sense  to  your  conscious  mind…but  fortunately…even  though  your conscious mind is very smart…your unconscious mind is a lot smarter than you are…and all the learnings of your lifetime…allow you the comfortable position now of  being able to drift freely…far enough away…yet close enough to your body…to be so comfortable…in ways your conscious mind is only beginning to discover…and each time that you listen  to  this  tape  or  each  time  that  you  sit quietly  with  your  eyes  closed…your  unconscious  mind  can  add  a  new  and interesting  dimension  to  the  experience…your  overall  awareness…of  your\nability to be as close to or as far away from…your body as you'd like to be… and when you recognize…powerfully within yourself…how much more control you  have  than  you  ever  thought  possible…then you  can  enjoy  the  feeling  of comfort …that  you  really  can  rest  comfortably…and  that  you  really  can  heal surprisingly quickly…now that more parts of you have begun some work on the job…and so, Madeline… I'd like you to take your time…and reorient yourself to whatever degree that you wish to… in order to bring…yourself out of trance to  whatever degree you wish…and by that, I mean that if you choose to keep your body in trance while you bring your mind out of trance… I can certainly understand that choice…or if you choose to bring your body out of trance…but leave the comfort intact to enjoy the rest of the day… I can certainly understand that  choice…and  whatever  choice  you  make…you'll  certainly  be  aware…that when you allow your eyes to open…you'll be ready to get on with the rest of today  in  a  much  more  comfortable  state  of  mind  and  body…and  that  will certainly be an eye-opening experience….\nThe  suggestion  of  being  able  to  keep  her  body  comfortably  in  hypnosis  while  in  a 'waking' state  was  one  that  Madeline  found  especially  useful  in  helping  her  carry  out routine  activities.  The  many  suggestions  throughout  for  disorientation  and  dissociation (mind and body, conscious and unconscious, past and present, and body parts) facilitated a very deep experience of hypnosis that permitted substantial relief from pain during her lengthy recovery.",

        "text": "The client is a man in his late fifties who presented the problems of 'being stuck' in an unstable  'on-again,  off-again'  relationship  that  he  finds  distressing,  having  high  blood pressure,  and  procrastinating  around  issues  of  his  career.  He  presented  as  'wanting  to achieve enough personal growth to be able to move forward with my life.' He did not have  any  specific  goals  in  mind  as  to  what  would  represent  'moving  forward.'  If  the client's  goal  isn't  well-defined and if there  aren't specific steps to follow to achieve it, then it isn't a goal. It's only a wish. Thus, one goal in this client's treatment was to help him evolve a clear sense of direction in his life. During the course of treatment, hypnosis was  utilized  to  encourage  the  development  of  a  clear  and  specific  sense  of  the  future, enough to compel him to take some decisive courses of action in the present. The client is an educator who claimed to be well acquainted with clinical hypnosis in general and the work  of  Milton  Erickson  in  particular.  This  transcript  is  from  the  third  of  a  dozen sessions.\n… Okay Jerry, you can begin by taking in a few deep, relaxing breaths…and little by  little…you  can  let the various recollections…drift through  your awareness…of what it's like to be in deep trance…in a way that's pleasing and comfortable…and it's been quite a while…since you last experienced…al trance process…with me as guide…but there was a time…not all that long ago…when\nyou  first  became  accustomed…to  hearing  my  voice…get  quieter…to  hearing me…speak  in  a  very  slow…deliberate  way…and  it  was  during  that  initial experience…when you were first beginning to learn something about trance… and  were  open  to  much  deeper  possibilities…that  you  allowed  yourself  to experience…some of the most interesting dimensions…of doing trancework… and since quite some time from our first trance has elapsed…and since you've grown in so many ways since…it can certainly be much easier…to drift into a deeper trance …and a much more comfortable state of mind and body…moment by  moment…and  this  is  one…very  worthwhile  opportunity…to  rediscover… your ability…to drift…in a way that's useful…in a way that's meaningful…and I  know…that  the  various  possibilities…as  you  explore  your  experiences…can certainly be most intriguing…as the various possibilities…allow you to rediscover…old awarenesses…that pave the way for new awarenesses…and as the new awarenesses drift…into your consciousness…that's when it's so easy… to discover how little attention…is necessary…to allow all kinds of comfort… that  we can build upon…in a future experience…of each day…and I'm aware that  your  mind  is  drifting…to  nowhere  in  particular…that  the  things  that  you think about at this moment…are  tied…to past experiences…and future expectations…and you know and I know…that so often…if the seed…can get planted today…it generates the greatest amount…of worthwhile…future possibilities…and  as  Erickson  correctly  pointed  out…you  can't  change  the patient's  past…you can only change his perspective of it…and how much the past  relates  to  your  future…you'll  presently  come  to  know…because  it's  the present that is connected to your past…and leads to your future possibilities… that you're willing to explore…and your presence here…confirms that…as you make  yourself  the  present…of  a  positive  future…that  wisely  incorporates learnings of the past…of things that you experience presently…and all that talk about  past  and  present  and  future…isn't  really  meant  to  disorient  you  in  any way…that might be worthwhile…but it certainly can help you…in seeing the perspective…that the impulses of the moment… can be looked at differently… as you discover…that the most worthwhile things to be made…you can make on the inside…from within…in your deep self…your deep self…and if you think back…through the worthwhile things that you've already experienced…few of them  came  easily…for  the  simple  reason…that  whatever  you've  obtained… you've worked for…and there were so many times…on your way to becoming a teacher…that it would have been so much easier…to skip class…and go play… to  go  to  the  beach…or  to  go  for  a  run…and  you  certainly  would  have  been justified in doing so…but you felt deeply…there was something more important to  be  gained…in  the  name  of  sacrifice…and  every  self-sacrifice  for  selfimprovement  really  isn't  much  of  a  self-sacrifice…because  when  you  think about the relationship between sacrifices and improvements…and you improve the  sacrifice…and  you  sacrifice  more  than  you  improve…you  really  haven't sacrificed…you've just improved…and gone a step further…and the questions from  within…that  generate  the  momentum  to  grow…and  experience…is  a dwindling  internal  pressure…that  each  experience  can  comfort…each  new\nopportunity…for growth…can be recognized for what is…and there's been so much that you've learned over time…so many ways that you've changed…and as  each  change  equalizes  the  pressures  outside…by  responding  deeply  to  the appropriate  demands  from  inside…you've  become  so  skilled…and  the  results have  shown…and  you  can  have  a  very  powerful  impact…when  you  allow yourself…to  release…maybe  to  teach…in  a  sharing  way…what  you  already know…and going to school is only one way…to evolve…and change…in a selfsacrificing  way…that  leads  to  a  greater  sense  of  self…than  anything  you've experienced before…and all through your past…there was self-sacrificing…that had an aura…of taking care of yourself…beneath them…and when one becomes a parent…it's  apparent…that  the  selflessness  of  parenthood…is  the  shiny surface…of  a  selfish  decision…to  have  children…that  one  hopes  will  reflect one's self…with pride…and accomplishment…and the debate about the selfish nature of the selfish decision to have children…continues…and the sacrifice… of a loving relationship…that gives you what you want…and you know what it means to give…in order to get…and whatever you may have to openly give… grows…easily…and  as  you  understand  more  and  more  deeply  within…that giving  to  get…is  the  greatest  way…to  build  a  solid  relationship…especially with  yourself…especially…with  yourself…  and  so…why  not…selfishly  and selflessly…sacrifice a little bit of time each day…to give to yourself…in order to  get  from  yourself…a  much  more  comfortable…and much less  pressured … way of doing things…a much less pressured …way of circulating blood…in a body that's so healthy…with comfort…and the ability to relax deeply…and you know from the people that you work with…that you can pretend that they're not listening…but you know that their unconscious mind is…and they can pretend they're not listening…but don't you be fooled by it…because there's a part of each  person…no  matter  how  educated  or  otherwise…that  has  the  ability  to learn…and to grow…and to change…and someone can work hard at staying the same…but you know and I know that change is inevitable …and so don't you be fooled  by  it…and  I'm  going  to  be  silent  for  a  minute…as  you  explore  within yourself…the  thoughts  and  feelings…that  pass  through  your  awareness…that become  significant  for  you  in  ways  that  your  conscious  mind  has  yet  to discover…and when I again speak to you in a minute…my voice can just relax you even more deeply…and the minute of silence begins…now…(one minute of silence)…that's right…you can just continue to relax…to continue to be at ease and resting comfortably…and you've allowed me to be aware…of the multiple purposes of our session…learning opportunities and personal growth opportunities…professional growth…and meaningful experiences…and I wonder how much you'll be able to discover…from these trance experiences… as  you  notice  the  different  ideas  and  the  different  perspectives…and  you  can enjoy  knowing…that  each  trance  process…will  have  a  different  effect…and generate a different pattern…in ways that your unconscious mind…can allow… while  your  conscious  mind  looks  forward…to  discovering…the  range  of possibilities…a  day  at  a  time…and  so,  take  what  ever  time  you'd  like  to…to process  your  thoughts…the  different  dimensions  of  your  experience…and  to",

        "text": "The  following  transcript  is  of  a  hypnosis  session  conducted  with  a  psychologist  in  his mid-fifties  attending  one  of  my  clinical  hypnosis  training  courses.  While  he  found  the concepts  and  techniques  of  clinical  hypnosis  highly  illuminating  as  a  model  for  better understanding  people's  subjective  experience  relative  to  psychotherapy,  he  was  having difficulty shifting his perspectives about doing therapy away  from his previous psychodynamic model. During a demonstration session in the training, he asked to have a hypnosis  session  to  help  him  better  assimilate  the  new  learnings  and  to  evolve  greater flexibility in his treatment approaches. Thus, this session was done before the other class members in a context defined more as educational than clinical. It was the first and only time I worked with this man.\n… Ben,  you  can  arrange  yourself  in  the  most  comfortable  of  positions…and then a little at a time…you can orient yourself to the possibility…of being very relaxed…very  comfortable…very  much  at  ease  within  yourself…and  I  know that it was Ernest Hilgard…who formulated the idea…that a person's ability to be  hypnotized…to  go  into  deep  trance…was  a  fixed  characteristic…one  that really wouldn't change much  over time…and  I  wonder  whether you're discovering…a good and satisfying basis for disagreeing with Hilgard…perhaps discovering  that people  can  go  into  deeper  trances …reaching  deeper  levels more quickly…through practice…through experience…and you may be interested  in  knowing…just  how deeply  into  trance you  can  go…or  just  how quickly  you  can  reach…a  very  comfortable  level…within  yourself…it  really doesn't matter much…whether you focus on depth…or speed…or Hilgard…or yourself…all  that  really  matters…is  the  enjoyment  that  goes  along…with discovering that at all levels within yourself… that you really can be comfortable …and  I  know  that  it's  important  to  you  to  have  your  mind  be active…to  think  and  to  analyze…and  to  always  be  oriented…to  as  much  as what's going on around you as you can…that's the pattern…that you've evolved\nthrough  a  lifetime  of  learning…and  you  know  and  I  know…as  mental  health professionals…that sometimes people are the masters of what they learn…and other times…people are the victims of what they learn…and each time that you take  time  to  learn  something  new…  chance…to  integrate  it  with  what  you already  know…deeply…and I don't  know  how  much  you  know…about  what you  know…about  what  Milton  Erickson  knew…about  what  he  knows…and how people know what they know…on't know about what they don't know… and  a  famous  humorist  once  said…it's  not  what  you  don't  know…that's  the problem…it's what you know that ain't so…and Milton Erickson…a gentlemen that  you're  by  now  familiar  with…didn't  really  believe  in  formal  theories  of personality…  Milton  wouldn't  be  the  one  to  describe  your  patterns  as… obsessive  or  compulsive…he  wouldn't  be  the  one  to  label  a  person  with  a particular  name…and  yet…some  people  insist  on  doing  exactly  that…and  I worked in a hospital long enough…to know…that doctors will say…how's the broken  leg  in  room  210?…how's  the  manic  in  room  325?…where's  the depressive  in  room  104?…as  if  no  one  has  a  name  anymore…no  one  is  a person…just a label…and it was Erickson's belief system…and I wonder just what  you  think…deeply…in  reaction  to  Erickson's  observation…that  while your unconscious mind has…ample resources that can be used to help facilitate changes…in  yourself  and  in  others…it's  the  learned  limitations…the  learned limitations…that  reinforce  what  Erickson  referred  to  as  rigidity…of  patterned behavior…that  a  person  learns  a  certain  sequence…a  certain  style…a  certain response pattern…and then that's what he does over and over again…in a very rigid  sort  of  way…and  when  you  suggest  a  deviation  from  that  pattern…you may  get  resistance…and  when  you  suggest  that  someone  step  outside…the boundaries of his patterns…you may get resistance…and it isn't until someone breaks  his  own  pattern…by  responding  to  the  same  old  situation…in  a  new way…that  the  most  mean-ingful  changes  occur…and  there  are  rigid  thought patterns…rigid emotional patterns…rigid behavioral patterns…rigid social patterns…rigid  therapy  patterns…mically  speaking…stereotyped  responses  in specific situations…and why not step outside…the usual boundaries…why not demand  a  new  response  from  yourself  in  an  old  situation…why  not  do something differently…and enjoy the new results…and enjoy discovering…that you really can beflexible enough… to respond differently …in ways that are only first being discovered…by your conscious mind…and I wonder how many new things  you  can  do  today…and  how  many  out  of  character  responses  you  can generate today…and can you be flexible enough…to respond differently…and when  your  usual  level  of  tension  gives  way  to  the  deep  relaxation  you  have now…that's  a  change  in  pattern…and  when  discomfort  becomes  comfort… that's  a  change,  also…and  little  by  little…you're  beginning  to  discover…new possibilities in old situations…in ways that can feel so good…on all levels…and why not…allow yourself…a different response…in that situation where it would be most helpful…and least restrictive…opening the door to new possibilities… and closing the door…on outdated learnings…a day at a time…and so take your time…process the part of my message that your conscious mind can\nunderstand…safely…and  pretend  that  there  aren't  any  deeper  meanings…for your unconscious to learn…and then when you feel like you're ready to…and want  to  re-orient  to  here  and  now…you  can  begin  that  process…of  bringing yourself…to a different level of responses…and when you're ready to…you can just allow your eyes to open….\nAfter  the  hypnosis  session,  the  demonstration  subject  reported  being  aware  of  an important reframing that had taken place for him during the session. He claimed he had not thought of his therapy approaches as 'rigid.' Rather, he had simply thought of them as 'proper procedure.' In hearing his patterns described as 'stereotyped responses' and absorbing the idea that growth comes from 'stepping outside the usual boundaries,' he reported feeling a freedom to experiment he had not previously felt. Over the course of the remaining days in the course, he commented several times on the 'liberating effect of having more ways to conduct therapy.'",

        "text": "The client  is  a  woman  in  her  early  forties,  employed  as  a  computer  programmer,  who presented  the  concern  of  wanting  to  maintain  the  weight  loss  she  had  succeeded  in obtaining through a program she participated in. She had been able to gain control over all of her dysfunctional  eating  habits, with  the exception  of  snacking  on  bread, particularly French sourdough baguettes. She wanted to be able to develop moderation in her bread in-take, much as she had with the other foods in her diet. She is a woman who values  logic,  and  has  a  long  history  of  being  fairly  dissociated  from  her  feelings.  This transcript represents the second of three sessions.\n… All right Gerda,…you can take in a few deep, relaxing breaths…and orient yourself now to inner experience for a while…somewhere…a little deeper than rationality…somewhere  beneath…logic…somewhere  to  the  right  of  your  left brain…somewhere  above…everyday  living…and  when  you're above and below…the right  of  things  that  are  left…then  every  direction  provides  a  new opportunity  or  deeper  sense…of  comfort…  and  for  a  very  long  time…you've had  many  experiences  of  being  able  to  think  rationally…to  relate  at  a  deeper level…to the logic of computers… the sequencing of programs…all exercises… for the intellect…but you know and I know…that the true balance of things… rests…on  continuous  movements…continuous  minor  adjustments…in  daily experiences…that  move  us  from  balance  to  imbalance…back  to  balance… hoping  and  adjusting…and  all  of  that…about imbalance  is  very  heavy …and balance  is  light…red  light…blue  light…white  light…  light  feelings…light beer…light air…light thoughts…and what makes something that's heavier than air…float…and which part of your body is lighter? …left side…or right side… top half…or bottom half…the front of your back…the back of your front…you really don't know…but when you experience…the kind of uplifting experience…that really raises your awareness…for how distant one part of you\ncan  seem…while  another  part  seems  to  float…right  in  front  of  you…and  if thoughts  are  over  here…and  feelings  are  over  there…then  you  might…be oriented to a disorienting experience…and whether it's temporal disorientation or  physical  disorientation…being  oriented  to  how  disoriented  your  body  can be…then  you're  oriented  to  thought…and  have  you  noticed  how  disoriented your thoughts can be when you're so oriented to your body …and it can seem so close and yet so far…and you can think you understand and that you know what you hear…but if you don't know what you hear when you're here then maybe you  know  what  is  there…and  when  you  play…that  light…carefree  feeling returns…and your thoughts can smile…and what a sensation when your body giggles…and which part…experiences humor? and what about…being disoriented to the usual cues…the usual patterns…that you'd really like to scale down…and lightening  up allows  for  that  possibility…and  remember  once  I described that the ocean has the ability to maintain itself…and at a much deeper level…your  unconscious  is  learning  nature's  way  of  maintaining  a  body…of water…and  how  much  of  the  body  is  water?…and  you  know  when  there's chemistry…which molecule…and which atoms…have a natural attraction…and what is the chemical makeup…of sourdough bread in comparison to rye?…and when  they  bag  it  (baguette)…to  take  it  home…any  change  in  your  deeper structure provides an interesting opportunity for growth…and that's an awful lot to digest…in one sitting… but when the conscious mind is overloaded…that's when the unconscious gets to enjoy the spotlight for a while…and that's when it can really shine…and I don't know if anybody really knows why that's true…all I know is…you have a conscious mind…that's very smart…and an unconscious mind…that's even smarter…and I remember…a colleague of mine named Jeff Zeig telling me once…that Erickson told him once…that variety…is the spice… of  life…but  he  said  it  a  little  differently…he  sat  Jeff  down…and  he  said  that each person enjoys meals differently…some really enjoy seven course dinners… and  which  course  is  the  right  first  course?…some  enjoy  soup…followed  by salad…some prefer it the other way around…and one might enjoy…something to cleanse their palate with…and which side dish goes with which main dish?… and  I  knew  one  individual  who  enjoyed  dessert  first…which  I  thought  was  a very heavy decision to make…but with each person there are differences…and Erickson droned on and on describing… how many different ways there are to eat in a way that's healthy and satisfying …he finally led to the conclusion that if man cannot live by bread alone…then a woman probably shouldn't either…and when Jeff was working too hard…Erickson reminded him…there's more to life than protein…and how does an unconscious mind understand deeper messages? …and translate them into subtle  changes that  really  feel  good …well, let your conscious mind chew on that for a while…and if you ever have the experience of being crusty and discovering yourself taking it too seriously…there will come an opportunity to remind yourself…that when you don't understand why you do what  you  do…that's  the  time  for  the  services  of  a  good  trance-later…or perhaps a trance now… I don't know which…but I do know…that it could be the feeling…of amusement guiding you…it doesn't detract from the\nsignificance  of  what  you've  learned…it  can  be  the  lingering  feeling…long after…of feeling good about what you've done…and whether you'll remember that…consciously  or  unconsciously…or  both…you  really  won't  know…until you re-orient in a moment…and find your eyes opening…to discover what you know…that's  different…take  your  time…before  you  have  that  eye-opening experience….\nThe  client's  response  to  the  confusional  suggestions  was  an  amused  detachment  that highlighted to her how impactful things on a nonrational level could be. Given her usual emphasis on logic, a pattern which did not assist her in losing weight or keeping it off, she found it meaningful to discover how subjective and malleable her experiences really are. She made frequent use of the tape of this session that was given to her, and found the phrase  'woman  cannot  live  by  bread  alone'  coming  back  to  her  in  a  lighthearted  way when passing by the bakery where she normally stopped and bought bread. The use of humor in the session associated a positive emotional tone to the content of the session. As with all patterns, humor must be used selectively.",

He was undergoing a major shift in responsibilities in his  job  as  an  administrator  in  a  construction  company,  his  first  child  (age  four)  was suffering  health  problems,  and  his  wife  was  pregnant  with  their  third  child.  He  felt  as though every domain of his life was unsettled and a source of stress, and wanted to learn to manage stress more effectively in order to prevent any debilitating effects. He shared his  fantasy  of  escaping  to  a  Caribbean  island,  and  wished  there  was  a  way  to  prevent stressful events from happening in his life. The following transcript represents a hypnosis session done in the first of seven sessions.\n… Alright Ken, you can begin by taking in a few, deep relaxing breaths…and you  can  begin  now  to  orient  yourself…to  the  possibility  of  feeling…very comfortable…and very relaxed…and little by little as the world goes on around you…why not make yourself really comfortable…of course the more absorbed you get…in your own inner experience…the less it really matters what's going on in the world around you…everybody needs a little bit of time away…a little bit  of  a  break…to  turn  their  attention  in  a  different  direction…and  one  of  my favorite television shows is M*A*S*H…and I don't know if you're a fan of that show  or  not…but  it  will  happen  from  time  to  time…that  the  M*A*S*H hospital…will be shelled by the enemy…and numerous explosions take place… as the shells rain down…and everyone runs around scared and overwhelmed… unsure  if  they'll  be  able  to  survive…and  you  can  imagine…how  fighting  for your life…can be a very serious battle…and then what always happens at some point  along  the  way…is  that  the  shelling  stops…and  someone  will  offer  the comment…to listen to the silence …(pause)…and in living life each day. . . the\nshelling  takes  a  lot  of  different  forms…the  shelling  can  be  hassles  with  other people…concerns  about  the  environment…doubts  with  one's  self  about  what one  should  do…the  battles  can  be  inside…they  can  be  outside…they  can  be brief…they can be tolerable…they can be inspirational…they can cause growth…they can foster creativity in finding ways to see beyond the moment… but there come quiet times…times when all the hoopla is over…when the noise stops…when  your  thoughts  slow  down…and  when  nothing  really  seems  to matter very much…and it's those quiet times that prepare you so well …for the times that aren't so quiet…the few seconds that can feel like a lot longer period of  quiet…they restore  comfort…and balance…that strengthen you…for any… and all future occasions… where patience and understanding…might work quite well…and right now you're in one of those periods of silence…and the world is so  unpredictable…it's  hard  to  know…whether  things  will  still  be  quiet…next week…next  month…next  year…and  it  really  doesn't  matter…all  that  really matters…is how you use your quiet period now…whether you use the time to strengthen  yourself … and  pamper  yourself …to congratulate  yourself …and  to appreciate your ability to grow and do much more than just survive…and for a while when I was much younger… I had the experience of living on the island of  Jamaica… I lived in a very small village…on the west end of the island… where very few Americans actually go…and nobody there knew how to read… nobody  knew  how  to  write…nobody  was  informed  about  world  events…the Jamaicans  were  shocked  and  disbelieving…when  I  described  to  them  how Americans had put men on the moon…and brought them back safely again… and despite their ignorance…there was a certain satisfaction…in understanding the island on which they lived…where most of the time the sky is so clear and blue…but  as  is  typical  of  the  tropics…every  once  in  a  while…huge  clouds would roll in…and there would be heavy rain and thunder and lightning…and then the clouds would roll out again…and at first I found it very unsettling…that unexpectedly…my  enjoyment  of  the  sunshine…could  be  interrupted  at  any moment…and obviously, I had no control…over thunder…and rain…and you learn  very  quickly…that  the  loudness…can  be  so  well  appreciated  by  the counter balance of quiet…and that it's the loudness…that makes the rain forest come alive…and allows the growth to take place…and sometimes it's inconvenient…sometimes it seems unnecessary…but the fact of the matter…is that  the  darkness  of  rain…leads  to  the  lush  vegetation's  growth…that  permits the pleasure…and all things are balanced…and how good it feels for you to be settled comfortably…and  how  well  it  prepares  you  for  periods  of  being unsettled…just as periods of being unsettled…allow you to really appreciate… settled,  comfortable  times…like  now…and  why  not  enjoy…quiet  times…and appreciate what they have to offer…and why not accept the inevitable…that rain falls…and people change…and things get better…a day at a time…as you grow more tolerant …and enjoy greater periods of comfort and stability …it can grow easier and easier…to move flexibly and fluidly…through the rain and through the  shine…whether  you're  in  Jamaica  or  San  Diego…  Europe  or  Africa…the sunshine on the inside…makes it easy to deal with the rain on the outside…and",

He thought of Hawkeye in particular, and how he uses humor to stay sane in an insane situation. He decided that he would act similarly, and gave himself the assignment of  making  a  point  of  telling  jokes  to  people  as  a  way  of  easing  tense  situations.  He thought  that  approach  to  be  a  positive  stress-management  tool  in  addition  to  the  selfhypnosis  he  was  taught,  and  related  it  further  to  things  he  had  read  about  humor  and healing.

        "text": "Vicki was referred to me for a single hypnosis session by her co-therapists, Lillian and Harold. She had been in treatment with them over the course of several years and, as you will see, greatly benefited from her work with them. She had progressed from apparent emotional instability with no real focus in life to becoming a highly successful graduate student  eventually  pursuing  a  career  in  counseling.  Her  new  life  plan  came  to  a screeching  halt,  however,  when  she  was  formally  diagnosed  as  having  advanced-stage cancer throughout her body, with a very short time to live.\nLillian and Harold, associates from a mutual university affiliation, referred Vicki to me for a hypnosis session with the hope that hypnosis might be useful in helping her manage both  the  emotional  shock  and  the  physical  discomfort  associated  with  her  terminal condition. Lillian was the one who contacted me by phone and asked if I could see Vicki. As it so happened, I would be unable to see her for an individual session in the immediate future because of a scheduled teaching trip. I volunteered, however, to do a session with her  if  she  was  willing  to  do  it  in  the  context  of  an  advanced  hypnosis  course  I  was teaching. Lillian's immediate reaction was positive; she believed that the opportunity for Vicki to work some things out in a group context would be of great benefit to her.\nWhen  I  am  referred  a  new  client,  I  typically  prefer  not  to  hear  the  diagnostic impression  of  the  person  making  the  referral.  I  much  prefer  to  arrive  at  my  own diagnostic  impressions  without  the  influence  of  someone  else's  judgment.  Thus,  when Lillian began to describe Vicki, I asked her to share only minimal information about her, specifically the goals associated with the referral. When I see someone more than once, I am then likely to call the referring clinician after the first session and ask for whatever additional data he or she may have regarding the client.\nSo, at the outset of the session, I knew only Vicki's name, her general goal of wanting to cope as well as possible with truly tragic circumstances, and the fact that she was held",

And, so I would like to have some way of coping with the pain without being… I'm not afraid of becoming an addict. I  dominant theme which becomes a core can live being an addict, I suppose, but I don't want to miss the time that I have left. I would like to have…my interest is in being able to alleviate pain without drugs. Vicki's beginning remarks orient me to her goal of managing her condition naturalistically. Notice her immediate emphasis on the issue of 'time,' a dimension of the hypnosis session.\nM: I really know very little about what's going on with you and in your life right now. Can you give me a little bit of background?\nV: I have cancer that is, they don't even know where the primary is, but it's throughout my body. I have it in the brain, in the bone, in the lung, in the adrenal glands,  Vicki's time frame has been established in the lymph system-everywhere. And they say-my doctor says I'll be surprised if you don't live a month. I'll be astounded if you live a year and we think we're talking three to four months.' And I'm okay with by the physician giving her the prognosis. She speaks in terms of 'parts,' distinguishing one part of her experience from another. This is a clue\nthat… I'm not, the death part is not the hard part. The hard part is being able to get done all that I want to get done in the time that I have left, and make sure that everybody's dealing with it, which is the second hardest part.\nthat she will be able to benefit from an approach that emphasizes dissociation, since she is already used to thinking in terms of 'part of me is experiencing this while part of me is\nMy family wants to stick their head in the sand and they don't want to deal with it and I keep saying 'You have to because you don't-I don't have time to wait for you and do it your own way. You have to do it my way now, you know.' So time is the thing and being drugged, and they want right away to put you on very heavy drugs, and I'm very sensitive to drugs, and it just makes me sleep which I don't want to sleep my time away, you know. I have a lot of things to say and a lot of things to do and I want to be able to do those things in the time that I have.\nexperiencing that.' Further interviewing will permit me to determine just how adept at dissociation she really is. The issue of 'time' is reiterated as she introduces the 'power struggle' she experiences with her family.\nVicki lets me know she wants to be active during this time, saying and doing the things she feels are necessary.\nM: How long ago were you diagnosed, Vicki?\nV: Three weeks ago.\nM: Okay.\nV: Anger's another thing that I wish I had time to deal with, because I have a lot of anger, because I've been going to doctors for four years, saying I'm sick, I'm very sick, I'm sick, and they say 'No, you're a hypochondriac. You just think you're sick. You're making yourself-' all these things and even doctors that refused to examine me. And I have a lot of anger at doctors because if I had been diagnosed, if they would have listened to me as I was listening to my body tell me that I was sick it would have been a different trip. So I have a lot of anger at doctors, but I finally decided that I just don't have time to deal with that so I'm going to skip that part.\nM : You're saying that you presented physical complaints to doctors, and basically they ignored it?\nV: Yeah, I could tell you a lot of horror stories about that but, you know, even doctors that just refused to examine me, which at that point, my idea was even hypochondriacs get sick! I at least deserve an examination and was told 'No.' I mean a lot of really bad… Even seven months ago, I went so far as to have a biopsy done and the doctor missed it, because he was going on\nVicki acknowledges she has angry feelings, but indicates she does not have the time to deal with her feelings-a realistic choice to make given the shortage of time.\nVicki states clearly that she is able to dissociate from her angry feelings out of necessity. This needs to be acknowledged, but it is not yet known\nwhether she is truly able to dissociate her feelings to the extent she claims.\nFurther acknowledgement of\nvacation that day and he was in a hurry and he was… You know all these just really coincidental things, kind of things that-you can't really put-I mean everything has its explanation but the whole thing makes a real ugly package, you know. So a lot of anger there that I'm just kind of trying not to-I'm just saying that I don't have time. You have to prioritize and you have to say what's really important and getting my family okay with this and getting my affairs in order and dealing with it spiritually and physically is more important than kicking butts.\nangry feelings she attempts to dissociate from. She also shows an ability to prioritize and sequence her involvements, evidence of a more concrete and linear style of thinkingimportant diagnostic information for the construction of an appropriate hypnosis session.\nM: Can you tell me a little bit about your family and what the family situation is right now?\nV: I'm in the process of divorce which is being a real complication for me because my husband has decided that, well he's figured out that-we were very close to making a financial agreement-we haven't lived together for five years and he has\nInformation is sought regarding her support network and associated relationship issues.\nVicki identifies her husband as a source of distress.\nanother family-and we were very close to coming to a financial agreement which was substantial but he's figured out now that if he prolongs, he gets it all. So he's decided that he's not going to participate in any way financially and that he's just going to drag it off and… That was a real shock, that was a real shock for me because I think if he would have called me and had been-this is the hard part (becomes tearful) -I would have helped him and he won't help me but that's only financial consideration, puts me in a financial bind because I'm not eligible for aid because I'm married and his income is considered, but he won't give me any of it, so I'm stuck. He thinks I should go to Balboa Hospital, and the one thing I don't want is to spend the rest of my life sitting in a waiting room at Balboa Hospital, that's the one thing I don't want to do. So that part of my family is not, the rest of my family is very supportive. I have a lot of very supportive friends and I have a daughter that's twenty-three and she wants to run and hide and I'm not letting her and it's being difficult for her and that, she's probably my number 1 concern. Just a lot of friends that are being real supportive and that helps a lot.

And I went along with that because it was my family's wish and all the while that he died, he never mentioned to them that he was dying and they never mentioned to him and everybody, I mean it was so stupid and when I got back to Colorado I thought the worst thing that I did was not to sit down with him and say, 'You want to talk about it?' So I did a lot of thinking at that time about it and now, to me, I have to talk about it and some people find that really difficult to deal with. It's just the way that I have to do it. I have to. And the more that I do it, the more okay I feel and not only that but the more I do it, the more I know that other people are okay and if other people are okay, I feel better.

We're managing to do it, but it's hard.\nM: What would you want her to know? What would you want her to understand?\nV: Something really-like a miracle happened the other day because when she first found out, she took off and went to Mexico and really running. I keep sitting her down saying, 'This is serious. You can't run away. We don't have time to play games. You have to, we have to deal with it.' 'Well, what do you want me to do, what do you want from me?' She's really confused about it and, for some reason I'm able to get across to other people what my needs are, but I can't to her because she's so afraid. And the other day she got back from Mexico and she was at my house and she was sitting on the bed and she was giving me this 'what do you want from me?' and 'I don't know what you want from me,' and I just, I didn't know what to say and in popped one of her friends that she'd had ever since she was real little, popped in the door and ran in the bedroom and plopped down on the bed and said 'My God. Tell me what it's like to know you're going to die.' You know, my daughter's sitting there and this is her friend and… So Linne and I started to talk and I started to tell her, and then she'd say, 'And then what does it feel like? Does it hurt?' Just asking this whole, the kind of questions that you don't know how to ask and here's this kid\nsitting there asking and my daughter kind of curled up on the pillows and was a little mouse and said …We asked, we went on for about two hours, and we asked her, no participation at all, she was like the mouse in the room. We talked about her like she wasn't there and Linne said 'What's your greatest fear?' and I said that my greatest fear is that I won't be able to sit and talk to her the way, or talk to Carrie the way I can talk to you. Still there was nothing required of her at all. But things changed after that, things changed. You know, it was like all of a sudden she had at least some understanding of what my needs were and  of person B influences B how communication can work beneficially and openness is necessary as I don't have time to play games.

And everything  we come across, in your own time and in your own way you will  accept. Right now, I don't have time so I have to push and maybe I'll  push too hard and it'll hurt her more than help her but I have to take  that chance because I don't have the time. So it's…, 1 = Time is reiterated as a  vital issue.. M:  Do you have the sense that there are things that you want to say to  her and she to you?  V:, 1 = . My biggest fear is that five years down the road she's not going to  be able to deal with it because she's going to say 'I stuck my head in, 1 = Vicki shows an ability to  have foresight that is of\ntalked.' It's more urgent for her than for me. I don't have trouble verbalizing; I say what I feel and what I think and I don't feel… There's a lot of things I feel like I want to say, you know, 'Put your seat belt on' and stuff, but things that I would like to share, family things, but the urgency in my mind is in her ability to deal with it herself after it's over; that she can say we spent quality time, that we did the best we could do for each other in whatever time we had, that she doesn't feel guilty, and that she doesn't have this after thing that's going to make it harder for her to facilitate the rest of her life.\nM: So when you were talking earlier about family members sticking their head in the sand, were you referring specifically to her or others as well?\nV: Her father-my first-my husband that I'm trying to get a divorce from-I've been married fifteen years-her father I was married to years ago and we've been really close friends all these years and he was at the hospital when they did the diagnosis and he took off and hasn't been seen since. I mean, he's the one that taught her how to do this. And he's not dealing with it, and that's okay. I'm not really too concerned with him. Another one that I'm really concerned with is my mother. My mother's sixty-nine and, but really she's ninety-nine. I take care of her totally and so, and I think in my mind the hardest thing in the world to do would be  source of to lose a child. I've never been close to my mother, my\nVicki identifies her mother as a distress.\nVicki emphasizes how she values being dominant theme throughout her\nVicki identifies her estranged son as a source of distress.\nmother and I have never been close. And we're becoming that now. She's trying very hard to understand my philosophies which-she's never listened to me and now she's listening and she'll get my philosophy books  listened to, a and she'll bring them and want me to read to her and she asks me questions and she talks to me. I think that's a neat thing that's happening. I feel much closer to her. I have a son, this is another sad part, I have a son  presentation. that is in trouble and my husband has turned him against me and he hates me. That hurts me a lot. I expect probably not to see him again and if I did see him again I think it would be a difficult time. He's a strange boy and he would come to me and he would say 'I love you,' and a lot of things that he doesn't feel. He's not bonded to me very much and he, you know, I do better, I do better with people that put it out just the way it is: 'I don't\nfeel very close to you but I wish I'd had a chance to get to know you,' or something like that, rather than 'I love you and I can't stand losing you' and all the stuff that's just crap, you know. I don't want any crap. If I do get a chance to see him again I think that that's going to be very difficult to deal with. He doesn't have the emotional-he's a very immature, emotionally immature person who just needs a lot of, lot of time to get it together. So I don't, I really-that's a hard one and I don't know what's going to happen with that. I have an aunt that doesn't speak to me, that… My family were taught, my mother and all of my family were taught when  By now, it is clear they Vicki has an aunt who is a source of distress, who embodies the 'if you're angry, clam up' approach that Vicki feels is a waste of valuable communication time. that\nwere very young that when you got angry at someone you quit talking to them.

But it was a relief to have some kind of diagnosis. It's an awful thing to know that you're awfully sick and have people tell you that you're not.

What do you think the best way would have been to have responded to you?\nV: Just listen to me. I got a diagnosis only because of my own tantrum. One day I threw a tantrum. You see, I knew that there was something in my lung and, like I said, six or seven months ago I had a lung biopsy, and then I kept going back to doctors and going back and they kept saying 'It's not your lung. We did the lung, right? We had a biopsy on your lung, we checked your lung. It's not your…' I said 'But it is my lung. I lived in this body forty-two years. I kind of got to know it a little bit. Something is wrong in my lung.' 'No, it's not your lung because we've done all the tests on your lung.' So we go off, we go off, and I went through the seven months and then one day I just had a tantrum. I said 'Can't somebody at least do a chest x-ray? What the hell is it going to hurt to do a chest x-ray?' 'All right, if you'll just shut up we'll do it.' And then it was a tumor about this size (the size of a golfball) that shows up in my lung. And if I hadn't had that tantrum that day they would've never even at this time had a diagnosis.

I suppose there's a considerable amount of chest pain, but I've been dealing with that for a long time so it's kind of… See, I learned, it's kind of a strange thing because for four years I've had a lot of pain. It started in my joints and my muscles, all over my body. Like terrible arthritis, and I kept going to doctors and they'd say there's no ar\nthritis here. Of course it wasn't, it was cancer but they didn't look  Vicki describes an ability to past and they kept telling me that there wasn't anything that could be causing that pain and so I finally got to the point where I  overcome pain, a potentially said 'Okay. I'm a full-time student; I'm a very active person; I can't get slowed down by pain and so there just won't be pain.' So I spent a lot of time teaching myself how not to perceive the pain or how to let my brain override the pain to some degree. And now that I have a diagnosis I find myself feeling the pain, allowing myself to feel the pain. So it's a real different kind of thing for me to do and now that I've allowed myself to feel the pain I'm trying to find this place in between where I, because I know that the mind controls so much of what you feel, there must be a place where I can, I don't want to be totally unaware of it, but I want to be able to deal with it because I got so confused in this period where you feel pain and people are telling you there's no pain. It gets you real confused. I don't know exactly what I'm feeling is what I'm feeling. Know what I mean? Well, my level of feeling is, may not be, what's real.

Vicki's references to confusion reflect the antitherapeutic aspects of confusion.

I have tornadoes that  methods of come down-white tornadoes that come down and get rid of-and I can get into it. I really get into it. I see it. I try to do it quite a bit every day and I spend time on that radiation-getting radiation therapy is like going and putting yourself in a giant microwave and turning it on is how I visualize it. I try to do it while I'm there but it's such an awesome place to be it's kind of hard to do there.\nSometimes I can do it, sometimes I can't. There's a big switch on the wall that says 'Emergency Shut Off' and I look at it and I just want to get up and shut it off. I suspect very strongly that radiation is the cause of my problems. I was radiated as a child in an experimental kind of thing and most of the people that had this radiation as children are coming up with this kind of… It's hard to imagine that radiation is the cause and radiation is how we diagnose and how we treat. Those things are hard to put together. To put yourself in a microwave is kind of a difficult thing to do. But other places it works a lot better. It feels good to me. I don't know if it's working or not but it feels good to me and so I do it.\nM: So you're able to relax and you're able to get into it? Great.\nV: Sometimes. Depending where I'm at. Sometimes it's easier than other times. Sometimes it's just really fantastic. I also do meditation which I've done for a long time and that's always helped me and so I hang onto that. I haven't really done too much other kind of relaxation. For a while, I was doing it but now that they've got me on-Tylenol III puts me in a place that's never-never land. I don't really need to relax for that reason. I think that I'm really probably much more relaxed than most people. My doctor says that he never had anybody fall asleep on the radiation table before and every once in a while I fall asleep, and my arm will fall off in all positions. I've always been the kind\nof person that you give an aspirin to and I go to sleep, so I react very strongly to these drugs.\nM: What is your experience with the Tylenol III in terms of what it does to you mentally?

Radiation destroys good cells as well as bad cells. My area of study is physiological psychology so I know a little bit of physiology and I know that the brain cells don't regenerate. Now, they radiate my shoulder and I know that they destroy the good cells as well as the bad cells and that they can regenerate to some degree. But I know my brain cells can't so I'm very much afraid of losing my brain cells and I find myself not thinking good, not remembering things, talking to someone on the phone one day and the next day not remembering. A lot of memory stuff leaving and it makes me feel a bit panicky. I don't know if it's the radiation or if it's just that I have so many things on my mind and my mind is so totally occupied with all that's going on. I have this really silly thing ever since I can't remember how old-I've never been able to throw anything away. A little piece of string-somebody in the world needs this little piece of string and I'm not going to take it to the dump, I'm going to save it for this person who might need it and maybe I'll\nhave a garage sale some day and sell it for a penny.\nSo all my life I've saved all these things and I know if I die everybody's going to take all my junk and put it in the garbage can and that just kills me. One of my real goals is I have to have, I finally have to have my yard sale. I also have to look at each and every thing that I have that I love and care about-I have these little stickers that I'm sticking on the backs of-I have to figure out who's going to love this thing the most. So I have all these things to do, so I have a lot of things on my mind. It could be that just the mind is so full that it doesn't have time to remember who I talked to on the phone yesterday Maybe the radiation isn't the only thing that's killing my mind. Maybe it's just too full.\nM: The burden of thinking about everything, and everybody.\nV: But I do worry about that. I don't want to destroy my brain. I want my brain to survive.",

I'm afraid of that, so each thing has to be evaluated on its individual kind of basis.\nM: You said that you had been working and then you stopped working and went back to school. That's a pretty major change. How did that come about?\nV: I've wanted to go to school all my life and I put my husband through school and I raised a family and it always got put off.\nM: Sort of time to do something for yourself.\nV: I got to a point where I figured out that I had some value and I had some worth. I lived fifteen years in a violent marriage. My husband was a very violent person and I spent most of my life thinking that I wasn't very deserving and wasn't very-that I was worthless, very low self-esteem. It's taken the last five years, I've really gotten that turned around and figured out that I had a lot of value and a lot of worth and knew where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do, exactly what I wanted.

I'd been carrying a 4.0 average at school and so I've been feeling very good about myself. At first I thought I feel real sad that I'm not going to reach my goals but then I decided that maybe the important thing was to figure out that I could and that I had the worth  An interpretation of the and the value and maybe that's the lesson I had to learn. 'meaning' of her disease.\nM: That's a pretty amazing discovery.\nV: To get there wasn't the main thing. To just discover was the main thing.\nShe accepts that ratification.\nM: How did you find that after all those years of being in such a difficult relationship?\nI am asking her to identify her method-the sequence of steps used-to effect a significant transition. She\nBy accepting her interpretation, she is permitted to focus on her progress rather than on the frustration of never reaching her goal.\nV: Well, it's a long story. Twenty years ago I had, my husband put me in a psychiatric hospital and I was diagnosed catatonicschizophrenia, a back ward patient that would never be out of the hospital again and that's an awfully hard label to overcome. Two months ago I went out into the community and I wanted to get into a women's group, a women's support group, I guess about four months ago, and I started interviewing clinicians because I learned to do that. So if they interviewed me, I interviewed them. And this woman I hit with some of my background because I've been in and out of hospitals a good part of my life and she\nmay identify a usable resource for the later hypnosis session.\nHere are some of the specifics that led to the earlier sermon about labelling.\nAnother personal rejection on the basis of an impersonal label.\ntold me that I was too sick to be in her group. After one hour of talking to me, and then charging me for the session which I thought was kind of crummy. There's so much of that that goes on that I use it as kind of a tester now. If you see my labels faster than you see me then I can just get up and walk away. I don't need you in my life anymore. That's a real dangerous thing that happens. I progressed, I fought and I never gave up and I overcame all those things, mostly… Another thing that I think was important in my history is that they, of course at that time, drugs were coming in, psychotropic drugs and they gave me so many psychotropic drugs and I had such horrible side effects from them. I would try to tell people I'm…and nobody would listen to me and they would say 'You need more Thorazine.' The more they gave me, the sicker I got. I kept trying to tell people, nobody listened. That's when I first learned that people don't listen. My husband kept me in this kind of mindset. I guess it's pretty awful but I overcame it, that's the thing.\nShe identifies 'fighting and never giving up' as the relevant resources for her changes.\nM: I'm amazed. It's obviously against all the odds…\nV: That's why my interest is in physiological psychology because I had just had a complete hysterectomy. There was a lot of physiological things going on in my  attributing her life at the time that this happened and I really truly believe that there's so much to the chemical brain structure. I really do. I think it was my biggest problem\nbeside the fact that my husband stole away my person or I let my husband steal my person. And that I had such low selfesteem. I think the chemical makeup of my body at the time was a real key factor and so that's why my interest of study was in that area. I thought that I wanted to make some discoveries that-I knew what it felt like to be on the inside. I knew what it felt like to be in a psychiatric hospital where nobody listened. Have you ever read that study, I forget who did it, where the psychologists all admitted themselves and\nWhat she learned in therapy-to accept responsibility-is given lip service, but she clearly has not yet internalized the lesson. In her situation, that is actually an advantage since a more internal attribution would likely lead to depression.\nShe is emotional difficulties to a chemical imbalance.\nthey… Well, that was my life. People don't hear you. You're a nonentity and that's such a horrible thing to be.\nM: Did you have the idea that you could be a 4.0 student? Go back to school and accomplish these things all that time?\nV: Not all that time. No.\nM: You got in touch with that much later?\nV: There came a point where I-one day I was living with my husband on the East Coast and my husband's a commander in the Navy. He was stationed in the East. And the anger grew and grew with him and I found myself standing over him one night with a fireplace poker and I knew that I was going to kill him if I didn't get away from him. The next day I found myself standing on a bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge or one of those bridges, and I was going to jump and\nI said 'What is it that I'm sorry I didn't do?' Is there any thing that I'm sorry… I just couldn't take it anymore, and I said, you know, I always wanted to go to Colorado and I never did. Then I thought, what the hell. Why don't I go to Colorado and if I can't-if it doesn't work out then I'll jump off a mountain. So I went home and I packed myself a backpack and I got in my husband's wallet and I got about $400 out and I took off and I went to Colorado and that's when things turned around for me, because-it was the middle of winter, I slept-I lived on the street. I had a hard time but I began to realize that there was a 'me' and I could function totally without him, that I didn't need someone to tell me that I was okay or I wasn't okay. It also goes back to childhood. My father was killed when I was a year old, in the War. My mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict. I had no siblings. I never lived with any one family more than just a few months. I mean I was never-I didn't have a family life so I didn't know how to do that. I never had any… So I was used to people who didn't love me and it was like this super goal to find people who don't know how to love and make them love me. My husband never knew how to love; he was incapable of loving. He isn't capable of loving and yet, just somebody who could easily love me wasn't what I needed. I needed the mother who couldn't, the husband that couldn't, I needed all the couldn'ts to do it. That became my whole life's goal. Well, that's a stupid goal. I mean I\nwasted my whole life trying to do that and it doesn't work. So I learned that. That was one thing that I learned. That if you want somebody to love you, you have to find-first of all it has to come from within. You're your own best parent, that you have to love yourself, which is such a cliche that unless you really get inside yourself and learn that it sounds so stupid. For years I thought 'love yourself,' people keep saying that but how stupid, what a stupid thing\nThe benefits of her therapy are showing in these insights about her life patterns.\nVicki is letting me know that individuation and self-validation were the keys to her reaching for and achieving more\nI am wanting to amplify her ability to pleasantly surprise herself with abilities she did not know she had.",

Well, the morning before yesterday, my daughter got up and went to work and I thought I'd be fine until my aunt came to help me take a shower and take me to my treatment, and I could get my bowl of cereal which I was going to have and everything went to hell. I got up, I didn't make it to the bathroom in time. I messed myself and I started throwing up and I threw up all over the house and I got the bowl of cereal and I dumped it on the floor and pretty soon I just found myself sitting in the middle of the floor, saying 'I'd rather be dead.' And when you get that kind of moment,",

Having worked with imagery before, and having worked with meditation and the different kinds of relaxation processes, you know what it's like to be able to close your eyes, go inside, have different kinds of experiences internally. Basically I'm going to talk about different ideas, different possibilities. There isn't really anything that you have to do, Vicki. All I really want you to do is give yourself the opportunity to experience whatever it occurs to you to experience. I'm going to be talking about different possibilities, different potentials, and  building the response set it's really going to be for you to take what makes sense to you, leave behind what doesn't make sense to you, and that's about it.

I received a warm thank-you note from her a few days after our session, and spoke to  her  once  on  the  phone  for  some  follow-up.  She  reported  that  she  was  using  the audiotape of our session that I had provided, and found it very helpful. She was able to make use of the physical dissociation and time distortion techniques, which helped her cope  with  the  most  recent  round  of  radiation  she  was  receiving.  She  reported  feeling pleased she was managing her daily regimens without pain medications. She managed to function reasonably well for a short while after our meeting, but after just a few weeks her illness became too severe to self-manage.\nAfter Vicki left, the group of clinicians in attendance was noticeably quiet. It took us all awhile to open up and process the session, each of us dealing with our own vulnerable feelings about encountering a remarkable woman so courageously facing death, as well as our hurt feelings about how badly some clinicians had treated her. After so much pain in  her  life,  Vicki  was  in  the  process  of  first  discovering  her  uniqueness  and  strength, while evolving her first real vision of what she had the potential to become. How cruel that just as Vicki was getting her life together, her life was lost. Yet, you can recall her saying that even though at first she was sad her dreams wouldn't happen, she could feel good  discovering  some  of  her  own  potential.  That  attitude  was  nothing  short  of remarkable. Vicki was easy to admire, and I was deeply saddened by her death.\nI cannot  imagine  a  more  dramatic  way  to  get  across  the  message  to  helping professionals to 'listen to your client' than to be exposed to Vicki. She had so much to say,  but  her  voice  was  drowned  out  by  the  labels  some  people  gave  her. Too  many\nShe cut me off to quickly agree to\nwhatever I would ask of her! I think that is fairly good evidence for a high level of rapport!",

        "text": "By  now  you  have  most  likely  had  the  experience  of  performing  hypnotic  inductions, facilitating  hypnotic  phenomena,  and  structuring  and  delivering  suggestions  to  other people  during  hypnosis  that  were  meant  to  be  helpful  to  them.  As  you  have  no  doubt discovered from your direct experience, peoples' responses to your hypnotic processes can  range  from  minimal  to  dramatic.  You  can  now  better  appreciate  why  assessing hypnotizability  has  been  the  subject  of  serious  inquiry  as  researchers  and  clinicians attempt  to  understand  why  people  differ  so  substantially  in  their  abilities  to  respond. Hypnosis  as  a  vehicle  for  delineating  individual  differences  is  a  very  active  and interesting domain of research into the areas of human personality and cognition.\nThe main focus of this chapter, though, is addressing these two questions: How shall we interpret either a lack of responsiveness to hypnotic suggestions (i.e., an inability to manifest  a  particular  suggested  hypnotic  phenomenon  or  an  inability  to  integrate  and apply  a  suggested  resolution  to  a  problem)  or,  worse,  a  negative  response?  And,  how might we effectively respond to those individuals who are not particularly responsive to our hypnotic procedures?\nClinicians'  responses to minimal or negative responses to their hypnotic suggestions have ranged from labeling unresponsive clients 'resistant' to labeling the clinicians inept (or  worse).  These  extreme  views  reflect  interesting  attributions  (i.e.,  explanations)  that reveal a  pattern  called  'attributional  style,'  a  person's  characteristic  way  of  explaining the meaning of life events (Seligman, 1989; Yapko, 1992). An internal attribution is one that suggests the reason something happened the way that it did is somehow 'because of me.' An external attribution says, in essence, that it happened the way it did 'because of the other person' or 'because of the circumstances.'\nIn the realms of hypnosis and psychotherapy, the attributions that clinicians make for unsuccessful hypnosis sessions or therapies tend to be external, that is, it was the client's fault.  Clinicians  routinely  say  things  like,  'The  person  wasn't  ready  for  change,'  'The person was getting too many secondary gains,' 'The person was too threatened by the therapy,' and the ever-popular, especially in hypnosis, 'The client isn't hypnotizable,' or, 'The  client  is  resistant.'  Might  any  of  these  external  attributions  for  a  lack  of  client responsiveness be true at times? Yes. But, might they also be blaming the client unfairly at  times  for  what  may  be  a  limitation  in  the  clinician's  approach?  Yes.  I  strongly encourage clinicians to recognize, before they reflexively declare a client resistant, that they may have played a bigger role in the client's responses than they at first realized. When there are two people (or more) in an interaction, there is a shared responsibility for the outcome. This point is true enough to discourage entirely internal attributions as well, that is, 'It's totally my fault the person reacted that way.'",

        "text": "The literature pertaining to clinical hypnosis has generally had quite a lot to say about the issue of client resistance. Historically, resistance was considered to be a manifestation of the client's defenses for coping with sensitive or unresolved intrapsychic conflicts, and thus perceived as a psychological vulnerability of the client's (Greenleaf, 2001). 'Proper' treatment  was  a  confrontive  inquiry  about  the  appearance  of  the  resistance,  first acknowledging  it, next attempting to uncover its origin and function, and then collaborating  on  its  resolution.  Weitzenhoffer  summarized  this  viewpoint  succinctly when he wrote, 'Unconscious resistance…always has its source in the psychodynamics of  the  subject,  and  overcoming  or  circumventing  it  is  frequently  dependent  upon understanding these psychodynamics and acting accordingly… At a conscious level, he may  want  hypnosis,  but  may  be  very  much  threatened  by  it  at  an  unconscious level' (2000, pp. 204-5).\nFrom this perspective, resistance was always the client's problem. When it interfered with the progress of therapy, as it inevitably did, the client was blamed as the saboteur. Accusations  and  interpretations  were  thrust  at  the  client  who  obviously  'really  didn't want to change,' or perhaps was 'too resistant to succeed.'\nResistance can be described, for all intents and purposes, as a force that works against the aims of therapy. Resistance has long been recognized as an integral and unavoidable component  of  the  therapeutic  process,  and  virtually  every  therapeutic  approach  I  am aware of has roughly equivalent recognitions of its existence. Only the rationale for its presence and the techniques for its acknowledgment and treatment differ from approach to approach.\nDescribing resistance as a force that works against the aims of therapy doesn't place blame on either the clinician or client. Rather than view people who come in voluntarily (dealing  with  persons  in  treatment  involuntarily  differs  in  some  ways)  for  help  as  not really wanting help when we try things that don't work very well, it seems much more practical  to  view  resistance  as  a  communication  from  the  client  about  his  or  her limitations in relating to the world (of which the clinician is obviously a part). In other words,  resistance  isn't  a  fixed  property  of  the  client,  but  rather  can  be  viewed  as  a dynamic  communication  indicating  the  limits  of  what  the  client  can  and  cannot  do. Rather than blame the client, the communication can be accepted as a valid indication of the person's experience of him- or herself (Zeig, 1980).\nPlacing this general perspective in the context of doing clinical hypnosis, resistance is not  necessarily  an  indication  of  unconscious  sabotage  on  the  part  of  the  client.  It  is frequently the case that the client is simply making a choice at some level not to respond in the desired way to suggestions for any of a variety of other reasons, each of which has a common denominator: The suggestion simply does not fit with the person's experience, and,  in  fact,  may  even  contradict  it. Resistance  may  be  viewed  as  an  interpersonal statement  that  says  that whatever  therapeutic  strategies  and  maneuvers  are  being performed are not acceptable at some level(s) to the client.\nResistance is a real force to reckon with in treatment, and can be tied to one or both of the two main areas of treatment: resistance to hypnosis, and/or resistance to therapeutic\nprogress.",

        "text": "Undesirable responses to hypnosis can be manifested in a variety of ways. The client may actively  or  passively  refuse  to  go  into  hypnosis,  or  may  enter  hypnosis  but  refuse  to respond to the suggestions of the clinician. Examples of potentially contrary behaviors include, but are not limited to: fidgeting, smiling, laughing,  crying, interrupting, spontaneous  disengagements,  polar  (opposite)  responses,  over-cooperation,  coughing, and  direct  or  passive-aggressive  hostility  aimed  at  the  clinician  (Weitzenhoffer,  2000). Responses  such  as  these  are  not  necessarily  resistant.  They  may  be  idiosyncratic responses that occur without interfering with the course of treatment (Gilligan, 1987).\nOrigins of resistance to hypnosis can be numerous. One of the most common is the fear of what will happen during hypnosis. If the client is misinformed about the nature of the hypnotic experience, he or she may fear it. All the misconceptions discussed in detail in chapter  2  may  be  all  that  someone  knows  about  hypnosis.  If  you  thought  you  might divulge  sensitive  information,  be  coerced  into  doing  things  against  your  will,  or  be controlled  by  someone  you  really  don't  know  much  about,  would you want  to  be hypnotized?\nResistance to hypnosis may also arise because of past failures associated with it, either from  personal  experience  or  the  experience  of  credible  others.  Furthermore,  resistance may also arise from negative feelings toward the clinician (thus highlighting the value of rapport), and from contextual variables such as the immediate environment, the client's mood,  health,  and  even  the  weather  (e.g.,  sinus headaches  triggered  by  weather conditions).\nSome  of  the  resistance  to  hypnosis,  however,  is  attributable  to  the  quality  of  the clinician's suggestions, specifically how well they match the client's experience (Zeig & Rennick, 1991). If I give a client a suggestion to feel his or her muscles relaxing, and he or she isn't experiencing that sensation, then my suggestion does not fit with his or her experience and is easily rejected. To impose arbitrary suggestions on a client that he or she experience something you want him or her to experience (e.g., arm levitation) that has  little  relationship  to  what  he  or  she  is  experiencing  or  wants  to  experience  is  a legitimate basis for him or her choosing not to follow your suggestion. Furthermore, your client  may  be  in  so  comfortable  a  state  of  mind  and  body  that  your  suggestions  for specific responses, simple as they may seem, are too much a strain for him or her. Even beyond  that,  your  client  may  be  giving  him-  or  herself  suggestions  that  are  more meaningful than yours! Why shouldn't the client be free to have that experience without being deemed 'resistant'?\nHypnosis increases, rather than descreases, the range of a person's control. Suggestions that  don't  fit  well,  by  mismatching  experience  or  by  placing  too  much  demand  on  the person, can be and usually are rejected. A clinician can offer possibilities to the client, and can respond respectfully to the choices the client makes. To expect unquestioning obedience on the part of the client is wholly inappropriate in the clinical context, where collaboration in the service of therapeutic goals is vital.",

        "text": "Resistance  to  the  aims  of  therapy  has  an  extensive  overlap  with  the  dynamics  of resistance to hypnosis. Such resistance may be manifested by such contrary behaviors as appointments being missed, cancelled, or arrived at tardily. Assigned tasks ('homework') not being carried out, setting up a 'power struggle' with the therapist for control of the relationship,  clock-watching,  frequent  interrupting,  terminating  treatment  prematurely, over-cooperation, inappropriate gift-giving, and requests for special favors may be further evidence of treatment blocks.\nOrigins  of  resistance  to  the  aims  of  treatment  can  be  numerous.  Blocks  may  arise because  of  the  client's  intrapsychic  conflicts,  that  is,  ambivalences,  that  have  been described  in  detail  in  analytic  writings,  particularly  in  the  realm  of  object-relations theory. They may arise because of the fear of change, since for many people change is considered  a  risky,  scary  process  of  giving  up  the  known  for  the  uncertainty  of  the unknown.  Small  changes  can  gradually  give  rise  to  big  changes  in  one's  life,  and  for many  that  is  a  frightening  prospect.  The  reluctance  to  let  go  of the old, albeit dysfunctional, but familiar is a classic sign of resistance.\nFor this reason, the clinician, in order to intervene successfully, needs to understand the impact of the client's symptom(s) on his or her world. Symptoms can be viewed as a metaphor, or symbol, of the person's experience. They reflect limitations the person is experiencing in relating flexibly to the world around him or her. And, symptoms have consequences: They affect the client's self-image, social network, behavioral possibilities, emotional  realm,  physiology,  and  spiritual  makeup.  Sometimes  these consequences are deeply connected to the symptom's reason for being, and sometimes they're merely fallout. To attempt removal of a symptom without appreciating its role in the  person's  universe,  though,  is  potentially  hazardous.  Symptoms  may  even  serve protective  functions  at  times,  and  the  client's  holding  on  to  symptoms  may  look  like resistance,  but  the  resistance  to  the  clinician's  efforts  is  merely  a  side  effect.  Teaching better coping, that is, without symptoms, is obviously necessary, and becomes a clearer therapeutic goal when the protective function of the symptom is understood.\nResistance  to  therapeutic  progress  may  also  be  attributed  to  the  type  of  intervention employed  if  it  involves  strategies  and  maneuvers  that  are  unacceptable  to  the  client. Furthermore,  if  the  clinician  is  working  at  a  faster  or  slower  rate  than  the  client, resistance  can  surface.  Resistance  may  also  arise  from  negative  feelings  toward  the clinician, or their opposite-that is, idealized, romantic feelings that place a clinician on a pedestal he or she must inevitably fall from. Finally, contextual variables play a role as well,  including  such  factors  as  environmental  conditions,  client  disposition  and  health, and  so  forth.  It  should  be  apparent  that  all  the  sensitivity  that  goes  into  performing effective  hypnosis  is  just  a  part  of  the  larger  therapeutic  picture,  for  all  the  same guidelines apply.

His contributions to the clinical world\nare profound in helping us to understand problems in interpersonal terms and in  stressing  the  need  to  intervene  actively  and  strategically  for  our  clients' benefit.\nDr. Haley  has  written 19  books  on  therapy,  including Strategies of Psychotherapy, The Power Tactics of Jesus Christ, and perhaps his most wellknown  work, Uncommon Therapy .  It  was  this  latter  book  that  rocketed  the innovative nature of Milton Erickson's strategic approaches into the forefront of systemic thinking, and simultaneously revealed the crispness and incisiveness of Dr. Haley's thinking about the complex process of psychotherapy.  It  remains  'must'  reading  for  clinicians.  Dr.  Haley's  work continues  as  he  and  his  wife,  the  anthropologist  and  filmmaker  Madeleine Richeport-Haley, Ph.D., work on producing training videos on therapy.\nDr. Haley was the co-founder of the Family Therapy Institute of Washington, D.C., he was a research associate at Stanford University and the Mental Research Institute, and he was the founding editor of Family Process . He  is  the  first  recipient  of  the  Lifetime  Achievement  Award  of  the  Milton H.Erickson  Foundation,  which  also  held  a Festschrift in  his  honor  in  1999. The many papers and accolades offered in Dr. Haley's honor were published in a volume edited by Jeffrey Zeig called Changing Directives: The Strategic Therapy  of Jay Haley . In recognition of his lifelong contributions to humankind, Dr. Haley was awarded an honorary doctorate in June 2002 by Alliant International University in San Diego.\nDr.  Haley  is  a  modest  man  with  some  strong  opinions.  His  dry  wit  and ability  to  sense  and  articulate  the  ironies  of  the  therapy  business  are  simply unparalleled.\nO n Types of Hypnosis: 'I tend to think of three different hypnoses: (1) the personal  hypnosis,  where  you  go  through  a  yoga  experience  or  meditation experience, or whatever; (2) research hypnosis, where you're trying to find the limits of influence of hypnosis in various ways-in terms of deafness, colorblindness,  or  whatever;  and,  (3)  clinical  hypnosis,  where  you're  trying  to change someone-and I don't think that has anything to do with the other two hypnoses…  It's  so  different  changing  someone;  the  person's  motivation  is different, the responses are different.'*\nO n Hypnosis and Double-Binds: 'In hypnosis we found the first doublebind. (Gregory) Bateson had this idea of the double-bind, but we couldn't find\none. And I remember when I realized that a hypnotist was directing a person to  behave  spontaneously-that  was  the  double-bind,  a  classical  paradoxical conflict.'*\nO n  Defining  Problems  in  Social  Terms: 'I  think  a  lot  happened  in  the 1950s. Therapy became more social and began to change and trans\nform. Things are still changing, and we are still exploring. I think the most important idea that came in this (20th) century was that the individual wasn't the appropriate unit of study, rather it's the individual and others together. As Gregory Bateson said, 'The mind is outside the person.'**\nO n  Defining  Problems  in  Biological  Terms: 'I'm  not  an  enthusiast  for attributing so much to an individual's biochemistry. I think that is important for certain problems, but I think that the overselling of medications is one of the  worst  problems  in  the  field,  and  it  is  getting  worse  all  the  time.  Some psychiatrists now don't even seem able to talk to people-they only listen to decide which medications to prescribe. It's a shame.'**\nO n  Family  Therapy  Today: 'I  think  the  state  of  family  therapy  is  still developing, but it still has a number of people trying to haul it back into an individual theory. I think the problem is that most teachers are still trained in doing individual therapy and they try to draft the theories of family therapy to fit an individual model.'**\nO n the Diversity of Therapies: 'I think we have been too lenient in many ways.  One  of  the  problems  is  that  there  is  no  longer  any  orthodoxy  in  the field. When there is no orthodoxy, you can't be a deviant. So, what used to be condemned as deviance years ago is not being condemned now. If they do something a little different in therapy, they immediately form a school with powers of influence, rather  than  saying  it  is  just  one  more  technique  that  a therapist should be able to use when necessary.'**\nO n 'Impossible' Cases: 'Well, I can't think of one. Certainly, not on the basis  of  any  category,  because  the  category  isn't  the  person.  And  you're dealing with the person-not a set of ideas… If you're a competent therapist, you're going to win some and lose some. It doesn't mean they're incurable, it just means you haven't found a way to cure them!'*\nO n  His  Most  Significant  Contribution: 'I  think  my  most  significant contribution  is  breaking  therapy  down  to  a  practice  of  specific  skills-of simple  ideas,  skills  and  techniques.  This  is  quite  different  from  the  nondirective ideology the field had when I first got into it.'**\nSources: *Personal communication, 1988\n**Personal communication, 1999 Note: Full transcripts of Michael Yapko's interviews with Jay Haley are published in Changing Directives: The Strategic Therapy of Jay Haley (Zeig, 2001) .",

        "text": "How to deal with communication deemed 'resistant' is, of course, a function of how you conceptualize it. How you define resistance and who you reflexively assign responsibility for it to will determine whether you tend to view resistance as a property of the client, a property of the clinician, or an interactional outcome of the two. Listed in Table 21 below are some of the many ways to respond to resistance.\nAccepting  resistance  as  a  valid  communication  from  the  client  prevents  having  to ascribe blame to one or the other person in the relationship. More important, it paves the way  to  elevate  the  relationship  to  a  new  level  of  collaboration  through  what  Milton Erickson called the 'utilization of resistance' (Erickson, Rossi, & Rossi, 1976; Erickson & Rossi, 1979). Erickson's unique perspective on resistance makes a great deal of sense. Better  yet,  it works by  diffusing  and  re-directing  people's  resistance  to  hypnosis  and therapy.\nThe basic utilization formula of 'accept and utilize' applies here. In practice, it takes the  form  of  being  able  to  skillfully accept the  client's  response  as  a  valid  one  while developing a way to utilize the response in service of further suggestions. For example, if Erickson was performing an arm levitation on someone, offering suggestions for his or her arm becoming lighter and lighter, and the person reports experiencing his or her arm as getting heavier and heavier, Erickson would say something like, 'That's right, that's fine,  and  your  arm  can  get  heavier  still.' By accepting the client's response as a valid one,  it  can  be  built  upon,  redefining  a  seemingly  resistant  behavior  as  a  cooperative behavior. If  the  goal  was  to  get  an  arm  levitation,  that  is,  a  sensory  alteration  in  the person's  arm,  then  a  'heavy  arm'  is  an  acceptable  alternative  in  the  same  realm  of response. It just wasn't a compliant one\nTable 21. Potential Responses to Resistance\nwith the clinician's arbitrary demand for a levitation. If the clinician defines everything the client does as cooperative, then where is the resistance? Finding a way to make the nonconforming behavior seem an asset to the person can also change the feeling he or she has attached to it in favorable ways (Gilligan, 1987).\nAnother technique for managing resistance is more of a preventative one: Employing process  suggestions,  that  is,  suggestions  without  specific  content.  By  not  asking  for  a specific  response  and  covering  all  the  possible  responses,  whatever  the  client  does  is cooperative. For example:\nYou can notice the temperature in one of your hands, and as you continue to breathe in and out at your own comfortable rate, you may notice how your hand becomes  warmer,  or  perhaps  cooler,  or  you  may  notice  how  the  temperature remains the same…\nThe person's hand is going to either get warmer, cooler, or stay the same. What other possibilities are there? Therefore, any response the client generates can be accepted and utilized as a cooperative one.\nErickson was of the belief that clients need to be able to resist directives in order to maintain  a  sense  of  autonomy,  rather  than  adopting  a  position  of  mere  obedience  to authority  (Erickson  &  Rossi,  1979;  Zeig,  1980).  Thus,  one  of  the  strategies  he  often employed  was  offering  the  client  multiple  directives  simultaneously  so  that  the  client could resist one and accept the others. For example, I may direct a client to, 'Sit down, close your eyes, uncross your legs, take a deep breath, focus on my voice, and remember\nan experience from childhood you can talk about.' By offering so many directives at the same time, the probability is I will get most or all of the desired responses. Even if the client resists one, I will have gotten the other responses and can re-suggest the other in a different form later if I care to.\nNotice  also  in  the  above  suggestions  the  phrase  '…an  experience…you  can  talk about.'  The  implication  to  the  client  is  that  he  or  she  can  refuse  to  talk  about  some experiences,  allowing  him  or  her  to  resist  telling  me  something  while  simultaneously following my guidelines.\nAnother  technique  for  managing  resistance  is  the  strategy  pioneering  family  and directive  therapist  Jay  Haley  (1973)  described  as  'encouraging  resistance.'  When  you encourage resistance, usually with an intentional use of negative suggestions, in order for the client to resist resisting, he or she must cooperate (sort of a 'reverse psychology'). For  example,  if  I'd  like  the  client  to  sit  down,  but  anticipate  that  a  straightforward directive to do so will be met with resistance, I can instead suggest:\nYou  don't  have  to  (pause) sit  down .  I  don't  expect you  can  make  yourself comfortable (embedded command) here. It will be much better for you to stand just as you are.\nBy encouraging him or her to resist sitting and remain standing, the person's resistance to me can now allow him or her to be seated. Either way, sitting or standing, the person's behavior is defined as cooperative (sitting is what I want him or her to do, standing is what I've directed him or her to do).\nResponding to a client's resistances in a way that is accepting and nonconfrontational requires  considerable  flexibility  and  respect  for  the  integrity  of  the  client.  Flexibility refers to the ability to have a variety of ways to get a point across without having to beat the client over the head with it. Flexibility means being willing to go the extra distance to meet  the  client  on  the  client's  level,  joining  his  or  her  reality  instead  of  expecting  or demanding  him  or  her  to  come  to  yours.  It  also  means  not  having  so  rigid  a  set  of expectations  and  procedures  that  your  approach  wouldn't  allow  for  unique,  individual responses.  You  can  see  a  sharp  division  on  this  point  between  different  schools  of hypnosis, given how some approaches emphasize the importance of invariant procedures as a means of assessing client differences.\nIt is important not to build resistance in your client by doing things the way you think they should be done with little or no regard for your client's expectations, beliefs, values, and  unique  talents.  If  you  attempt  a  strategy  that  fails  or  offer  a  suggestion  that  is responded to unfavorably, don't do the same thing over again a little more emphatically! Shift  your  approach  smoothly,  and  perhaps  even  compliment the  person's  resistance  if you care to comment on his or her ability to make effective choices in his or  her  own behalf. Then, do something different .\nNot  many  people  like  to  be  told  exactly  what  to  do,  so  commanding  someone  to respond  obediently,  as  in  direct  authoritarian  suggestions  (i.e.,  'You will do  this'), generally  encourages  resistance.  A  helpful  guideline  is  this: The  more  resistance  you anticipate getting or actually derive from the client, the greater the need for permissiveness and even indirection in your approach.

We spend so much of our lives trying  to  build  a  ritualized  pattern  of  behavior  so  as  to  expend  the  least  amount  of physical and mental energy, and after developing such a pattern we frequently complain of 'being stuck in a rut.'\nResistance doesn't always show up in detectable ways (some forms are so unconscious and subtle), and resistance can't always be used in the service of change. Some clients simply will not change, others only slightly. The discussion of resistance in this chapter is intended to present the idea that much of resistance which has usually been thought of as intra personal is actually inter personal, arising from a demanding, or somehow incompatible  approach  to  the  client.  Interventions  have  a  better  chance  of  succeeding when you are able to flexibly get a single point across in a number of different ways, using  the  feedback  from  each  unique  individual  you  treat  to  adapt  your  methods accordingly.",

        "text": "In  chapter  2,  I  addressed  common  misconceptions  about  hypnosis,  often  the  basis  for people's fear about hypnosis. One of the misconceptions I discussed briefly concerned the potential harm to a client undergoing treatment through hypnosis. I made the point then that hypnosis could be applied skillfully and helpfully, or it could be misused and potentially  cause  harm  to  the  client.  In  this  chapter,  I  will  consider  more  carefully  the hazards  associated  with  doing  hypnosis  that  make  it  absolutely  essential  to  exercise caution and sensitivity in its use.\nI  have  left  this  discussion  until  near  the  book's  end.  I  have  clearly  mentioned  many times the responsibilities a clinician has to a client, and the range of skills necessary to function competently and ethically. I have tried to inspire rather than frighten you with scary hypnosis stories. Are there such stories? Yes, there are. And when you hear them, you  will  likely  recognize  that  when  problems  have  arisen,  they  haven't  been  due  to hypnosis  itself,  but  rather  to  the  way  someone  who  was  either  ignorant  or  malicious applied it. I cannot emphasize this point enough.\nIt  is  the  measure  of  a  field's  maturity,  in  my  opinion,  when  it  can  perform  selfexaminations  with  an  openness  to  discovering  the  truth,  even  if  the  truth  isn't  all  that pleasant. Due  in large part to the repressed memory  controversy, the field of psychotherapy has had to come to terms with the reality that well intended psychotherapists can cause devastation to the lives of individuals and families. There is a much greater willingness to explore the issue of the untoward effects of bad therapy, and the increased effects of self-monitoring with greater objectivity is helping us realize the problems  in  other  domains  as  well,  such  as  the  negative  effects  of  over-medicating patients and the number of patients coming out of hospitals sicker than when they came in.\nThe field of hypnosis is maturing as well. Historically, the hazards of hypnosis were rarely  discussed,  and  when  they  were,  the  focus  was  a  narrow  one  on  the  issues  of whether hypnosis could be used to coerce people into engaging in antisocial behavior, and whether hypnosis would cause psychological harm to emotionally unstable people, perhaps precipitating suicide or a psychotic reaction in them (Frauman, Lynn, & Brentar, 1993; Kleinhauz & Eli, 1987; Stanley, 1994). More recently, the concerns about hypnosis have  become  more  diverse,  and  clinically  more  relevant  (Lynn,  Martin,  &  Frauman, 1996).  Generally,  the  reports  of  negative  effects  from  hypnosis  were  minor  ones occurring  very  rarely,  such  as  anxiety  or  panic  (Judd,  Burrows,  &  Dennerstein,  1985), difficulties in disengaging or re-orienting (Orne, 1965), and physical discomfort such as headache, dizziness, or nausea (Coe & Ryken, 1979; Hilgard, 1974). With such reports as these, and others that I will consider shortly, it is no wonder that hypnosis has seemed at least a little bit risky to some.\nAre these issues and reports something you should be concerned about? The answer is yes and no. Yes, there are potential hazards in doing hypnosis for you to be concerned and educated about. No, there is no evidence whatsoever that hypnosis causes psychosis, precipitates suicide, strips people of their defense, or otherwise harms people. There is a high  level of consensus  after all these years amongst  hypnosis  researchers  and practitioners that hypnosis holds no inherent dangers when used appropriately by a well trained clinician (Barber, 1995; Conn, 1981; Orne, 1965; Perry, 1990). The hazards that exist are identical to those that apply to conducting a clinical practice, and dealing with diverse, vulnerable people in distress. However, the greater intensity of the therapeutic alliance  hypnosis  affords  can  also  intensify  the  relationship  dynamics  between  a  client and  a  practitioner  (see  Barber,  1995,  for  an  excellent  discussion  of  the  interpersonal boundary issues in hypnosis), and between a client and him- or herself.\nThe relationship a client has with him- or herself, that is, his or her psychodynamics, coping  skills,  quality  of  thought,  and  so  on,  is  magnified  in  hypnosis  as  the  client's attention is focused inwardly on his or her issues, problems, symptoms, and other aspects of  his  or  her  subjective  world.  What  you  focus  on,  you  amplify.  Might  there  be  some negative effects as a result? Yes, and these are what require an advanced knowledge that comes from appropriate academic and clinical training.\nThe lack of a serious credentialing or licensure for hypnosis attesting to at least some minimal standards of training has been harmful to the reputation of hypnosis (Stanley, 1994). The evidence is simply too substantial that when misapplied, hypnosis can be a problem.  Paraphrasing  Martin  Orne  (1965),  the  guideline  should  be  that if  you're  not qualified  to  treat  the  problem without hypnosis,  then  you're  not  qualified  to  treat  the problem with hypnosis .\nThe potential hazards people most associate with hypnosis, rightly or wrongly, include: spontaneous  regressions  and  abreactions,  symptom  substitution,  confabulations,  and failure  to  remove  suggestions.  I  will  address  these  hazards  and  whether  and  how  each might  be  a  legitimate  concern.  Before  you  begin  to  fantasize  unspeakably  horrible possibilities, let me assure you of one thing: If you are aware and respectful of the innate integrity of your client, you will avoid the potential pitfalls.",

        "text": "The topic of this section represents the most common hazard of doing hypnosis, and it isn't a question of whether you will encounter it, but when . If you have been practicing your skills in hypnosis with different people, then you probably have had the experience of discovering that people respond in unexpected and even unusual ways even to the most straightforward,  seemingly  one-dimensional  hypnotic  suggestions. The  fact  that  people will  interpret  what  you  say  from  their  own  frame  of  reference,  and  will  therefore associate meanings to what you say that you never intended, is a given in doing clinical hypnosis. It's to be  expected,  planned  for,  accepted,  and  utilized.  Sometimes  the unexpected  responses  you  get  are  actually better than  what  you  had  hoped  for:  The person finds a simple word, phrase, or concept you mentioned deeply enlightening and transformative, and radiates that wonderful perception. When  that happens, it's\nwonderful . Other  times,  however,  the  unexpected  responses  you  get  are  almost  the opposite:  The  person  finds  something  you  said  offensive,  threatening,  insensitive,  or merely irrelevant. Sometimes it's because what you said really was offensive, threatening, insensitive, or irrelevant.\nMore  often,  though,  the  person's  association  to  what  you  said  was  unique  (i.e., idiosyncratic),  and  simply  couldn't  have  been  predicted  by  you  or  anyone  else.  For example, you might offer suggestions for the purpose of inducing hypnosis employing imagery, meant to be soothing, of being at the beach. As the person begins the process of relaxing, he or she nearly has a panic attack, simply because you didn't know that he or she had nearly drowned in the ocean as a young child. And that's even after you had the foresight to ask, 'So, would it be all right to begin this process by having you focus on relaxing at the beach?' and the person replied, 'Yes, that's fine.' Could the person really have forgotten that drowning episode, only to have it come up seemingly out of nowhere as you start to do hypnosis? Yes.\nMemories can come up through structured age regression sessions, but most often they simply  arise  spontaneously  for  people  during  hypnosis,  hence  the  term  'spontaneous regression.' That's natural and to be expected. After all, the events in a person's personal history  have  shaped  their  very  lives.  Sometimes  the  memories  are  pleasant  ones,  but sometimes what comes up are unpleasant memories that surface dramatically and with considerable emotional intensity (Fromm, 1980; Lynn, Kirsch, & Rhue, 1996). These are termed 'abreactions.'\nThe terms 'spontaneous regression' and 'abreaction' are not synonymous terms, but rather  are  so  closely  related  in  their  association  that  I  have  chosen  to  discuss  them together in this section. Together, these two account for the unexpected and often intense emotionalism that potentially makes hypnosis powerful in shaping the client's experience.  When  the  emotions  are  positive  and  bring  pleasure,  it's  not  much  of  a concern to clinicians. But when the feelings are painful, involving hurt, grief, fear, rage, or  whatever,  the  need  for  the  clinician  to  know  how  to  skillfully  and  therapeutically manage such feelings cannot be overstated (Lynn, Kirsch, & Rhue, 1996).\nA spontaneous regression back to some unpleasant memory is an indicator of what is commonly called 'unfinished business,' personally significant experiences which didn't reach an adequate resolution and thus require further attention. Sometimes the suppression or repression of significant memories is so great that the material remains out of consciousness even during hypnosis and instead of there being an overt abreaction, the person complains of a headache or some such discomfort during or after hypnosis.\nEven  the  most  skilled  clinician  cannot  know  what  land  mines  are  in  the  client's unconscious waiting be tripped in doing therapy or hypnosis. What seems like a neutral term to one person may be the trigger to some intense personal experience for another. Therefore, the possibility of doing hypnosis without ever experiencing an abreaction is unlikely. Be ready by having good training in handling intense affect, the kind of training you are most likely to receive in advanced clinical workshops on working with people who have endured traumas of one sort or another.\nSome  clinicians,  on  the  other  hand,  actually  instigate  abreactions  in  their  clients  in order to deliberately bring painful memories up and attempt to resolve them therapeutically.  This  can  be  an  invaluable  treatment  strategy  if  done  skillfully.  If  done\npoorly,  it  can  place  the  already  vulnerable  client  in  greater  emotional  distress,  not  to mention wasting an opportunity to do some real healing. If a clinician is uncomfortable in dealing with strong emotional associations that may be triggered by what was originally intended to be the most soothing of hypnotic experiences, the choice exists to either get comfortable or avoid doing any work of real emotional impact (i.e., doing therapy in an entirely detached, intellectual style).\nAbreactions can manifest themselves in a variety of ways, including crying, hyperventilation, trembling of the body (or specific body parts), premature disengagement from hypnosis, hallucinations, delusions, and autistic-like rocking motions. Each of the above behaviors is not automatically indicative of an abreaction, but should be responded to cautiously and sensitively. Any sign of discomfort on the part of the client signals a need for you to clarify what's going on with him or her. 'Checking in' with the client as I have encouraged you to do many times is a good thing to do anyway, since one of the things well established through the research of Sheehan and McConkey (Sheehan,  1992;  Sheehan  &  McConkey,  1982)  is  that  someone  can  report  being distressed even while maintaining an outward appearance of seeming  calm  and comfortable.\nThe first and foremost thing to remember in dealing with spontaneous regressions and abreactions is this: You can feel comfortable directly asking your client to describe his or her experience. Give protective suggestions, and be supportive of his or her experience, using the general 'accept and utilize' formula. Allow the abreaction, but be calming and helpful  to  the  client  in  helping  him  or  her  reach  a  new  perspective  on  the  experience. (After all,  that's  what  therapy  is  for,  isn't  it?  One  can't  change  the  past,  only  attitudes toward it.) Use calming suggestions, make sure your voice is soothing and confident, and move in a casual way as opposed to abrupt, rapid movements. In general, the best thing you can do is use hypnosis to resolve the situation and attain some closure. You do that by first  supporting  the  emotional  release,  and  then  guiding  the  client's  attention  in  the direction of considering new perspectives, developing necessary coping and transcending resources, and helping the person to integrate them. Even if your client's hour is up, your responsibility to that person isn't over. Make certain he or she can leave in a collected manner.\nThe specifics of how to do all that are beyond the scope of this introductory text, so I again encourage you to take more advanced clinical training with experts in this domain. If a client opens up with some sensitive information that you are simply not equipped to handle  for  whatever  reason,  I  suggest  that  you  make  sure  the  client  is  immediately referred to an appropriate helping professional (thus the value of a good referral list). A suggestion such as the following may be employed in such instances:\n… And you've become aware now of some feelings that are very strong and some memories that are needing some attention…and you can know comfortably that as these images and feelings drift into your awareness that they can  be  handled  skillfully  and  that  you  can  help  yourself  by  keeping  this information in a safe place within you until they can be brought out with the person best  able  to  help  you  with  them,  and  so  you  can  let  these  images  and feelings drift to the safe place within you until you are ready to share them when\nthe time is right….\nEssentially,  the  suggestions  above  are  telling  the  client  that  he  or  she  can  'put  the information  away  safely  for  now  and  deal  with  it  later'  in  a  context  that  is  more appropriate. Such protective suggestions can have a very soothing effect on the person, and  can  build  even  greater  trust  for  your  open  acknowledgment  of  your  limits  in intervening.  Follow-up  to  make  sure  the  person  gets  in  to  see  someone  qualified  right away is critically important, as is staying aware of and supporting his or her overall wellbeing.",

        "text": "Historically, the most common criticism leveled against the use of hypnosis concerned the potential for 'symptom substitution.' Symptom substitution refers to the onset of a new symptom,  perhaps,  but  not  necessarily  a  worse  one,  in  the  place  of  the  old  symptom removed during treatment. For example, Rosen (1960) reported that one patient treated with hypnosis to relieve phantom limb pain later developed schizoaffective disorder, and another patient treated for smoking developed overeating and then alcoholism. He did not provide  assessment  data  or  the  specifics  of  his  treatment  plan,  so  we  do  not  know  if hypnosis had anything to do with his patients' difficulties.\nIn  order  for  one  to  charge  hypnosis  with  this  potential  liability,  hypnosis  must  be viewed  as  a  symptomatic  treatment  as  opposed  to  a  more  dynamic  or  depth-oriented approach. The dynamic theory is that there is a psychic energy associated with internal conflicts that is relieved by the development of a symptom-an outlet for the energy. By removing the outlet, the energy must be re-directed elsewhere and a new outlet developed (Weitzenhoffer, 2000). Other 'symptomatic' approaches, most notably behaviorism, have faced this same charge.\nIn  the  case  of  hypnosis,  there  is  a  twist  that  makes  the  response  to  the  criticism somewhat  complex.  Hypnosis can be  used  superficially  and  symptomatically  (scripted approaches,  for  example),  and,  in  my  opinion,  is  used  this  way  all  too  often.  Simple, direct  suggestion  aimed  at  a  target  symptom  can  be  used  by  untrained  laypeople  and poorly trained professionals with no real understanding of the deeper issues presented in this chapter in particular and this book in general. There have been many times, especially in these later chapters, I have encouraged making the distinction between the content of a person's problem and its underlying structure, encouraging you to address the structure. Furthermore, without an understanding of the role of a symptom in a person's life and the related  dynamics,  symptom  substitution  can  be  (but  isn't  necessarily)  an  unwanted, unexpected outcome.\nThe primary issues associated with the potential for unwanted symptom substitution are first, a symptom's function ( if it has one, and it is not safe to assume it always does), and second, the associated secondary gains, if any.\nThe  idea  of  a  symptom  frequently,  but  not  always,  serving  a  useful  purpose  even though it may be uncomfortable to a person is probably not a difficult idea to grasp. To view it as a way of coping, a way of controlling others, a way of getting what one wants,\na way of avoiding responsibility, and a way of maintaining a stable position in an erratic world  are  all  ways  of  giving  the  symptom  a  special  respect  for  its  value  instead  of derogating  it  as  stupid  and  meaningless  (Frauman,  Lynn,  &  Brentar,  1993).  If  the function or value of a symptom is not considered, how is that same need in the person to be managed more constructively through the therapeutic alternatives you provide?\nHere's a personal example of the point: In the psychiatric hospitals I have worked in, the staffs did something I considered to be a bit odd. It is a purely subjective estimate on my part  that  98.36%  of  psychiatric  patients  are  cigarette  smokers  and  most  are  chainsmokers (only a slight  exaggeration).  Cigarettes  entertain  them  in  what  can  often  be  a boring environment, they are a medium of exchange in the patient barter system, they are a  status  symbol,  but  mostly  they  just  help  the  patients  manage  their  anxiety  by  giving them a series of temporary focal points. Staff members, noticing the value of cigarettes, often use them for leverage to get the patients to do whatever the staff wants them to do. 'Difficult' patients lose their smoking privilege and must earn the right to smoke. This ploy works enough times to keep it going, but some patients don't react well to it: A short time after the cigarettes are taken, the patient ends up in seclusion for 'acting out.' This is  what  I  mean  when  I  talk  about  the  value  of  a  symptom.  In  this  example,  cigarette smoking  is  not  just  a  bad  habit-it's  the  glue  holding  the  fragile  patient  together. Removing an outlet and providing no better alternative can lead to rapid deterioration. Of course, the patient teaches the staff not to do that again. In emotionally healthier people, this  process  is  not  nearly  as  extreme,  but  a  similar  potential  exists.  The  idea  of responsible  treatment  is  to  acknowledge  the  function  of  the  symptom  and  to  develop alternatives that will satisfy the underlying dynamics in a more constructive way.\nClosely related is the issue of 'secondary gain.' Secondary gain refers to the 'payoff' for  a  symptom,  that  is,  the  advantages  the  symptom  allows  the  person.  The  payoff  is rarely, if ever, a conscious one. Rather, it is an unconscious system which supports the symptom's existence. Realistically, the symptom has an impact on the person's personal and  interpersonal  worlds,  including  his  or  her  family,  friends,  spouse,  therapist,  and whoever else might be in the sphere of the symptom's influence. If the impact is one that encourages the  symptom, the  symptom is  easier  to  maintain.  In  fact,  one  of  the  better strategic approaches to addressing secondary gains is making the symptom inconvenient, that is, making it easier to give the symptom up than to keep it. I described this pattern previously in chapter 18. Haley described a similar approach in detail in his 1984 book, Ordeal Therapy .\nSymptom substitution need not occur if the client is educated about treatment, and if the  symptom's  purpose(s)  and  secondary  gain(s),  if  any,  are  identified  and  resolved within the treatment process. Whether these issues should be presented to the client as 'insights' or not (perhaps choosing to address them indirectly) is a matter of professional orientation and clinical judgment. It is impressive, though, that Barabasz and Sheehan in an unpublished 1983 study (reported in Barabasz & Barabasz, 1992) obtained data from over 600 patients treated on a hypnosis and psychosomatic medicine unit in a hospital and had only one patient report mild, transient difficulties associated with his treatment. Their conclusion, which I support, is that psychoeducation and psychological evaluations (including mental status exams)  overwhelmingly  precluded  negative effects from hypnosis (Barabasz & Barabasz, 1992).\nIf  symptom  substitution  should  arise  for  some  reason,  the  new  symptom  can  be addressed more directly in terms of its origin, purpose, secondary gains, and meaning to the client. It can be removed through suggestion, through techniques like age progression, or Bandler and Grinder's 'ecology check' (1979), described below.\nAge progression was discussed in detail in chapter 16. Suffice it to say here that taking the  client  forward  in  time  (through  fantasy  projection)  allows  the  person  to  assess realistically the impact of the proposed changes. Such assessment consists of evaluating whether  alleviation  of  the  symptom  has  been  helpful  or  hurtful,  and  in  what  specific ways.\nThe  'ecology  check'  is  a  more  sophisticated  technique  based  on  the  systemic perspective that each person is composed of multiple, interrelated parts. A change in one part  of  the  person  is  necessarily  going  to  have  an  impact  on  the  other  parts,  hopefully positive, but perhaps not. The 'ecology check' is a way to gauge the client's perspective on  the  impact  of  the  symptom's  removal.  The  check  essentially  involves  establishing direct communication, verbal or otherwise, with the client in hypnosis, having him or her implement  the  change  under  consideration,  and  noticing  the  changes  that  result  in  the person's  experience  as  a  consequence.  Specifically,  the  person  is  directed  to  notice whether the change is an acceptable one at all levels. If so, the person is asked whether the  part  of  him  or  her  that  was  formerly  responsible  for  the  old  symptom  can  now  be responsible for integrating the new alternative(s) provided in treatment into the desired context. (See Bandler & Grinder, 1979, for a more detailed description and examples.)\nAs a final point, there may be occasions when symptom substitution may be a desirable alternative as a deliberate part of the treatment plan. In other words, intentionally creating an  'acceptable'  symptom  may  be  a  choice  a  clinician  and  client  make  together. Channeling a client's physical pain from one part of his or her body and concentrating it in  his  or  her  little  finger,  for  example,  may  be  a  desirable  alternative  for  the  patient (Chaves, 1993).\nDeveloping an appreciation for the complexity of these therapeutic issues will facilitate not only clinical hypnosis in particular, but therapeutic intervention in general. The issue of symptom substitution associated with the use of hypnosis has declined in recent years as  clinicians  better  under-stand  treatment  dynamics as  well as  the  dynamics  of  clinical hypnosis. Not only is symptom substitution not inevitable, it should be regarded as a rare phenomenon.",

The material projected into the memory gap  is  called  a  confabulation  (Schachter,  1996).  Confabulations  may  be  self-\ngenerated, or they may be suggested memories that are incorporated as real. In the course of hypnosis, when the lines separating fantasy from reality may be even more blurred, the danger is increased that someone will mistake a confabulation for truth. This misperception  can  be  a  problem  in  therapy  at  any  time,  but  it  has  been  an  especially serious one as clinicians struggle with the issue of how to best address the population of people who may have abuse (whether sexual, physical, or emotional) in their background. Such individuals may suffer a variety of memory problems as a direct result of the trauma (Spiegel,  1993,  1996).  Gaps  in  memory  may  even  be  taken  by  some  clinicians  as evidence  of  abuse  when  in  fact  no  such  memories  exist  and  there  was  no  such  actual history (Belli & Loftus, 1994; Lynn & Nash, 1994; Yapko, 1994).\nThere is a general sequence in the development of false memories when the therapist is the source of the contamination. First, the client has distressing symptoms of unknown origin he or she presents to a therapist. The therapist believes and then directly suggests to the client that the symptoms are evidence of a history of abuse. The client denies any such abuse took place, which the therapist then uses as confirming evidence that there was abuse and that it is repressed. Next, the therapist suggests that the 'root causes' of the  symptoms  must  be  brought  to  the  surface  for  resolution,  even  suggesting  that remembering and 'working through' the memories is essential to recovery. The therapist is  sincere,  persuasive,  and seen  as  a  credible  expert.  So,  the  client  agrees  to  undergo  a memory recovery  process  of  one  sort  or  another  (perhaps  called  hypnosis,  or  perhaps called  by  other  names  such  as  imagery,  visualization,  primary  processing,  etc.).  The client undergoes the process, the holes in his or her memory become especially evident to both the clinician and him- or herself (e.g., 'I can't remember!'). The therapist frames this  inability  to  remember  as  resistance  ('You  have  to  face  this  even  though  it's painful!')  and  'helpfully'  suggests  details  of  abuse  (e.g.,  'Notice  where  your  father  is putting his hands…don't you feel terribly violated and angry?') which the person comes to believe actually happened. A new identity, that of an 'abuse survivor,' is born.\nIt bears repeating that this terrible scenario is most likely to occur when the therapist is the  one  to  suggest  the  memories  of  abuse  as  a  means  of  helping  the  client  explain symptoms and fill in memory gaps. This is a minority of cases, since most people who have  been  abused  know  it  now  and  have  always  known  it .  They  might  not  ever  have talked to anyone about it before, but they have known about it. Repression to the point of a full amnesia for abuse is possible, but it is a most uncommon phenomenon.\nThe  means  to  avoid  making  the  mistakes  associated  with  the  suggested  memory problem should be obvious: Don't infer a history of abuse where none is stated, don't offer leading suggestions to a client in hypnosis about what and how to remember, don't assume a 'root cause' for every problem, do know the workings of human memory, do know the limits of hypnosis, do know that memories can be detailed and emotional and still  be  wrong,  and  be  clear  about  the  distinction  between  supporting  versus  validating your client's memories (Loftus & Yapko, 1995; Lynn, Kirsch, & Rhue, 1996).\nBe reminded, there is no technology currently available to distinguish between truth and confabulation. No clinician doing hypnosis should hold the terribly erroneous belief that hypnosis will reveal the truth.",

        "text": "A  common  fear  expressed  to  me  by  students  new  to  the  field  concerns  the  failure  to remove  suggestions.  With  all  the  things  there  are  to  occupy  your  mind  while  doing hypnosis (formulating meaningful suggestions while closely observing and utilizing your client's responses), what happens if you forget to remove a suggestion? Will your client stay age-regressed indefinitely? Will your client stay anesthetized and live life 'comfortably numb'? The answer is no. But why isn't the failure to remove suggestions a serious concern?\nActually, it is a serious concern. It is possible that a suggestion may have a delayed or hidden effect, and so your suggestions to the client, if meant to be temporary, should be structured to say that they are temporary. André Weitzenhoffer has probably written the most about this phenomenon, and described the issue clearly when he wrote:\nIt is not well-recognized that when the response to a suggestion is not allowed to  be  completed  or  is  prevented  from  taking  place  there  may  be  a  lingering effect that may unexpectedly manifest itself sometime in the fu-ture. Furthermore, while it is usually assumed that if a response does not take place, this  indicates  the  suggestion  had  no  effect,  this  can  be  a  quite  erroneous conclusion.  A  related  effect  may  take  place  also  unexpectedly  at  some  future time.  While  this  may  not  be  a  frequent  occurrence,  it  does  occur.  For  this reason, I terminate or annul any suggestion that I do not plan to have an ongoing effect. (2000, pp. 53-4)\nWhile Weitzenhoffer acknowledged it is rare for a suggestion to linger beyond the time it is  needed,  his  advice  to  deliberately  annul  suggestions  is  wise.  Why  are  hypnotic responses generally temporary? Because they are 'state specific' (Rossi, 1996, 2002). In other words, they are operative only as long as the person is in hypnosis. There is little or no  carryover  of  the  hypnotically  obtained  responses  into  the  client's  'waking'  state unless there has been a suggestion to do so.\nYou may remember that the purpose  of  the  posthypnotic  suggestion  is  to  allow  the responses obtained during hypnosis  to generalize to other contexts. Without  the posthypnotic suggestion (either from the client to him- or herself or from the clinician) to carry the hypnotic response over to some other context, the response is just an interesting one  observable  only  temporarily  during  hypnosis.  Thus,  if  you  forget  to  remove suggestions given during hypnosis at the end of the hypnosis session, the suggestion is highly likely to dissipate automatically upon disengagement.\nIf the exception occurs and the client continues to experience a suggestion that was not intended  posthypnotically,  it  is  a  safe  bet  the  client  has  given  him-  or  herself  the posthypnotic  suggestion  to  do  so  (perhaps  by  simply  assuming  the  suggestion  was supposed to endure). Hypnosis may be reinduced and the suggestion directly removed if so desired.\nAnother  possibility  to  consider  in  such  instances  is  that  the  suggestion  might  have some  special  significance  to  the  client  or  he  or  she  would  not  have  maintained  it.\nHypnosis  may  be  re-induced  in  order  to  explore  its  significance.  Suggestions  are generally followed only as long as they are appropriate, that is, beneficial.\nThe  point  to  remember  is  that  any  suggestion  can  be  accepted  or  rejected,  and  the maintenance  of  a  suggestion  not  intended  to  exist  outside  of  the  hypnotic  experience represents a choice at some level by the client. Suggestions will most probably dissipate on disengaging from hypnosis, but in the exception where this does not occur, the client may  be  re-hypnotized  and  the  suggestion  removed  in  whatever  manner  is  deemed appropriate.\nIt bears repeating that the best way to avoid any of the potential hazards described in this section of the chapter is by respecting the integrity of each person, regardless of their symptoms, age, or background. I can think of no one who models this attitude better than one of the field's most well respected experts, and one of its best voices of conscience, Dr. Karen Olness. (Continued on page 551.)",

        "text": "Karen Olness, M.D., (1936-) is professor of pediatrics, Family Medicine and International Health at Case Western Reserve University. She is also director of Rainbow Center for International Child Health. Dr. Olness has specialized in pediatric medicine since receiving her medical degree from the University of  Minnesota  in  1961.  Actually,  she  chose  her  specialty  much  earlier,  first declaring at age 6 that she wanted to be a doctor. Later, at age 12 she wrote an essay titled, 'Why I Want to Be a Pediatrician.' Her dedication to the needs of children has been extraordinary, serving as president of the Northwestern Pediatric  Society  and  as  president  of  the  Society  for  Developmental  and Behavioral Pediatrics.\nDr. Olness has had a long-time interest in clinical hypnosis, and her work in  the  field  has  been  highly  visible  and  influential,  especially  through  her classic  text, Hypnosis  and  Hypnotherapy  with  Children, now  in  its  third edition  and  co-authored  with  pediatrician  Daniel  Kohen,  M.D.  (Guilford Press,  1996).  She  is  also  the  author  of  the  book Raising  Happy  Children (Meadowbrook Press, 1977), as well as more than 50 articles and nearly two dozen  book  chapters.  She  is  the  incoming  president  of  the  International Society of Hypnosis, and she is a past president of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis  (ASCH),  the  Society  for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis (SCEH), and the American Board of Medical Hypnosis. I can think of  no  one  who  is  more  knowledgeable  in  the  applications  of  hypnosis  with children.\nEven  more  remarkable  than  her  many  professional  accomplishments  are her many humanitarian contributions. Dr. Olness is medical director and cofounder of Health Frontiers, a volunteer faculty outreach in international child health. Through Health Frontiers and other humanitarian organizations (such as  the  International  Rescue  Committee)  she  has  helped  set  up  a  pediatric\nresidency program  in Laos, helped support HIV  research in Uganda, consulted  to  faculty  in  Turkey  regarding  the  effects  of  earthquakes  on children, helped in Albania with Kosovo refugees, helped in El Salvador with hurricane  survivors,  and  helped  refugees  in  Rwanda  and  Afghanistan.  She brings  a  strength  and  kindness  to  the  field  that  is  exceedingly  rare  and precious.\nDr.  Olness  has  been  recognized  for  her  remarkable  efforts  with  many honors and awards. She has received the Outstanding Physician Award from the Minnesota Association of Women  in  Medicine, the Aldrich and Christopherson  Awards from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Distinguished Service Award from the International Health Medical Education  Consortium.  Recently,  Dr.  Olness  was  elected  to  the  Cleveland Medical Hall of Fame, and named one of the Distinguished Women in\nHealth  Care  in  Cleveland.  She  may  belong  to  Cleveland,  but  she  is  world class.\nO n how the field of hypnosis has changed since the late '60s, when she began using hypnosis: 'I think that induction techniques are less authoritative.  It  is  encouraging  that  there  has  been  substantial  research  to document physiological changes (including brain changes) and mechanisms associated  with  hypnosis.  In  spite  of  this,  there  do  not  seem  to  be  greater numbers  of  health  professionals  who  study  or  use  hypnosis.  For  example, membership in both the  ASCH  and  the  SCEH  is  substantially  less  than  20 years  ago.  On  the  other  hand,  some  other  professional  organizations  have developed  regular  hypnosis  workshops,  and  there  are  more  articles  about hypnosis  published  in  nonhypnosis  journals.  Nurses  are  using  hypnosis  in increasing  numbers  and  doing  a  great  deal  of  research  using  hypnosis; however they call hypnosis guided imagery or visualization.'\nO n what any student new to the field of hypnosis should know about doing hypnosis with children: 'It  is  fun  to  work  with children. It is also a joy to give them the gift of self-hypnosis and to follow them over years. I now hear  from  adults  in  their  twenties  and  thirties  who  still  use  their  selfregulation skills, acquired when they were young children. I believe that all children  with  chronic  conditions  such  as  hemophilia,  cancer,  diabetes,  and sickle cell disease should have the opportunity to learn self-hypnosis as soon as possible after the diagnosis is established.'\nO n  implications  of  her  research  in  which  schoolchildren  used  selfhypnosis  to  change  immune  responses,  including  both  humoral  and cellular responses: 'Dr. Hewson Bower in Australia repeated our work and took  it  into  the  clinical  realm.  Her  carefully  done  thesis  demonstrated  that children  who  learn  and  practice  self-hypnosis  have  reduced  numbers  of respiratory  infections,  and  fewer  days  of  illness  when  they  do  contract  a respiratory  infection.  There  is  substantial  evidence  that  various  stressors\nsuppress immune responses. It would seem a good idea to teach all children how to use self-hypnosis to cope with stress.'\nO n how average children can use hypnosis to change the temperature in  their  fingertips  or  their  electrodermal  activity: 'There  are  now  many monitoring  systems,  ranging  from  a  bioband  which  cost  a  few  dollars  to biofeedback units costing thousands of dollars. Both children and adults enjoy seeing graphic evidence of their ability to control body responses. In general, I use a biofeedback monitor\nwhen  teaching  children  self-hypnosis,  as  an  adjunct,  to  encourage  them  to recognize their own self-control.'\nO n the evolution of her 'mind body machine' for children: 'I had long had the idea that it  would be helpful if there could be an easy way to give young  children  an  experience  which  would  make  it  clear  that  'thinking changes  body  responses.'  Ten  years ago  we  developed  a  touchscreen computer program which is driven by a sensor that measures galvanic skin resistance. This unit was in the Cleveland Health Museum until just recently when the museum closed for major renovations. Thousands of schoolchildren responded  to  the  instructions  for  using  this  program.  Basically,  they  can choose a favorite animal on the screen. As they follow instructions to imagine themselves  in  a  safe,  favorite  place,  the  animal  will  smile.  My  computer engineer colleague has now modified the program so it is available on a CDROM for home computers. I have one of these programs on a laptop and use it frequently in the clinic and hospital.'\nO n how hypnosis can help children with depression: 'Teaching children self-hypnosis  can  facilitate  a  sense  of  self-control  and  mastery  which  is important for depressed children. Often children who are depressed also have depressed  parents.  I  think  we  cannot  expect  good  results  in  working  with depressed children unless the parents are involved in the treatment.'\nO n how  doing  hypnosis  with  children  compares  technically  and relationally  to  hypnotizing  adults: 'First,  I  tell  children  and  adults  that  I serve as their coach or teacher to facilitate self-hypnosis for them. I avoid the term 'hypnotizing,' because it implies external control. In general, children remain close to their imagination and like to play. These characteristics make it  easy  for  them  to  learn  and  enjoy  self-hypnosis.  They  also  lack  abstract reasoning  skills  (most  until  at  least  age  16  years)  and  do  not  analyze themselves or the process to the extent adults do. I tell adults to 'pretend you are eight years old' when you practice self-hypnosis.'\nO n  how  her  knowledge  of  hypnosis  influences  her  personal  and professional  values  and  volunteer  efforts: 'Basic  principles  in  working with displaced persons and with developing country projects are to encourage persons in their personal coping skills, to develop ownership in programs, and to  facilitate  sustainability.  When  one  thinks  about  these  concepts,  they  are",

        "text": "The descriptions of potential difficulties that may arise in the use of hypnosis indirectly comment on the need for formal education in the dynamics of human behavior, patterns of mind-body interactions, the intricacies of treating various clinical conditions, and the need  to  be  deeply  self-aware  of  one's  own  issues,  needs,  and  motivations,  as  well  as knowing one's own limits in providing therapeutic interventions to others.\nThere  are  many  ways  to  get  into  trouble  in  clinical  practice,  virtually  all  of  them avoidable  by  being  well-educated  enough  and  emotionally  intelligent  enough.  Every professional association in the United States, and as far as I know, internationally as well, has  a  code  of  ethics.  The  code  of  ethics  spells  out  what  constitutes  appropriate  and inappropriate conduct in exhaustive detail, and each person is tasked with knowing and honoring the code.\nI  assume  that  you  are  a  helping  professional  and  that  you  have  only  the  best  of intentions  for  your  clients.  I  also  assume,  therefore,  that  the  understandings  of  human nature  and  the  capacity  for  interpersonal  influence  you  learn  here  will  be  used  in benevolent and even noble ways. Therefore, there is only a superficial coverage of the most basic ethical guidelines provided here.\n1. The number one priority is to help, not hurt. If you feel that, for any reason, you are unable to work well with either the person or problem presented to you, then evaluate honestly  whether  it  would  be  best  to  refer  that  person  elsewhere,  and  do  so  when appropriate. There are few factors, if any, more important than the therapeutic alliance in determining  treatment  outcomes  (Cummings  &  Cummings,  2000;  Duncan,  Miller,  & Coleman, 2001).\n2. A professional's responsibility is to educate, not show off. Hypnosis lends itself to both. It is my sincere hope that the hypnotic phenomena you are learning to induce are used and/or demonstrated only in appropriate clinical or educational settings. Furthermore, I would hope you are able to distinguish between your personal interests and what you teach your clients. For example, there is no legitimate basis for anyone to bring into clinical practice their interest in conducting past-life regressions or other such esoteric  procedures.  The  goal  of  any  treatment  is  to  empower  people,  not  disempower them by encouraging magical thinking.\n3. Have your relationship with your client(s) as clearly defined as possible, including the nature of the intervention, the duration, the cost, the expectations, evaluation points, and so on. Involving and educating your client will almost certainly make for a better, more productive relationship, and will also meet the legal requirement for an informed consent to treatment (Frauman et al., 1993; Scheflin, 2001).\n4.  Do  not  go  beyond  your  range  of  expertise,  or  misrepresent  yourself.  Human problems are very complex and can't be reduced to a paragraph of dynamics. If you feel you are out of your league when presented with a problem, refer the person to someone better able to meet his or her needs. Discussing cases with colleagues, continuing to get your  information  updated,  and  having  peer  supervision  may  help  you  keep  your boundaries clear (Barber, 1995).\n5. Presenting misinformation and/or the use of indirect techniques will sometimes be judged to be the best clinical approach. Be careful-such approaches can help a client, but they can also backfire. Have alternatives prepared every step of the way by thinking your  intervention  strategy  through  and  taking  all  steps  necessary  to  prevent  untoward effects. In other words, be prepared!\n6. Always  involve,  when  appropriate,  the  proper  qualified  health professionals (Cummings & Cummings, 2000). When working on a physical symptom, for example, unless you are a physician you should have a medical referral and medical clearance to work  with  the  problem.  Practicing  medicine  (psychology,  nutrition,  etc.)  without  a license or without advanced clinical training, knowledge, and backup is illegal, unethical, and irresponsible.\nThere are many, many other considerations that go into conducting a competent, legal, and ethical clinical practice. Clinicians are generally wellintentioned people who want to do the highest quality work with their clients, but they sometimes get into trouble when they underestimate the complexity of what they're dealing with, or when they don't know the  hazards  of  a  particular  type  of  problem  or  treatment  approach,  or  when  they overestimate their skills.",

        "text": "One of the most frustrating things to people in the field of clinical hypnosis is the fact that  people  with  far  less  education  in  hypnosis  than  this  book  provides  are  engaged  in providing services to the public that they are not qualified to provide. All I can do about this issue is appeal to each person to get the education and credentials it takes to practice responsibly.  It's  a  vitally  important  next  step  in  taking  seriously  the  responsibilities associated with providing health care to people.\nA  second  source  of  frustration  to  those  in  the  field  of  clinical  hypnosis  lies  in  the observation that many people take courses in hypnosis and then, when the course is over, the skills they started to acquire are not immediately utilized and soon fade into the past. The more hypnosis seems removed from mainstream practice, the easier it is to abandon. I hope through your learning process that you have seen elements of hypnotic experience all around you, and see their immediate relevance to every clinical interaction. My goal was not and is not to transform readers of this text into 'official hypnotists.' Rather, my goal has been to provide you with an introduction to a dynamic and evolving field that emphasizes  concepts  and  techniques  which  can  significantly  expand  the  range  of  both your  communication  and  clinical  skills.  Even  if  you  never  formally  induce  hypnosis again in your life, my guess is that you'll reflexively think twice before saying something like, 'Don't think about what's bothering you.'\nFrom this  introduction  to  the  field,  I  hope  that  you  are  sufficiently  intrigued  by  the range  of  possibilities  hypnosis  has  to  offer  to  want  to  continue  developing  your  skills with it. There are many ways to take that next step.\nAs you've seen from the extensive list of references throughout this book, there are more books and articles published on the subject of clinical hypnosis than any of us can read in a lifetime, and every day the list of publications grows. Staying current with the literature is a valuable way of staying connected to the evolution of the field. The sources listed in this book can provide you with a starting point for meaningful reading and, of course, the bibliography in each reference can provide further sources for learning.",

I  still  emphasize  clinical  artistry  in hypnosis, obviously, but I also emphasize the value of clinical research in informing and shaping  artistry.  There  is  so  much  more  to  say  now  about  clinical  hypnosis  than  ever before. This made it all the more difficult for me to decide what to include. I frequently found myself wanting to say more about each of the topics presented, but felt obligated to preserve this text's integrity as an introductory one.\nThere is much more to learn about the human mind, personality, communication, and the potentials of clinical hypnosis  to enhance  the  human  condition.  Our  current understandings in these domains are ever-expanding, and there appears to be no upper limit as to how much more can eventually be known. I look forward to all that is possible with curiosity and hope.",
