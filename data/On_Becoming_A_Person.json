        "text": "T hough  it shocks  m e  so m ew h a t to  say  so,  I  have been  a  psycho­ therapist  (or  personal  counselor)  for  more  than  thirty-three  years. This means that during a  period  of  a  third  of  a  century  I  have  been trying to  be  of  help  to  a  broad  sampling  of  our  population:  to  chil­ dren,  adolescents  and  adults;  to  those  with  educational,  vocational, personal  and  marital  problems;  to  ' normal,'  ' neurotic,'  and  'psy­ chotic'  individuals (the  quotes  indicate  that  for  me  these  are  all misleading  labels); to individuals  who  come for  help, and  those who  are  sent  for  help;  to  those  whose  problems  are  minor,  and  to those  whose  lives  have  become  utterly  desperate  and  without  hope. I  regard  it  as  a  deep  privilege  to  have  had  the  opportunity  to  know such a diverse multitude of people so personally and intimately.\nOut  of  the  clinical  experience  and  research  of  these  years  1   have written  several  books  and  many  articles.  The  papers  in  this  volume are selected from  those I have written during the most recent ten  of  the  thirty-three  years,  from 1951 to 1961.  I would  like  to explain the reasons that I  have for gathering them into a book.\nIn  the  first  place  I  believe  that  almost  all  of  them  have  relevance for  personal  living  in  this  perplexing  modern  world.  This  is  in  no sense  a  book  of  advice,  nor  does  it  in  any  way  resemble  the  ' doit-yourself'  treatise,  but  it  has  been  my  experience  that  readers  of these papers have often found them challenging  and enriching. They  have  to  some  small  degree  given  the  person  more  security in making  and  following  his  personal  choices  as  he  endeavors  to move  toward  being  the  person  he  would  like  to  be. So  for  this reason  I should  like  to  have them  more  widely  available  to  any",

        "text": "who  might  be  interested-to  ' the  intelligent  layman,'  as  the  phrase goes.  I  feel  this  especially  since  all  of  my  previous  books  have  been published for the professional psychological audience, and have never  been  readily  available  to  the  person  outside  of  that  group. It is my  sinccrc  hope  that  many  people  who  have  no  particular interest  in  the  field  of  counseling  or  psychotherapy  will  find  that the  learnings  emerging  in  this  field  will  strengthen  them  in  their own  living.  It  is  also  my  hope  and  belief  that  many  people  who have  never  sought  counseling  help  will  find,  as  they  read  the  ex­ cerpts  from  the  recorded  therapy  interviews  of  the  many  clients in  these  pages,  that  they  are subtly  enriched  in  courage  and  self confidence,  and that understanding  of  their  own difficulties will become  easier  as  they  live  through,  in  their  imagination  and  feel­ ing, the struggles of others toward growth.\nAnother  influence  which  has  caused  me  to  prepare  this  hook  is the  increasing  number  and  urgency  of  requests  from  those  who  are already  acquainted  with  my  point  of  view  in  counseling,  psycho­ therapy,  and  interpersonal  relationships.  They  have  made  it  known that  they  wish  to  he  able  to  obtain  accounts  of  my  more  recent thinking  and  work  in  a  convenient  and  available  package.  They  are frustrated by  hearing  of  unpublished  articles  which  they  cannot acquire; by  stumbling across papers of mine in out-of-the-way journals; they  want  them brought  together. This  is a flattering request for any author.  It also constitutes an  obligation which  I  have tried  to  fulfill. I  hope  that  they  will  be  pleased  with  the  selection  I have  made. Thus  in  this  respect  this  volume  is  for  those  psycholo­ gists,  psychiatrists,  teachers,  educators,  school  counselors, religious workers,  social  workers,  speech  therapists,  industrial  leaders,  labormanagement  specialists,  political  scientists  and  others  who  have  in the  past  found  my  work  relevant  to  their  professional  efforts.  In a very real sense, it is dedicated to them.\nThere  is  another  motive  which  has  impelled  me,  a  more  complex and  personal  one.  This  is  the search for  a suitable  audience for what I  have to  say. For more than a  decade  this  problem  has  puzzled me.  I  know  that  I  speak  to  only  a  fraction  of  psychologists.  The majority-their  interests  suggested  by  such terms  as  stimulus-response,  learning  theory,  operant  conditioning-are  so  committed  to\nseeing  the  individual  solely  as  an  object,  that  what  I  have  to  say often  baffles  if  it  does  not  annoy  them. I  also  know  that  I  speak  to but a fraction of psychiatrists.  For many,  perhaps most  of  them,  the truth  about  psychotherapy  has  already  been  voiced  long  ago  by Freud,  and  they  are  uninterested  in  new  possibilities,  and  uninter­ ested  in  or  antagonistic  to  research  in  this  field. I  also  know  that  I speak  to  but  a  portion  of  the  divergent  group  which  call  themselves counselors. The  bulk  of  this  group  are  primarily  interested  in  pre­ dictive  tests  and  measurements,  and  in  methods  of  guidance.\nSo  when  it  comes  to  the  publication  of  a  particular  paper,  I  have felt  dissatisfied  with  presenting  it  to  a  professional  journal  in  any one  of  these  fields. I have  published  articles  in  journals  of  each  of these  types,  but  the  majority  of  my  writings  in  recent  years  have piled up as  unpublished  manuscripts,  distributed  privately in mimeo­ graphed  form. They symbolize  my  uncertainty  as to  how  to  reach whatever audience it is I am addressing.\nDuring  this period journal editors, often of small or highly specialized  journals,  have  learned  of  some  of  these  papers,  and  have requested  permission  to  publish. I  have  always  acceded  to  these  re­ quests,  with  the  proviso  that  I  might  wish  to  publish  the  paper  else­ where  at  some  later  time. Thus  the  majority  of  the  papers  I  have written  during  this  decade  have  been  unpublished,  or  have  seen  the light  of  day  in  some  small,  or  specialized,  or  off-beat  journal.\nNow however I  have  concluded  that I  wish  to put  these  thoughts out  in  book  form  so  that  they  can  seek  their  own  audience. I am sure  that  that  audience  will  cut  across  a  variety  of  disciplines,  some of  them  as  far  removed  from  my  own  field  as  philosophy  and  the science of government.  Yet I  have come to believe  that the  audience will  have  a  certain  unity,  too. I believe  these  papers  belong  in  a trend  which  is  having  and will have  its impact  on  psychology, psychiatry,  philosophy,  and  other  fields. I hesitate  to  label  such  a trend  but  in my  mind  there  are  associated  with  it  adjectives  such  as phenomenological, existential, person-centered; concepts such as self-actualization,  becoming,  growth;  individuals  (in  this  country) such  as Gordon  Allport,  Abraham  Maslow,  Rollo  May. Hence, though  the  group  to  which  this  book  speaks  meaningfully  will,  I believe,  come  from  many  disciplines,  and  have  many  wide-ranging\ninterests,  a  common  thread  may  well  be  their  concern  about  the person  and  his  becoming,  in  a  modern  world  which  appears  intent upon ignoring or diminishing him.\nThere is one final  reason for putting out this book, a  motive which means  a  great  deal  to  me. It  has  to  do  with  the  great,  in  fact  the desperate,  need  of  our  times  for  more  basic  knowledge  and  more competent  skills  in  dealing  with  the  tensions  in  human  relationships. Man's  awesome  scientific  advances  into  the  infinitude  of  space  as well  as  the  infinitude  of  sub-atomic  particles  seems  most  likely  to lead  to  the  total  destruction  of  our world  unless  we  can  make  great advances  in  understanding  and  dealing  with  interpersonal  and  intergroup  tensions. I feel  very  humble  about  the  modest  knowledge which has been gained in this field.  I  hope  for the  day when  we  will invest at least  the  price  of  one  or  two  large  rockets  in  the  search  for more  adequate  understanding  of  human  relationships. But  I also feel  keenly  concerned  that  the  knowledge  we  have  gained  is  very little  recognized  and  little  utilized. I  hope  it  may  be  clear  from  this volume  that  we  already  possess  learnings  which,  put  to  use,  would help  to  decrease  the  inter-racial,  industrial,  and  international  tensions which  exist. I hope  it  will be evident  that  these learnings, used preventively,  could  aid  in  the  development  of mature,  nondefensive, understanding  persons  who  would  deal  constructively  with  future tensions  as  they  arise. If  I  can  thus  make  clear  to  a  significant  num­ ber  of  people  the  unused  resource  knowledge  already  available  in the  realm of interpersonal  relationships,  I  will  feel  greatly  rewarded.\nSo  much  for  my  reasons  for  putting  forth  this  book. Let  me conclude  with  a  few  comments  as  to  its  nature. The  papers  which are  brought  together  here  represent  the  major  areas  of  my  interest during  the  past  decade.* They  were  prepared  for  different  pur­ poses,  usually  for  different  audiences,  or  formulated  simply  for  my own  satisfaction. I have  written  for  each  chapter  an  introductory\n·   T h e  one  partial  exception  is  in  the  area  o f  explicit  theory  o f  personality. Having  just  recently  published  a  complete  and  technical  presentation  of  my theories  in  a  book  which  should  be available in any  professional  library, I have  not  tried  to  include  such  material  here. The  reference  referred  to  is  my chapter  entitled,  'A   theory  of  therapy,  personality,  and  interpersonal  relation­ ships as developed in the client-centcred framework' in Koch, S. (ed.) Psychology:  A  Study  of  a  Science,  vol.  Ill,  pp.  184-256. McGraw-Hill,  1959.\nnote  which  tries  to  set  the  material  in  an  understandable  context. I have organized the papers in such  a  way that they portray  a unified and  developing  theme  from  the  highly  personal  to  the  larger  social significance. In editing  them, I have eliminated duplication, but where  different  papers  present  the  same  concept  in  different  ways I  have  often  retained  these  ' variations  on a  theme'  hoping  that  they might  serve  the  same  purpose  as  in  music,  namely  to  enrich  the meaning  of  the  melody. Because  of  their  origin  as  separate  papers, each  one  can  be  read  independently  of  the  others  if  the  reader  so desires.\nStated  in  the  simplest  way,  the  purpose  of  this  book  is  to  share with  you  something  of  my  experience-something  of  me.  Here  is what I  have experienced  in  the  jungles  of  modern  life,  in  the  largely unmapped  territory  of  personal  relationships.  Here  is  what  I  have seen. Here  is  what  I  have  come  to  believe. Here  are  the  ways  I have  tried  to  check  and  test  my  beliefs. Here  are  some  of  the  per­ plexities,  questions,  concerns  and  uncertainties  which  I  face. I  hope that  out  of  this  sharing  you  may  find  something  which  speaks  to you.\nDepartments  of  Psychology  and  Psychiatry The  University  of  Wisconsin April,  1961\nP A R T I\nSpeaking  Personally\n/ speak  as  a  person,  from   a  context of  personal  experience  and  personal  learnings.\n' This  is  M e' The  Development of My Professional Thinking  and  Personal  Philosophy\nX\nT his  chapter  combines  two  very  personal talks. Five  years  ago  I u'as  asked  to  speak  to  the  senior  class  at  Brandeis  University  to present,  not  my  ideas  of  psychotherapy,  but  myself. How  had  I come to think the thoughts 1 had?  H ow bad I come  to be the person 1  am? I  found  this  a  very  thought-provoking  invitation,  and  I  en­ deavored to meet the request of these students.  During this past year the Student Union Forum Committee at Wisconsin made a somewhat similar  request. They  asked me  to  speak  in  a  personal vein  on  their 'Last  Lecture'  series,  in  which  it  is  assumed  that,  for  reasons  un­ specified,  the professor is giving  his last  lecture and therefore  giving quite  personally  of  himself. (It  is  an intriguing  comment  on  our educational  system  that  it  is  assumed  that  only  under  the  most  dire circumstances would a professor reveal himself in any  personal way.) In this  Wisconsin talk I expressed more f7dly  than in  the first  one  the personal  learnings  or  philosophical themes which  have  come  to  have meaning for me.  hi the  current  chapter /  have  woven  together both of  these  talks,  trying  to  retain  something  of  the  informal  character which  they  had  in  their  initial  presentation.\nThe response to  each  of these talks  has made  me  realize how  hun­\n4\ngry  people are  to  know something of the  person ·who  is speaking  to them  or teaching them.  Consequently  I  have  set this  chapter first  in the  book  in  the  hope  that  it  ·will  convey  something  of  me,  and  thus give more context and meaning to  the chapters which follovj.\nx\nI have  been   in fo r m e d   that  what  I  am  expected  to  do  in  speaking to  this  group  is  to  assume  that  m y  topic  is  ' This  is  Me.' I  feel various  reactions  to  such  an  invitation,  but  one  that  I  would  like  to mention  is that I feel  honored  and  flattered  that any  group  wants,  in a  personal  sense,  to  know  who  I  am. I  can  assure  you  it  is  a  unique and  challenging  sort  of  invitation,  and  I  shall  try  to  give  to  this honest question as  honest an answer  as I  can.\nSo,  who  am  I? I  am  a  psychologist  whose  primary  interest,  for many  years,  has  been  in  psychotherapy. What  does  that  mean? I don't  intend  to  bore  you  with  a  long  account  of  my  work,  but  I would  like  to  take  a  few  paragraphs  from  the  preface  to  my  book, Client-Centered  Therapy,  to  indicate  in  a  subjective  way  what  it means  to  me. I  was  trying  to  give  the  reader  some  feeling  for  the subject matter of the  volume,  and  I  wrote  as  follows. ' What is  this book about? Let me try  to give  an  answer which  may,  to  some  de­ gree,  convey  the  living  experience  that  this  book  is  intended  to  be. ' This  book  is  about  the  suffering  and  the  hope,  the  anxiety  and the satisfaction, with which each therapist's counseling room is filled. It  is  about  the  uniqueness  of  the  relationship  each  therapist  forms with each  client,  and  equally  about  the  common  elements which  we discover  in  all  these  relationships. This  book  is  about  the  highly personal  experiences  of  each  one  of  us. It  is  about  a  client  in  my office  who sits there by the corner  of the  desk, struggling to be  him­ self,  yet  deathly  afraid  of  being  himself -  striving  to  see  his  experi­ ence  as  it  is,  wanting  to  be  that  experience,  and  yet  deeply  fearful of the prospect.  This book is about me,  as I sit there with that clicnt, facing  him,  participating in  that  struggle  as  deeply  and  sensitively  as I  am  able. It  is  about  me  as I  try  to  perceive  his  expcricncc,  and  the\nmeaning  and  the  feeling  and  the  taste  and  the  flavor  that  it  has  for him.  It is about me  as I  bemoan my  very human  fallibility  in  under­ standing  that  client,  and  the  occasional  failures  to  see  life  as  it  ap­ pears  to  him,  failures  which  fall  like  heavy  objects  across  the  intri­ cate,  delicate  web of growth which  is  taking place. It  is  about  me  as I  rejoice  at  the  privilege  of  being  a  midwife  to  a  new  personality as  I  stand  by  with awe at  the emergence  of a  self,  a  person,  as  I  see  a birth  process in which I  have  had  an  important  and  facilitating  part. It  is  about  both  the  client  and  me  as  we  regard  with  wonder  the potent  and  orderly  forces  which  are  evident  in  this  whole  experi­ ence,  forces  which  seem  deeply  rooted  in  the  universe  as  a  whole. The  book  is,  I  believe,  about  life,  as  life  vividly  reveals  itself  in  the therapeutic process - with its blind power and its tremendous capacity  for  destruction,  but  with  its  overbalancing  thrust  toward growth,  if the opportunity for growth  is  provided.'\nPerhaps that will give you some picture  of what  I  do  and  the  way I  feel  about  it. 1  presume  you  may  also  wonder  how  I  came  to  en­ gage  in  that  occupation,  and  some  of  the  decisions and  choices,  con­ scious  and  unconscious,  which  were  made  along  the  way. Let  me see  if  I can  give  you  some  of  the  psychological  highlights  of  my autobiography,  particularly  as  it  seems  to  relate  to  my  professional life.",

I came along as the fourth of six children.  M y parents cared a great deal  for us,  and  had  our  welfare  almost  constantly  in  mind. They were  also, in  many  subtle  and  affectionate  ways,  very  controlling  of  our  be­ havior. It  was  assumed  by  them  and  accepted  by  me  that  we  were different  from  other  people - no  alcoholic  beverages,  no  dancing, cards  or  theater,  very  little  social  life,  and  much  work. I have  a hard  time  convincing  my  children  that  even  carbonated  beverages had  a  faintly  sinful  aroma,  and  I  remember  my  slight  feeling  of wickedness  when  I  had  my  first  bottle  of  'pop.' We  had  good times  together  within  the  family,  but  we  did  not  mix. So  I  was  a\npretty solitary  boy, who  read  incessantly, and  went all  through  high school  with  only  two  dates.\nWhen  I  was  twelve  my  parents  bought  a  farm  and  we  made  our home there.  The  reasons  were  twofold. My  father,  having  become a  prosperous  business  man,  wanted  it  for  a  hobby. More important, I  believe,  was  the  fact  that  it  seemed  to  m y  parents  that  a  growing adolescent  family  should  be  removed from  the  'temptations'  of suburban  life.\nHere  I  developed  two  interests  which  have  probably  had  some real  bearing  on  my  later  work. I became  fascinated  by  the  great night-flying moths (Gene  Stratton-Porter's books were  then in vogue)  and  I  became  an  authority  on  the  gorgeous  Luna,  Polyphe­ mus, Cecropia  and other  moths which inhabited our woods. I laboriously  bred  the  moths  in  captivity,  reared  the  caterpillars,  kept the  cocoons  over  the  long  winter  months,  and  in  general  realized some  of  the  joys  and  frustrations  of  the  scientist  as  he  tries  to  ob­ serve  nature.\nMy father was determined  to operate  his  new  farm  on  a  scientific basis,  so  he  bought  many  books  on  scientific  agriculture. He  en­ couraged his boys to have  independent and profitable ventures of our own,  so  my  brothers  and  I  had  a  flock  of  chickens,  and  at  one  time or other  reared  from  infancy  lambs,  pigs  and  calves. In  doing  this  I became  a  student  of  scientific  agriculture,  and have  only  realized in  recent  years  what  a  fundamental  feeling  for  science  I  gained  in that  way. There  was  no  one  to  tell  me  that  Morison's  Feeds  and Feeding  was  not  a  book for  a fourteen-year-old, so I ploughed through  its  hundreds  of  pages,  learning  how  experiments  were  con­ ducted- how  control  groups  were matched with experimental groups,  how  conditions  were  held constant  by  randomizing proced­ ures,  so  that  the  influence  of  a  given  food  on  meat  production  or milk  production  could  be  established. I learned  how  difficult  it  is to  test  an  hypothesis. I  acquired  a  knowledge  of  and  a  respect  for the  methods of science in a  field  of  practical  endeavor.",

        "text": "I  started  in  college  at  Wisconsin  in  the  field  of  agriculture. One of  the  things  I  remember  best  was  the  vehement  statement  of  an\nagronomy professor  in  regard  to  the  learning  and  use  of  facts. He stressed  the  futility  o f an  encyclopedic  knowledge  for  its  own  sake, and wound up  with the injunction,  'Don't be  a  damned ammunition wagon; be a rifle!'\nDuring  my  first  two  collcge  years  my  professional  goal  changcd, as  the  result  of  some  emotionally  charged  student  religious  confer­ ences, from that  of a scientific agriculturist to  that  of the  ministry a  slight  shift! I  changed  from  agriculture  to  history,  believing  this would  be  a  better  preparation.\nIn  my  junior  year  I  was  selected  as  one  of  a  dozen  students  from this  country  to  go  to  China  for  an  international  W orld Student Christian Federation Conference.  This was a most important experi­ ence for me.  It was  1922,  four years after the  close of W orld W ar  I. I  saw  how  bitterly  the  French  and  Germans  still  hated  each  other, even  though  as  individuals  they  seemed  very  likable. I  was  forced to  stretch  my  thinking,  to realize  that  sincere  and  honest  people could  believe  in  very  divergent  religious  doctrines. In  major  ways I  for  the  first  time  emancipated  m yself  from  the  religious  thinking of  my  parents,  and  realized  that  I  could  not  go  along  with  them. This  independence  of  thought  caused  great  pain  and  stress  in  our relationship,  but looking back  on  it  I  believe  that here, more  than  at any  other  one  time,  I  became  an  independent  person. Of  course there  was  much  revolt  and  rebellion  in my  attitude during  that period,  but  the  essential  split  was  achieved  during  the  six  months  I was on  this  trip  to the  Orient,  and  hence was  thought through away from  the  influence  of  home.\nAlthough  this  is  an  account  of  elements  which  influenced  my professional  development  rather  than  my  personal  growth,  I  wish to  mention very briefly one profoundly important factor in my per­ sonal  life. It  was  at  about  the  time  of  my  trip  to  China  that  I  fell in  love  with  a  lovely  girl  whom  I  had  known  for  many  years,  even in  childhood,  and  we  were  married,  with  the  very  reluctant  consent of our parents, as soon as  I finished college, in order that we  could  go to  graduate  school  together. I  cannot  be  very  objective  about  this, but  her  steady  and  sustaining  love  and  companionship  during  all the  years  since  has  been  a  most  important  and  enriching  factor  in my  life.\nI  chose  to  go  to  Union  Theological  Seminary,  the  most  liberal  in the  country  at  that  time (1924),  to  prepare  for  religious  work. I have  never  regretted  the  two  years  there. I came  in  contact  with some great scholars  and  teachers,  notably  Dr.  A.  C.  McGifTert,  who believed  devoutly  in  freedom  of  inquiry,  and  in  following  the  truth no matter where  it led.\nKnowing universities  and  graduate  schools  as  I  do  now - know­ ing  their  rules  and  their  rigidities - I  am  truly  astonished  at  one very  significant  experience  at  Union. A  group  of  us  felt  that  ideas were  being  fed  to  us,  whereas  we  wished  primarily  to  explore  our own  questions  and  doubts,  and  find  out  where  they  led. We  peti­ tioned  the administration  that  we  be allowed  to  set  up  a  seminar  for credit, a  seminar  with  no  instructor,  where  the  curriculum  would be composed  of our  own  questions. The  seminary  was  understandably perplexed  by  this,  but  they  granted  our  petition! The  only  restric­ tion was that in the interests of the institution a young instructor was to sit in on  the seminar, but would  take no part in it unless we wished him  to  be  active.\nI suppose  it  is  unnecessary  to  add  that  this  seminar  was  deeply satisfying and clarifying. I  feel  that  it  moved  me a  long  way  toward a  philosophy of life  which  was my  own.  The  majority  of the  mem­ bers  of that group, in thinking  their way  through the  questions  they had  raised,  thought  themselves  right  out  of  religious  work. I was one.  I felt that questions as  to  the  meaning of life,  and  the  possibility of the  constructive improvement of life  for individuals,  would  prob­ ably  always  interest  me,  but  1   could  not  work  in  a  field  where  I would  be  required  to  believe  in  some  specified  religious  doctrine. My  beliefs  had  already  changed  tremendously,  and  might  continue to  change. It  seemed  to  me  it  would  be  a  horrible  thing  to  have  to profess  a  set  of  beliefs,  in order  to  remain  in  one's  profession. I wanted  to  find  a  field  in  which  1 could  be  sure  my  freedom  of thought  would  not  be  limited.",

        "text": "But  what  field? I had  been  attracted,  at  Union,  by  the  courses and  lectures  on  psychological  and  psychiatric  work,  which  were then beginning  to develop. Goodwin  Watson,  Harrison  Elliott,\nMarian  Kenworthy  all  contributed  to  this  interest. I began  to  take more  courses  at  Teachers'  College,  Columbia  University,  across  the street  from  Union  Seminary. I took  work  in  philosophy  of  educa­ tion  with  William  H.  Kilpatrick,  and  found  him  a  great  teacher.  I began  practical clinical  work  with  children under  Leta  Hollingworth,  a  sensitive  and  practical  person. I found  myself  drawn  to child guidance work,  so  that gradually,  with  very  little  painful  read­ justment,  I  shifted  over  into  the  field  of  child  guidance,  and  began to  think  of  myself  as  a  clinical  psychologist. It  was  a  step  I  eased into,  with  relatively  little  clearcut  conscious  choice,  rather  just  fol­ lowing  the  activities  which  interested  me.\nWhile  I  was  at  Teachers'  College  I  applied  for,  and  was  granted a  fellowship  or  internship  at  the  then  new  Institute  for  Child  Guid­ ance,  sponsored  by  the  Commonwealth  Fund. I have  often  been grateful  that I  was  there  during  the  first year. The  organization was in  a  chaotic  beginning  state,  but  this  meant  that  one  could  do  what he  wanted  to  do. I  soaked  up  the  dynamic  Freudian  views  of  the staff,  which  included  David  Levy  and  Lawson  Lowrey,  and  found them  in  great conflict  with  the  rigorous,  scientific,  coldly  objective, statistical  point  of  view  then  prevalent  at  Teachers'  College. Look­ ing back,  I  believe the  necessity  of  resolving that  conflict  in  me  was a  most  valuable  learning  experience. At  the  time  I  felt  I  was  func­ tioning  in  two  completely  different  worlds,  'and  never  the  twain shall  meet.'\nBy  the  end  of  this  internship  it  was  highly  important  to  me  that I  obtain  a  job  to  support  m y  growing  family,  even  though  my  doc­ torate  was  not  completed. Positions  were  not  plentiful,  and  I re­ member  the  relief  and  exhilaration  I  felt  when  I  found  one. I was employed  as  psychologist  in  the  Child  Study  Department  of  the Society  for  the  Prevention  of  Cruelty  to  Children,  in  Rochester, New York.  There were  three psychologists  in  this  department,  and my  salary  was  $2,900  per  year.\nI  look back at the  acceptance  of that position with  amusement and some  amazement. The  reason  I was  so  pleased  was  that  it  was  a chance  to  do  the  work  1   wanted  to  do. That,  by  any  reasonable criterion  it  was  a  dead-end  street  professionally,  that  I  would  be isolated from  professional  contacts,  that  the  salary  was  not  good\neven  by  the  standards  of  that  day,  seems  not  to  have  occurred  to me, as nearly as I  can  recall. I  think  I  have always  had  a  feeling  that if I  was given some  opportunity to do the thing I was most  interested in  doing,  everything  else  would  somehow  take  care  of  itself.",

        "text": "The  next  twelve  years  in  Rochester  were  exceedingly  valuable ones. For  at  least  the  first  eight  of  these  years,  I was  completely immersed  in  carrying  on  practical  psychological  service,  diagnosing and  planning  for  the  delinquent  and  underprivileged  children  who were  sent  to  us  by  the  courts  and  agencies,  and  in  many  instances carrying on  ' treatment  interviews.' It  was  a  period  of  relative  pro­ fessional isolation,  where  my only concern  was  in  trying  to  be  more effective  with  our  clients. We  had  to  live  with  our  failures  as  well as  our  successes,  so  that  we  were  forced  to  learn. There  was  only one criterion  in  regard to any method  of dealing with  these  children and  their  parents,  and  that  was,  ' Does  it  work? Is  it  effective?' I found  I  began  increasingly  to  formulate  my  own  views  out  of  my everyday working experience.\nThree  significant  illustrations  come  to  mind,  all  small, but  im­ portant  to  me  at  the  time. It  strikes  me  that  they  are  all  instances of  disillusionment - with  an  authority,  with  materials,  with  myself. In my training I  had  been  fascinated by Dr. William  Healy's writ­ ings, indicating that delinquency was often based upon sexual conflict, and  that  if  this  conflict  was  uncovered,  the  delinquency  ceased. In my  first  or  second  year  at  Rochester  I  worked  very  hard  with  a youthful pyromaniac who  had an unaccountable  impulse  to  set  fires. Interviewing  him  day  after  day  in  the  detention  home,  I  gradually traced  back  his  desire  to  a  sexual  impulse  regarding  masturbation. Eureka! The case was solved.  However, when  placed on probation, he  again  got  into  the  same  difficulty.\nI  remember  the  jolt  I  felt. Healy might be  wrong.  Perhaps  I  was learning something Healy didn't know. Somehow  this  incident impressed me with the possibility that there  were mistakes in authori­ tative  teachings,  and  that  there  was  still  new  knowledge  to  discover.\nThe  second  naive  discovery  was  of  a  different  sort. Soon  after coming  to  Rochester  I  led  a  discussion  group  on  interviewing. I\ndiscovered  a  published  account  of  an  interview  with  a  parent,  ap­ proximately  verbatim,  in  which  the  case  worker  was  shrewd,  in­ sightful,  clevcr,  and  led  the  interview  quite  quickly  to  the  heart  of the  difficulty. I  was  happy  to  use  it  as  an  illustration  of  good  inter­ viewing  technique.\nSeveral  years  later,  I  had  a  similar  assignment  and remembered this excellent material.  I  hunted  it up  again and  re-read it. I  was ap­ palled. Now it seemed  to  me  to  be  a  clever  legalistic  type  of  ques­ tioning  by  the  interviewer  which  convicted  this  parent  of  her  un­ conscious  motives,  and  wrung  from  her  an  admission  of  her  guilt. I  now  knew  from  my  experience  that  such  an  interview  would  not be of any lasting help  to  the parent  or  the  child. It  made  me  realize that  I  was  moving  away  from  any  approach  which  was  coercive or  pushing  in  clinical  relationships, not  for  philosophical reasons, but because such  approaches  were  never  more  than  superficially  ef­ fective.\nThe  third  incident  occurred  several  years  later. I  had  learned  to be  more  subtle  and  patient  in  interpreting  a  client's  behavior  to him,  attempting to  time  it  in  a  gentle  fashion  which  would  gain  ac­ ceptance. I had  been  working  with  a  highly intelligent mother whose  boy  was  something  of  a  hellion. The  problem  was  clearly her  early  rejection  of  the  boy,  but  over  many  interviews  I  could not  help  her  to  this  insight. I drew  her  out,  I  gently  pulled  to­ gether the evidence she had  given, trying to  help  her see  the  pattern. But  we  got  nowhere. Finally  I  gave  up. I  told  her  that  it  seemed we  had both  tried, but we  had  failed,  and  that we might  as well give up our contacts.  She  agreed.  So  we  concluded  the  interview,  shook hands,  and  she  walked  to  the  door  of  the  office. Then  she  turned and  asked,  'Do  you  ever  take  adults  for  counseling  here?' When I replied  in  the  affirmative,  she  said,  ' W ell  then,  I  would  like  some help.'  She  came to  the  chair she  had  left,  and  began  to  pour  out her despair  about  her  marriage,  her  troubled  relationship  with  her  hus­ band,  her  sense of  failure  and  confusion,  all  very  different  from  the sterile ' case history'  she  had  given  before. Real  therapy  began then,  and  ultimately  it was  very  successful.\nThis incident was one of a  number which helped me to experience the  fact - only  fully  realized  later - that  it is the  client  who  knows\nwhat  hurts,  what  directions  to  go,  what  problems  are  crucial,  what experiences  have  been  deeply  buried. It  began  to  occur  to  me  that unless  I  had  a  need  to  demonstrate  my  own  cleverness  and  learning, I  would  do  better  to  rely upon  the  clicnt  for  the  direction  of  move­ ment  in  the  process.",

The University of Rochester made it clear that the work I was doing was  not psychology, and  they  had  no  interest  in my  teaching  in  the Psychology  Department.  I  went  to  meetings  of  the  American  Psy­ chological  Association and found  them  full  of papers on the  learning processes  of  rats  and  laboratory  experiments  which  seemed  to  me to have  no  relation  to  what  I  was  doing. The  psychiatric  social workers,  however,  seemed  to  be  talking  my  language,  so  I  becamc active  in  the  social  work  profession,  moving  up  to  local  and  even national  offices. Only  when  the  American  Association  for  Applied Psychology was formed did I  become really active as a  psychologist. I  began  to  teach  courses  at  the  University  on  how  to  understand and deal with problem children, under the Department of Sociology. Soon  the  Department  of  Education  wanted  to  classify  these  as  edu­ cation  courses,  also. [Before  I  left  Rochester,  the  Department  of Psychology,  too,  finally  requested  permission  to  list  them,  thus  at last  accepting  me  as  a  psychologist.] Simply  describing  these  ex­ periences  makes  me  realize how  stubbornly  I have  followed  my own  course, being relatively unconcerned  with the question of whether I was going with my group or not.\nTime does not permit to tell  of the  work  of establishing a  separate Guidance  Center  in  Rochester,  nor  the  battle  with  some  of  the psychiatric  profession  which  was  included. These  were  largely  ad­ ministrative  struggles  which  did  not  have  too  much  to  do  with  the development of my  ideas.",

I  am  sure the only  reason  I was  considered  was  my  book  on  the  Clinical Treatment  of  the  Problem  Child,  which  I  had  squeezed  out  of  va­ cations,  and  brief  leaves  of  absence. To  my  surprise,  and  contrary to  my  expectation,  they  offered  me  a  full  professorship. I heartily recommend starting in the academic world at this level.  I  have often been  grateful  that  I  have  never  had  to  live  through  the  frequently degrading  competitive  process  of  step-by-step  promotion  in  univer­ sity  faculties,  where  individuals  so  frequently  learn  only  one  lesson - not to stick their necks  out.\nIt  was  in  trying  to  teach  what  I  had  learned  about  treatment  and counseling  to  graduate  students  at  Ohio  State  University  that  I  first began  to  realize  that  I  had  perhaps  developed  a  distinctive  point  of view of my own, out of my  experience.  When  I  tried  to  crystallize some of these  ideas,  and  present  them  in  a paper  at the  University of Minnesota in December  1940,1  found the reactions were very strong. It was my first experience of the  fact that  a  new  idea of mine,  which to  me  can  seem  all  shiny  and  glowing  with  potentiality,  can  to  an­ other  person  be  a  great  threat. And  to  find  myself  the  center  of criticism,  of  arguments  pro  and  con,  was  disconcerting  and  made me  doubt and  question. Nevertheless  I  felt  I  had  something  to  con­ tribute,  and  wrote the manuscript of Counseling and Psychotherapy, setting  forth what I  felt  to be a somewhat  more effective orientation to  therapy.\nHere again I  realize  with  some  amusement  how  little  I  have  cared about being 'realistic.' When I  submitted  the  manuscript,  the  pub­ lisher thought it was interesting and new,  but wondered  what  classes would  use  it. I replied  that  I  knew  of  only  two - a  course  I  was teaching  and  one  in  another  university. The  publisher  felt  I  had made a  grave  mistake  in  not  writing  a  text  which  would  fit  courses already  being  given. He  was  very  dubious  that  he  could  sell  2,000 copies,  which  would  be  necessary  to  break  even. It  was  only  when I  said  I  would  take  it  to  another  publisher  that  he  decided  to  make the  gamble. I don't  know  which  of  us  has  been  more  surprised  at its  sales -  70,000  copies  to  date  and  still  continuing.",

I  will  very  briefly  stress two  or  three  points  which  have  some  significance  for  me.\nI have  learned  to  live  in  increasingly  deep  therapeutic  relation­ ships  with  an  ever-widening  range  of  clients. This  can  be  and  has been  extremely  rewarding. It can  be  and  has  been  at  times  very frightening,  when a  deeply  disturbed  person  seems  to  demand  that  I must  be  more  than  I  am,  in  order  to  meet  his  need. Certainly  the carrying on of therapy  is something which demands continuing per­ sonal growth on  the part of the therapist,  and  this is sometimes  pain­ ful,  even  though  in  the  long  run  rewarding.\nI would  also  mention  the  steadily  increasing  importance  which research  has  come  to  have  for  me. Therapy  is  the  experience  in which  I  can  let  myself  go  subjectively. Research  is  the  experience in which  I  can stand  off  and  try  to  view  this  rich  subjective  experi­ ence with objectivity,  applying all  the  elegant methods of science  to determine  whether  I  have  been  deceiving  myself. The  conviction grows  in  me  that  we  shall  discover  laws  of  personality and  behavior which  are  as  significant  for  human  progress  or  human  understand­ ing as  the  law  of  gravity  or  the  laws  of  thermodynamics.\nIn the last two decades I  have become  somewhat more accustomed to  being fought  over,  but  the  reactions  to  my  ideas  continue  to  sur­\nprise  me.  From  my point  of  view  I  have  felt  that  I  have  always  put forth  my  thoughts in  a  tentative  manner,  to  be  accepted  or  rejected by  the  reader  or  the  student. But  at  different times  and places psychologists,  counselors,  and  educators  have  been  moved  to  great wrath,  scorn  and  criticism  by  my  views. As  this  furore  has  tended to  die down in these fields it has in recent years been renewed among psychiatrists,  some  of  whom  sense,  in  my  way  of  working,  a  deep threat to  many  of  their most  cherished  and  unquestioned  principles. And  perhaps  the  storms  of  criticism  are  more  than  matched  by  the damage  done by  uncritical  and  unquestioning  ' disciples' - individ­ uals who  have acquired something of a  new point of view for them­ selves and have  gone  forth  to  do  battle  with  all  and  sundry,  using  as weapons  both  inaccurate  and  accurate  understandings  of  me  and my  work. I have  found  it  difficult  to  know,  at  times,  whether  I have been  hurt more by my ' friends'  or my enemies.\nPerhaps partly because of the troubling business of being struggled over,  I  have  come  to  value  highly  the  privilege  of  getting  away,  of being  alone. It  has  seemed  to  me  that  my  most  fruitful  periods  of work  are  the  times  when  I  have  been  able  to  get  completely  away from  what  others  think,  from  professional  expectations  and  daily demands,  and  gain  perspective  on  what  I  am  doing. My  wife  and I have  found  isolated  hideaways  in  Mexico  and  in  the  Caribbean where no one knows I am a psychologist; where painting, swimming, snorkeling, and  capturing some of  the  scenery in color  photography are my major activities.  Yet in these  spots, where  no  more than two to  four  hours  a  day  goes  for  professional  work,  I  have  made  most of  whatever  advances  I  have  made  in  the  last  few  years. I  prize  the privilege  of  being  alone.\n5",

        "text": "There,  in  very  brief  outline,  are  some  of the  externals  of my  pro­ fessional  life. But  I  would  like  to  take  you  inside,  to  tell  you  some\nof  the  things  I  have learned  from  the  thousands  of  hours  I have spent  working  intimately  with  individuals  in  personal  distress.\nI  would  like  to  make  it  very  plain  that  these  are  learnings  which have  significance  for  me. I do  not  know  whether  they  would  hold true  for  you. I  have no  desire  to  present  them  as  a  guide  for  anyone else. Yet  I  have  found  that  when  another  person  has  been  willing to  tell  me  something  of  his  inner  directions  this  has  been  of  value  to me,  if  only  in  sharpening  my  realization  that  m y  directions  are  dif­ ferent. So  it  is  in  that  spirit  that  I  offer  the  learnings  which  follow. In  each  case  I  believe  they  became  a  part  of  my  actions  and  inner convictions  long  before  I  realized  them  consciously. They  are  cer­ tainly  scattered  learnings,  and  incomplete. I  can  only  say  that  they are  and  have  been  very  important  to  me. I continually  learn  and relearn  them. I  frequently  fail  to  act  in  terms  of  them,  but  later  I wish  that  I  had. Frequently  I  fail  to  see  a  new  situation  as  one  in which  some  of  these  learnings  might  apply.\nThey  are  not  fixed. They  keep  changing. Some  seem  to  be  ac­ quiring  a  stronger  emphasis,  others  are  perhaps  less  important  to me  than  at  one  time,  but  they  are  all,  to  me,  significant.\nI will  introduce  each  learning  with  a  phrase  or  sentence  which gives  something  of  its  personal  meaning. Then  I  will  elaborate  on it a  bit. There  is not much organization  to  what  follows  except  that the  first  learnings  have  to  do  mostly  with  relationships  to  others. There  follow  some  that  fall  in  the  realm  of  personal  values  and convictions.\nI might  start  off  these  several  statements  of  significant  learnings with  a  negative item. In my  relationships 'with  persons I  have  found that it does not  help,  in  the  long  run,  to  act  as  though  /  were  some­ thing  that  1  am  not. It  does  not  help  to  act  calm  and  pleasant  when actually  I  am  angry  and  critical. It  docs  not  help  to  act  as  though I  know the answers when I  do not.  It does  not help  to act as though I were  a  loving  person  if  actually,  at  the  moment, I am  hostile. It  does  not  help  for  me  to  act as  though  I  were  full  of  assurance,  if actually  I  am  frightened  and  unsure. Even  on  a  very  simple  level  I have  found  that  this  statement  seems  to  hold. It  does  not  help  for me to  act  as though  I  were  well  when I  feel  ill.\nWhat  I  am  saying  here,  put  in  another  way,  is  that  I  have  not found  it  to  be  helpful  or  effective  in  my  relationships  with  other people  to  try  to  maintain  a  fagade;  to  act  in  one  way  on  the  surface when  I  am  experiencing  something  quite  different  underneath. It does not, I believe, make me helpful  in my  attempts  to  build  up  con­ structive  relationships  with  other individuals. I  would  want  to  make it clear  that  while  I  feel  I  have  learned  this  to  be  true,  I  have  by  no means adequately profited  from  it. In  fact,  it  seems  to  me  that  most of  the  mistakes  I  make  in  personal  relationships,  most  of  the  times in  which  I  fail  to  be  of  help  to  other  individuals,  can  be  accounted for  in terms  of  the  fact  that  I have,  for  some  defensive  reason, behaved  in  one  way  at  a  surface  level,  while  in  reality  my  feelings run  in  a  contrary  direction.\nA  second  learning  might  be  stated  as  follows - 7  find  I  am  more effective when I can listen acceptantly  to myself, and can  be myself. I feel  that  over  the  years  I  have  learned  to  become  more  adequate in  listening  to  myself;  so  that  I  know,  somewhat  more  adequately than  I  used  to,  what  I  am  feeling at  any  given  moment - to  be  able to  realize  I  am  angry,  or  that  I  do  feel  rejecting  toward  this  person; or  that  I  feel  very  full  of  warmth  and  affection  for  this  individual; or  that  I  am  bored  and  uninterested  in  what  is  going  on;  or  that  I am eager to understand this individual  or that  I  am anxious and  fear­ ful  in  my  relationship  to  this  person. All  of  these  diverse  attitudes are feelings which  I  think I can  listen  to in  myself. One  way of put­ ting this  is  that  I  feel  I  have  become  more  adequate  in  letting  myself be  what  I  am. It  becomes  easier  for  me  to  accept  myself  as  a  de­ cidedly  imperfect person,  who by  no  means  functions  at  all  times in the  w'ay  in  which  I  would  like  to  function.\nThis must seem  to  some  like  a  very  strange  direction  in  which  to move. It  seems  to  me  to  have  value  because  the  curious  paradox  is that  when  I  accept  myself  as  I  am,  then  I  change. I  believe  that  I have  learned  this  from  my  clients  as  well  as  within  my  own  experi­ ence - that  we  cannot  change,  we  cannot  move  away  from  what we  are,  until  we  thoroughly  accept  what  we  are. Then  change seems  to  come  about almost unnoticed.\nAnother  result  which  seems  to  grow  out  of  being  myself  is  that\nrelationships  then  become  real. Real  relationships  have  an  exciting way  of  being  vital  and  meaningful. If  I  can  accept  the  fact  that  I am annoyed at or bored by  this client or  this  student,  then  I  am also much more likely to  be able  to accept his feelings  in response. I  can also  accept  the  changed  experience  and  the  changed  feelings  which are then  likely  to  occur in me and in  him.  Real  relationships  tend  to change  rather  than  to  remain  static.\nSo  I  find  it  effective  to  let  m yself  be  what  I  am  in  my  attitudes; to know when I have reached my limit of endurance or of tolerance, and  to  accept  that  as  a  fact;  to  know  when  I  desire to mold  or manipulate  people,  and  to  accept  that  as  a  fact  in  myself. I  would like  to  be  as  acceptant  of  these  feelings  as  of  feelings  of  warmth, interest,  permissiveness,  kindness,  understanding,  which  are  also  a very  real  part  of  me. It  is  when  I  do  accept  all  these  attitudes  as  a fact,  as  a  part  of  me,  that  my  relationship  with  the  other  person then  becomes  what  it  is,  and is able to grow  and  change  most readily.\nI  come  now  to  a  central  learning  which  has  had  a  great  deal  of significance for me.  I can state this learning as  follows:  / have found it  of  enormous  value  when  I  can  permit  myself  to  understand  an­ other  person. The way in  which  I  have  worded  this  statement  may seem  strange  to  you. Is  it  necessary  to permit  oneself  to  understand another? I  think  that  it  is. Our  first  reaction  to  most  of  the  state­ ments  which  we  hear  from  other  people  is  an  immediate  evaluation, or  judgment,  rather  than  an  understanding  of  it. When  someone expresses  some  feeling  or  attitude  or  belief,  our  tendency  is,  almost immediately,  to  feel  'That's  right' ;  or  'T h at's  stupid' ;  ' T hat's  ab­ normal' ; ' T h at's unreasonable' ; ' That's incorrect' ; ' T h at's not nice.' Very  rarely  do  we  permit  ourselves  to  understand  precisely what the meaning of his statement is to him.  I  believe  this  is  because understanding  is  risky. If I let  myself  really  understand  another person,  I  might  be  changed  by  that  understanding. And we  all  fear change.  So as I  say, it is not an easy thing to permit oneself to under­ stand  an  individual,  to  enter  thoroughly  and  completely  and  empathically  into  his  frame  of  reference. It  is  also  a  rare  thing.\nTo  understand  is  enriching  in  a  double  way. I find  when  I  am\nworking with clients in  distress, that to understand the bizarre world of  a  psychotic  individual,  or  to  understand  and  sense  the  attitudes of a  person who  feels that life  is  too  tragic  to  bear,  or  to  understand a  man  who  feels  that  he  is  a  worthless  and  inferior  individual each  of  these  understandings  somehow  enriches  me. I learn  from these  experiences  in  ways  that  change  me,  that  make  me  a  different and,  I  think,  a  more  responsive  person. Even  more  important  per­ haps,  is  the  fact  that  m y  understanding  of  these  individuals  permits them  to  change. It permits  them  to  accept  their  own fears and bizarre  thoughts  and  tragic  feelings  and  discouragements,  as  well  as their moments of courage and kindness and love and sensitivity.  And it is  their experience  as well  as mine that when  someone  fully  under­ stands  those  feelings,  this  enables  them  to  accept  those  feelings  in themselves.  Then  they  find  both  the  feelings  and  themselves  chang­ ing. Whether  it  is  understanding  a  woman  who  feels  that  very  lit­ erally she  has a hook  in  her  head by  which others  lead  her  about,  or understanding a man  who  feels  that  no  one  is  as  lonely,  no  one  is  as separated from others as he,  I find these understandings to be of value to  me. But  also,  and  even  more  importantly,  to  be  understood  has a very positive  value to  these  individuals.\nHere  is  another  learning  which  has  had  importance  for  me. I have  found it  enriching  to  open  channels  whereby  others  can  communicate  their  feelings,  their  private  perceptual  worlds,  to  me. Be­ cause  understanding  is  rewarding,  1   would  like  to  reduce  the  bar­ riers  between  others  and  me,  so  that  they  can,  if  they  wish,  reveal themselves  more  fully.\nIn  the  therapeutic  relationship  there  are  a  number  of  ways  by which  I  can  make  it  easier  for  the  client  to  communicate  himself. I  can  by  m y  own  attitudes  create  a  safety  in  the  relationship  which makes such  communication  more possible.  A  sensitiveness  of under­ standing which  sees  him  as  he  is  to  himself,  and  accepts  him  as  hav­ ing  those  perceptions  and  feelings,  helps  too.\nBut  as  a  teacher  also  I  have  found  that  I  am  enriched  when  I  can open  channels  through  which  others  can  share  themselves  with  me. So  I  try,  often  not  too  successfully,  to  create  a  climate  in  the  class­ room  where  feelings  can  be  expressed,  where  people  can  differ -\nith  each  other  and  with  the  instructor. I have  also frequently asked  for  'reaction  sheets'  from  students - in  which  they  can  ex­ press  themselves  individually  and  personally  regarding  the  course. They  can  tell  of  the  way  it  is  or  is  not  meeting  their  needs,  they can  express  their  feelings  regarding the  instructor,  or  can  tell  of  the personal  difficulties  they  are  having  in  relation  to  the  course. These reaction  sheets  have  no  relation  whatsoever  to  their  grade. Some­ times  the  same  sessions  of  a  course  are  experienced  in  diametrically opposite  ways. One  student  says,  'M y  feeling  is  one  of  indefinable revulsion  with  the  tone  of  this  class.' Another,  a  foreign  student, speaking of  the  same  week  of  the  same  course  says,  ' Our  class  fol­ lows  the  best,  fruitful  and scientific  way  of  learning. But  for people who  have  been  taught  for a  long,  long  time,  as  we  have,  by  the  lec­ ture  type,  authoritative  method,  this  new  procedure  is  ununderstandable. People  like  us  are  conditioned  to  hear  the  instructor,  to keep  passively  our  notes  and  memorize  his  reading  assignments  for the exams.  There is no  need  to say that it takes  long time  for people to  get  rid  of  their  habits  regardless  of  whether  or  not  their  habits are  sterile,  infertile  and  barren.' To  open  myself  to  these  sharply different  feelings  has  been  a  deeply  rewarding  thing.\nI have  found  the  same  thing  true  in  groups  where  I  am  the  ad­ ministrator, or perceived as the  leader.  I  wish to  reduce  the  need for fear  or  defensiveness,  so  that  people  can  communicate  their  feelings freely. This  has  been  most  exciting,  and  has  led  me  to  a  whole  new view  of  what  administration  can  be. But  I  cannot  expand  on  that here.\nThere  is  another  very  important  learning  which  has  come  to  me in my counseling work.  I can  voice this  learning very  briefly.  I have fowid  it  highly  rewarding when  I  can  accept  another  person.\nI have  found  that  truly  to  accept  another  person  and  his  feelings is  by  no  means  an  easy  thing,  any  more  than  is  understanding. Can 1 really  permit  another  person  to  feel  hostile  toward  me? Can  I acccpt  his  anger  as  a  real  and  legitimate  part  of himself? Can  I accept  him  when  he  views  life  and  its  problems  in  a  way  quite  dif­ ferent  from  mine? Can  I  accept  him  when  he  feels  very  positively\ntoward  me,  admiring  me  and  wanting  to  model  himself  after  me? All  this  is  involved  in  acceptance,  and  it  docs  not  come  easy. I  be­ lieve  that  it  is  an  increasingly  common  pattern  in  our  culture  for each  one  of  us  to  believe,  ' Every  other  person  must  feel  and  think and  believe  the  same  as  I  do.\" We  find  it  very  hard  to  permit  our children  or our  parents or our spouses to  feel  differently  than  we  do about  particular  issues  or  problems. We  cannot  permit  our  clients or our students to  differ  from us or to utilize  their experience in their own individual ways.  On a  national scale,  we  cannot  permit another nation  to  think  or  feel  differently  than  we  do. Vet  it  has  come  to seem  to  me  that  this  separateness  of  individuals,  the  right  of  each individual  to  utilize  his  experience  in  his  own  way  and  to  discover his  own  meanings  in  it, - this  is  one  of  the  most  priceless  poten­ tialities  of  life. Each  person  is an  island  unto  himself,  in  a  very  real sense;  and  he  can  only  build  bridges  to  other  islands  if  he  is  first of  all  willing  to  be  himself  and  permitted  to  be  himself. So  I find that  when  I  can  accept  another  person,  which  means  specifically accepting  the  feelings  and  attitudes  and  beliefs  that  he  has  as  a  real and  vital  part  of  him,  then  I  am  assisting  him  to  become  a  person: and there seems to me great value in this.\nThe next learning I  want to  state may be difficult  to communicate. It  is this. The more I am open to  the realities in vie  and in  the  other person,  the  less  do  I  find  myself  'wishing  to  rush  in  to  'fix  things As I  try  to  listen  to  myself and  the  experiencing  going on  in  me,  and the  more  I try to extend  that  same  listening  attitude  to another person,  the  more  respect  I  feel  for  the  complex  processes  of  life. So  I  become  less  and  less  inclined  to  hurry  in  to  fix  things,  to  set goals,  to  mold  people,  to  manipulate  and  push  them  in  the  way  that I  would like  them to go. I  am  much  more  content simply  to  be my­ self and  to  let another  person  be  himself. I  know  very  well  that  this must seem  like  a  strange,  almost  an  Oriental  point of  view. What  is life  for  if  we  are  not  going to  do  things  to  people? What is  life  for if we  are  not  going  to  mold  them  to  our  purposes? What is life  for if  we  are  not  going  to  teach  them  the  things  that  ire  think  they 6hould  learn? What  is  life  for  if  we  arc  not  going  to  make  them\nthink  and  feel  as  we  do? How  can  anyone  hold  such  an  inactive point  of  view  as  the  one  I  am  expressing? I  am  sure  that  attitudes such as these  must be a part of the  reaction  of many  of you.\nYet  the  paradoxical  aspect  of  my  experience  is  that  the  more  I am simply willing to be  myself,  in all  this complexity of life  and  the more  I  am  willing  to  understand  and  accept  the  realities  in  myself and  in  the  other  person,  the  more  change  seems  to  be  stirred  up. It is  a  very  paradoxical  tiling -  that  to  the  degree  that  each  one  of  us is  willing  to  be  himself,  then  he  finds  not  only  himself changing;  but he  finds  that  other  people  to  whom  he  relates  are  also  changing. At least this is a very vivid part of my  experience, and one of the  deepest tilings  I  think  I  have  learned  in  my  personal  and  professional  life.\nLet me turn now to some other learnings which are  less concerned with  relationships,  and  have  more  to  do  with  my  own  actions  and values. The  first  of  these  is  very  brief. I  can  trust  my  experience.\nOne of  the  basic  things  which  I  was  a  long  time  in  realizing,  and which  I  am  still  learning,  is  that  when  an  activity  feels  as  though it  is  valuable  or  worth  doing,  it  is  worth  doing. Put  another  way, I have  learned  that  my  total  organismic  sensing  of  a  situation  is more trustworthy than my intellect.\nAll  of  my  professional  life  I  have  been  going  in  directions  which others  thought  wr ere  foolish,  and about  which  I have  had  many doubts  myself. But  I have never  regretted  moving  in  directions which  ' felt  right,'  even  though  I  have  often  felt  lonely  or  foolish at the time.\nI  have  found  that  when  I  have  trusted  some  inner  non-intellectual sensing,  I  have  discovered wisdom  in  the  move. In  fact  I  have  found that  when  I  have  followed  one  of  these  unconventional  paths  be­ cause  it  felt right  or  true,  then  in  five  or ten  years  many  of  my  col­ leagues  have  joined  me,  and  I  no  longer  need  to  feel  alone  in  it.\nAs  I  gradually  come  to  trust  my  total  reactions  more  deeply,  I find  that  I  can  use  them  to  guide  m y  thinking. I have come  to  have more  respect  for  those  vague  thoughts  which  occur  in  me  from time  to  time,  which  feel  as  though  they  were  significant. I am  in­ clined  to  think  that  these  unclear  thoughts  or  hunches  will  lead  me to important areas.  I  think of it as trusting  the  totality of my  experi­\nence,  which  I  have  learned  to  suspect  is  wiser  than  my  intellect. It is  fallible  I  am  sure,  but  I  believe  it  to  be  less  fallible  than  m y  con­ scious mind alone. My attitude is very well expressed by Max Weber, the  artist,  when  he  says.  ' In  carrying  on  my  own  humble  creative effort,  I  depend  greatly  upon  that  which  I  do  not  yet  know,  and upon that which I have not yet done.'\nVery  closely  related  to  this  learning  is  a  corollary  that,  evaluation by  others is not a guide for me.  The judgments of others,  while  they are  to  be  listened  to,  and  taken  into  account  for  what  they  are,  can never  be  a  guide  for  me. This  has  been  a  hard  thing  to  learn. I  re­ member  how  shaken  I  was,  in  the  early  days,  when  a  scholarly thoughtful  man  who  seemed  to  me  a  much  more  competent  and knowledgeable  psychologist  than  I,  told  me  what  a  mistake  I  was making by getting interested  in  psychotherapy. It  could  never  lead anywhere,  and  as  a  psychologist  I  would  not  even  have  the  oppor­ tunity to practice it.\nIn  later years it has sometimes jolted me  a bit to learn  that  I  am,  in the  eyes  o f some  others,  a  fraud,  a  person  practicing  medicine  with­ out  a  license,  the  author  of  a  very  superficial  and  damaging  sort  of therapy,  a  power  seeker,  a  mystic,  etc. And  I  have  been  equally disturbed  by  equally  extreme  praise. But  I  have  not  been  too  much concerned  because  I  have  come  to  feel  that  only  one  person  (at least  in  my  lifetime,  and  perhaps  ever)  can  know  whether  what  I am  doing  is  honest,  thorough,  open,  and  sound,  or  false  and  de­ fensive  and  unsound,  and  I  am  that  person. I am  happy  to  get  all sorts  of  evidence  regarding  what  I  am  doing  and  criticism (both friendly  and  hostile)  and  praise (both  sincere  and  fawning) are  a part of  such  evidence. But  to  weigh  this  evidence  and  to  determine its  meaning  and  usefulness  is  a  task  I  cannot  relinquish  to  anyone else.\nIn  view  of  what  I  have  been  saying  the  next  learning  will  prob­ ably  not  surprise  you. Experience  is,  for  me,  the  highest  authority. The touchstone of validity is my own experience.  N o  other person's ideas,  and  none  of  my  own  ideas,  are  as  authoritative  as  my  experi­ ence. It  is  to  experience  that  I  must  return  again  and  again,  to  dis­\ncover  a  closer  approximation to truth  as it is in the process  of becoming in me.\nNeither  the  Bible  nor  the  prophets - neither  Freud  nor  research - neither  the  revelations  of  God  nor  man - can  take  precedence over my own direct experience.\nMy  experience  is  the  more  authoritative  as  it  becomes  more  pri­ mary, to use the semanticist's term.  Thus the hierarchy of experience would be most authoritative at  its  lowest  level.  If  I  read  a  theory of psychotherapy,  and  if  I  formulate  a  theory  of  psychotherapy  based on  my  work  with  clients,  and  if  I  also  have  a  direct  experience  of psychotherapy  with  a  client,  then  the  degree  of  authority  increases in the order in which I have listed these experiences.\nMy experience  is not authoritative  because  it  is infallible. It  is  the basis  of  authority  because  it  can  always  be  checked  in  new  primary ways. In  this  way  its  frequent  error  or  fallibility  is  always  open  to correction.\nNow another personal  learning. /  enjoy  the  discovering  of  order in  experience. It  seems  inevitable  that  I  seek  for  the  meaning  or  the orderliness  or  lawfulness  in  any  large  body  of  experience. It  is  this kind of curiosity, which I find it very satisfying to  pursue, which has led  me  to  each  of  the  major  formulations  I  have  made. It  led  me  to search  for  the  orderliness  in  all the  conglomeration  of  things  cli­ nicians did for children, and  out of that came my book on  The Clini­ cal  Treatment  of  the  Problem  Child. It  led  me  to formulate  the general  principles  which  seemed  to  be  operative  in  psychotherapy, and  that  has  led  to  several  books  and  many  articles. It  has  led  me into  research  to  test  the  various  types  of  lawfulness  which  I  feel  I have  encountered  in  my  experience. It  has  enticed  me  to  construct theories  to  bring  together  the  orderliness  of  that  which  has  already been  experienced  and  to  project  this  order  forward  into  new  and unexplored realms where it may be further tested.\nThus  I  have  come  to  see  both  scientific  research  and  the  process of theory construction as being aimed toward the inward ordering of significant  experience. Research  is  the  persistent  disciplined  effort to  make sense  and  order  out  of  the  phenomena  of  subjective  experi­\nence. It  is  justified  because  it  is  satisfying  to  perceive  the  world  as having  order,  and  because  rewarding  results  often  ensue  when  one understands  the  orderly  relationships  which  appear  in  nature.\nSo  I  have  come  to  recognize  that  the  reason  I  devote  myself  to research,  and  to  the  building  of  theory,  is  to  satisfy  a  need  for  per­ ceiving  order  and  meaning,  a  subjective  need  which  exists  in  me. I  have,  at  times,  carried  on  research  for  other  reasons - to  satisfy others,  to  convince  opponents  and  sceptics,  to  get  ahead  profession­ ally,  to  gain  prestige,  and  for  other  unsavory  reasons. These  errors in  judgment  and  activity  have  only  served to convince  me  more deeply  that  there  is  only  one  sound  reason  for  pursuing  scientific activities,  and  that  is  to  satisfy  a  need  for  meaning  which  is  in  me.\nAnother learning which cost me  much  to recognize,  can be stated in  four words.  The facts are friendly.\nIt  has  interested  me  a  great  deal  that  most  psychotherapists,  es­ pecially  the  psychoanalysts,  have  steadily  refused  to  make  any  sci­ entific  investigation  of  their  therapy,  or  to  permit  others  to  do  this. I can understand this reaction because I have felt it.  Especially in our early  investigations  I  can  well  remember  the  anxiety  of  waiting  to see  how  the  findings  came  out. Suppose  our  hypotheses  were  dis­ proved! Suppose  we  were  mistaken  in  our  views! Suppose  our opinions  were  not  justified! At such  times,  as  I  look  back,  it  seems to me  that  I regarded  the facts  as potential  enemies,  as  possible bearers  of  disaster. I have  perhaps  been  slow  in  coming  to  realize that  die  facts  are  always  friendly. Every  bit  of  evidence  one  can acquire,  in any area,  leads one  that much closer  to  what is  true. And being  closer  to  the  truth  can  never  be  a  harmful  or  dangerous  or unsatisfying  thing. So while I  still  hate to  readjust  my  thinking,  still hate  to  give  up  old  ways  of  perceiving  and  conceptualizing,  yet  at some  deeper  level  I  have,  to  a  considerable  degree,  come  to  realize that these  painful  reorganizations are  what  is  known  as learning, and that  though  painful  they  always  lead  to  a  more  satisfying  because somewhat  more  accurate  way  of  seeing  life. Thus  at  the  present time one  of die most enticing areas  for thought and  speculation  is  an area  where  several  of  my  pet  ideas  have  not  been  upheld  by  the",

I feel sure the facts will be my friends.\nSomewhere  here  I  want  to  bring  in  a  learning  which  has  been most  rewarding,  because  it  makes  me  feel  so  deeply  akin  to  others. I  can  word it this way. What is most personal is most general.  There have  been  times  when  in  talking  with  students  or  staff,  or  in  my writing, I  have  expressed myself in  ways  so personal  that  1   have  felt I  was expressing an attitude which it was probable  no one  else  could understand,  because  it  was  so  uniquely  my  own. Two  written  ex­ amples of this are  the  Preface to  Client-Centered Therapy  (regarded as most unsuitable  by  the  publishers),  and  an  article  on  ' Persons  or Science.' In  these  instances  I  have  almost  invariably  found  that  the very  feeling  which  has  seemed  to  me  most  private,  most  personal, and hence  most incomprehensible  by others,  has  turned out  to  be  an expression  for  which  there  is  a  resonance  in  many  other  people. It has  led  me  to  believe  that  what  is most  personal  and  unique  in  each one  of  us  is  probably  the  very  element  which  would,  if  it  were shared  or  expressed,  speak  most  deeply  to  others. This  has  helped me  to  understand  artists  and  poets  as  people  who  have  dared  to  ex­ press the unique in themselves.\nThere  is  one  deep  learning  which  is  perhaps  basic  to  all  of  the things  I  have  said  thus  far. It  has  been  forced  upon  me  by  more than  twenty-five  years  of  trying  to  be  helpful  to  individuals  in  per­ sonal  distress. It  is  simply  this. It  has  been  my  experience  that  per­ sons have a basically  positive  direction. In  my  deepest contacts  with individuals  in  therapy,  even  those  whose  troubles  arc  most  disturb­ ing,  whose  behavior  has  been  most  anti-social,  whose  feelings  seem most abnormal,  I  find this to be  true.  W hen I  can  sensitively  under­ stand  the  feelings  which  they  are  expressing,  when  I  am  able  to accept  them  as  separate  persons  in  their  own  right,  then  I  find  that they  tend  to  move  in  certain  directions. And what  are  these  direc­ tions  in  which  they  tend  to  move? The  words  which  I  believe  are most  truly descriptive are words  such  as positive, constructive, moving  toward  self-actualization,  growing  toward  maturity,  grow­\ning  toward  socialization. I have  come  to  feel  that  the  more  fully the  individual  is  understood  and accepted,  the  more  he  tends  to drop  the  false  fronts  with  which  he  has  been  meeting  life,  and  the more he tends to move in a direction which is forward.\nI  would  not  want  to  be  misunderstood  on  this. I do  not  have  a Pollyanna  view  of  human  nature. I  am  quite  aware  that  out  of  de­ fensiveness  and  inner  fear  individuals  can  and  do  behave  in  ways which  are  incredibly  cruel,  horribly  destructive,  immature,  regres­ sive, anti-social,  hurtful. Yet one of the most refreshing and  invigor­ ating parts  of my experience  is to work w'ith  such  individuals  and  to discover  the  strongly  positive  directional  tendencies  which  exist  in them, as in all of us, at the deepest levels.\nLet me bring this  long list to a close with  one  final  learning which can  be  stated  very  briefly. Life,  at  its  best,  is  a  flowing,  changing process in which nothing is fixed. In  my  clients  and  in  myself  I  find that  when  life  is  richest  and  most  rewarding  it  is  a  flowing  process. To  experience  this  is  both  fascinating and  a  little  frightening. I  find I am at my best when I can  let the  flow  of my  experience  carry me, in  a  direction  wiiich  appears  to  be  forward,  toward  goals  of  which I  am  but  dimly  aware. In  thus  floating  with  the  complex  stream  of my experiencing, and in trying to understand its ever-changing com­ plexity,  it  should  be  evident  that  there  are  no  fixed  points. When  I am  thus able  to  be in  process,  it  is  clear  that  there  can  be  no  closed system of beliefs,  no unchanging set of principles which I  hold. Life is  guided  by  a  changing  understanding  of  and  interpretation  of  my experience.  It is always in process of becoming.\nI  trust  it  is  clear  now  why  there  is  no  philosophy  or  belief  or  set of principles which  I  could  encourage  or persuade  others  to  have  or hold. I can  only  try  to  live  by  my  interpretation  of  the  currcm meaning of my  experience, and try to give others the  permission  and freedom  to  develop  their  own  inward  freedom  and  thus  their  own meaningful interpretation of their own experience.\nIf  there  is  such  a  thing  as  truth,  this  free  individual  process  of search  should,  I  believe,  converge  toward  it. And  in  a  limited  way, this is also what I seem to have experienced.\nP A R T II\nHow  Can  I  Be  of Help?\n/ have  found  a  way of  'working with  individuals  which  seems  to  have much  constructive  potential.\n2",

Curiously,  they  span  a  large  segment of the country  in their points of delivery - Oberlin, Ohio; St.  Louis, Missouri;  and  Pasadena,  California. They  also  cover  a  period  in which  much  research  was  accumulating,,  so  that  statements  made tentatively  in  the first paper are rather solidly  confirmed  by  the  time of the third.\nIn the following talk given at Oberlin College in 1954 I was trying to compress  into  the  briefest  possible  time  the  fundamental  prin­ ciples  of  psychotherapy  which  had  been  expressed  at greater  length in  my  books,  (Counseling  and  Psychotherapy)  (1942)  and  (ClientCentered Therapy)  (1951).  It is of  interest  to me  that I  present  the facilitating  relationship,  and  the  outcomes,  with  no  description  of, or  even  comment  on,  the  process  by  which  change  comes  about.\nX\nT o  b e  f a c e d   b y   a  troubled,  conflicted  person  who  is  seeking  and expecting  help,  has  always  constituted  a  great  challenge  to  me. Do I  have  the  knowledge,  the  resources,  the  psychological  strength,\n31\nthe  skill - do  I  have  whatever  it  takes  to  be  of  help  to  such  an  indi­ vidual?\nFor  more  than  twenty-five  years  I  have  been  trying  to  meet  this kind of challenge. It  has  caused  me  to  draw  upon  every  element  of my  professional  background: the  rigorous  methods  of  personality measurement  which  I  first  learned  at  Teachers'  College,  Columbia; the  Freudian  psychoanalytic  insights  and  methods  of  the  Institute for  Child  Guidance  where  I  worked  as  interne;  the  continuing  de­ velopments  in  the  field  of  clinical  psychology,  with  which  I  have been  closely  associated;  the  briefer  exposure  to  the  work  of  Otto Rank, to the methods of psychiatric social work, and other  resources too  numerous to  mention. But  most  of  all  it  has  meant  a  continual learning  from  my  own  experience  and  that  of  my  colleagues  at  the Counseling  Center  as  we  have  endeavored  to  discover  for  ourselves effective means of working with  people in  distress.  Gradually I  have developed  a  way  of  working  which  grows  out  of  that  experience, and which can be tested, refined, and reshaped  by  further experience and by research.",

        "text": "One brief way  of describing  the  change  which  has  taken  place  in me  is  to  say  that  in  my  early  professional  years  I  was  asking  the question,  How  can  I  treat,  or  cure,  or  change  this  person? Now  I would phrase the question in this way:  How can I provide a relation­ ship  which  this  person  may  use  for  his  own  personal  growth?\nIt  is  as  I  have  come  to  put  the  question  in  this  second  way  that  I realize  that  whatever  I  have  learned  is applicable  to  all  of my human relationships,  not  just  to  working  with  clients  with  problems. It  is for  this  reason  that  I  feel  it  is  possible  that  the  learnings  which  have had  meaning  for  me  in  my  experience  may  have  some  meaning  for you  in  your  experience,  since  all  of  us  are  involved  in  human  rela­ tionships.\nPerhaps  I  should  start  with  a  negative  learning. It  has  gradually been  driven  home  to  me  that  I  cannot  be  of  help  to  this  troubled person  by  means  of  any  intellectual  or  training  procedure. No  ap­ proach  which  relies  upon  knowledge,  upon  training,  upon  the  ac­ ceptance of something that is taught, is of any  use.  These approaches\nseem  so  tempting  and  direct  that  I  have,  in  the  past,  tried  a  great many  of them. It  is  possible  to  explain  a  person  to  himself,  to  pre­ scribe  steps  which  should  lead  him  forward,  to  train  him  in  knowl­ edge  about  a more satisfying inode  of life. But  such  methods  are,  in mv  experience,  futile  and  inconsequential. The  most  they  can  ac­ complish  is  some  temporary  change,  which  soon  disappears,  leaving the  individual  more  than  ever  convinced  of  his  inadequacy.\nThe  failure  of any such  approach  through  the  intellect  has  forced me  to recognize  that  change  appears  to  come  about  through  experi­ ence in  a  relationship. So  I  am  going to  try  to  state  very  briefly  and informally,  some  of  the  essential hypotheses  regarding  a  helping relationship  which  have  seemed to  gain  increasing confirmation  both from experience and research.\nI  can  state  the  overall  hypothesis  in  one  sentence,  as  follows. If I can  provide  a  certain  type  of  relationship,  the  other  person  will discover  within  himself  the capacity  to use  that relationship  for grow th, and change and personal development will occur.",

        "text": "But  what  meaning  do  these  terms  have? Let  me  take  separately the three major phrases in this sentence and indicate something of the meaning they  have  for  me.  W hat is this  certain  type  of relationship I would like to provide?\nI  have  found  that  the  more  that  I  can  be  genuine  in  the  relation­ ship,  the more  helpful it will  be. This means that  I  need  to  be  aware of  my  own  feelings,  in  so  far  as  possible,  rather  than  presenting  an ounvard fa9ade  of one  attitude,  while  actually  holding  another  atti­ tude  at  a  deeper  or  unconscious  level. Being  genuine  also  involves the  willingness  to  be  and  to  express,  in  my  words  and  my  behavior, the various feelings and  attitudes which  exist  in  me. It  is  only  in  this wav  that  the  relationship  can  have  reality,  and  reality  seems  deeply important  as  a  first  condition. It  is  only  by  providing  the  genuine reality w hich is in me, that the  other  person  can successfully seek  for the reality  in him. I have  found  this  to  be  true  even  when  the attitudes  I  feel  are  not  attitudes  with  which  I  am  pleased,  or  atti­ tudes  which  seem  conducive  to  a  good  relationship. It  seems  ex­ tremely important to be real.\nAs a  second  condition,  I  find  that  the  more  acceptance  and  liking I  feel  toward  this  individual,  the  more  I  will  be  creating  a  relation­ ship which he can use.  By acceptance I  mean a warm  regard  for him as  a  person  of  unconditional  self-worth - of  value  no  matter  what his  condition,  his  behavior,  or  his  feelings. It  means  a  respect  and liking for  him  as  a  separate  person,  a  willingness  for  him  to  possess his  own  feelings  in  his  own  way. It  means  an  acceptance  of and  re­ gard  for  his  attitudes  of  the  moment,  no  matter  how  negative  or positive,  no  matter  how  much  they  may  contradict  other  attitudes he  has  held  in  the  past. This  acceptance  of  each  fluctuating  aspect of  this  other  person  makes  it  for  him  a  relationship  of  warmth  and safety,  and  the  safety  of being  liked  and  prized  as  a  person  seems  a highly important element in a helping relationship.\nI  also find  that  the  relationship  is  significant  to  the  extent  that I  feel  a  continuing  desire  to  understand - a  sensitive  empathy  with each of the client's feelings and  communications as they  seem  to  him at  that  moment. Acceptance  does  not  mean  much  until  it  involves understanding. It  is  only  as  I  zmderstmd  the  feelings  and  thoughts which seem  so  horrible  to  you,  or  so  weak,  or  so  sentimental,  or  so bizarre - it  is  only  as  I  see  them  as  you  see  them,  and  accept  them and you, that you feel really free  to explore all  the hidden nooks and frightening  crannies of  your  inner  and often buried  experience. This  freedom  is  an  important  condition  of  the  relationship. There is  implied  here  a  freedom  to  explore  oneself  at  both  conscious  and unconscious  levels,  as  rapidly  as  one  can  dare  to  embark  on  this dangerous  quest. There  is  also  a  complete  freedom  from  any  type of  moral  or  diagnostic  evaluation,  since  all  such  evaluations  are,  I believe, always threatening.\nThus the  relationship  which  I  have  found  helpful  is  characterized by a  sort  of transparency on  my part,  in  which  my  real  feelings are evident;  by  an  acceptance  of  this  other  person  as  a  separate  person with  value  in  his  own  right;  and  by  a  deep  empathic  understanding which  enables  me  to  see  his  private  world  through  his  eyes. When these  conditions  are  achieved,  I  become  a  companion  to  my  client, accompanying  him  in  the  frightening  search  for  himself,  which  he now feels free to undertake.\nI  am  by  no  means  always  able  to  achieve  this  kind  of  relationship\nwith another,  and  sometimes,  even  when  I  feel  I  have  achieved  it  in myself,  he  may  be  too  frightened  to  perccivc  what  is  being  offered to  him. But  I  would  say  that  when  I  hold  in  myself  the  kind  of  at­ titudes  I  have  described,  and  when  the  other  person  can  to  some degree experience these attitudes, then I believe that change and  con­ structive personal  development  will  invariably occur - and  I  in­ clude  the  word  ' invariably'  only  after  long  and  careful  considera­ tion.",

        "text": "So much  for  the  relationship. The  second  phrase  in  my  overall hypothesis  was  that  the  individual  will  discover  within  himself  the capacity  to  use  this  relationship  for  growth. I will  try  to  indicate something of the  meaning which  that phrase  has  for  me. Gradually my  experience  has  forced  me  to  conclude  that  the  individual  has within  himself  the  capacity  and  the  tendency,  latent  if  not  evident, to  move  forward  toward  maturity. In  a  suitable  psychological  cli­ mate this tendency is released, and  becomes actual  rather than  poten­ tial. It is evident in the capacity  of the individual  to understand those aspects  of  his  life  and  of  himself  which  are  causing  him  pain  and dissatisfaction, an understanding  which probes  beneath his con­ scious  knowledge  of  himself  into  those  experiences  which  he  has hidden  from  himself  because  of  their  threatening  nature. It  shows itself  in  the  tendency  to  reorganize  his  personality  and  his  relation­ ship  to  life  in  ways  which  are  regarded  as  more  mature. Whether one  calls  it  a  growth  tendency,  a  drive  toward  self-actualization,  or a  forward-moving  directional  tendency,  it  is  the  mainspring  of  life, and  is,  in the  last  analysis, the  tendency  upon  which  all  psycho­ therapy  depends. It  is  the  urge  whiclTls~evidcnt  in  all  organic  and human  life - to  expand,  extend,  become  autonomous,  develop,  ma­ ture -  the  tendency  to  express  and  activate  all  the  capacities  of  the organism,  to  the  extent  that  such  activation  enhances  the  organism or  the  self. This  tendency  may  become  deeply  buried  under  layer after  layer  of  encrusted  psychological  defenses;  it  may  be  hidden behind  elaborate  fagades  which  deny  its  existence;  but  it  is  my  be­ lief that it exists in every  individual,  and awaits  only  the  proper con­ ditions to be released and expressed.\nThk  O utcomes\n1 have  attempted  to  describe  the  relationship  which  is  basic  to constructive  personality  change. 1 have  tried  to  put  into  words  the type  of  capacity  which  the  individual  brings  to  such  a  relationship. The  third  phrase  of my  general  statement was  that  change  and  per­ sonal  development  would  occur. It  is  m y  hypothesis  that  in  such  a relationship  the  individual  will  reorganize  himself  at  both  the  con­ scious  and  deeper  levels  of  his  personality  in  such  a  manner  as  to cope  with  life  more constructively, more  intelligently, and in a more socialized  as  well  as  a  more  satisfying  way.\nHere  I  can  depart  from  speculation  and  bring  in  the  steadily  in­ creasing  body  of  solid  research  knowledge  which  is  accumulating. We know  now that  individuals  who  live  in  such  a  relationship  even for  a  relatively  limited  number  of  hours  show  profound  and  signifi­ cant  changes  in  personality,  attitudes,  and  behavior,  changes  that  do not  occur  in  matched  control  groups. In  such  a  relationship  the  in­ dividual  becomes  more  integrated,  more  effective. He  shows  fewer of the characteristics which are usually termed neurotic or psychotic, and  more  of  the characteristics of the healthy,  well-functioning person. He  changes  his  perception  of  himself,  becoming  more  re­ alistic  in his  views  of  self. He  becomes  more  like  the  person  he wishes  to  be. He  values  himself  more  highly. He  is  more  self-con­ fident  and  self-directing. He  has  a  better  understanding  of  himself, bccomes more  open  to  his  experience,  denies  or  represses  less  of  his experience. He  becomes  more  accepting  in  his  attitudes  toward others, seeing others as more similar to  himself.\nIn  his  behavior  he  shows  similar  changes. He  is  less  frustrated  by stress, and recovers  from stress more quickly.  He becomes more ma­ ture  in  his  everyday  behavior  as  this  is  observed  by  friends. He  is less  defensive,  more adaptive,  more  able  to meet situations creatively.\nThese are some of the changes which we now know come about in individuals  who  have  completed  a  series  of  counseling  interviews  in which  the  psychological  atmosphere  approximates  the  relationship  I described. Each of the  statements  made  is based  upon  objective  evi­ dence. Much  more  research  needs  to  be  done,  but  there  can  no longer  be  any  doubt  as  to  the  effectiveness  of  such  a  relationship  in producing personality change.",

The  ex­ citement  comes  from  the  fact  that  these findings  justify  an  even broader  hypothesis  regarding  all  human  relationships. There  seems every  reason  to  suppose  that  the  therapeutic  relationship  is  only  one instance of interpersonal relations, and that the same  lawfulness governs  all  such  relationships. Thus  it  seems  reasonable  to  hypo­ thesize  that  if  the  parent  creates  with  his  child  a  psychological  cli­ mate  such  as  we  have  described,  then  the  child  will  become  more self-directing,  socialized,  and  mature. To the  extent  that  the  teacher creates  such  a  relationship  with  his  class,  the  student  will  become  a self-initiated  learner,  more  original,  more  self-disciplined,  less  anx­ ious  and other-directed. If the administrator,  or  military or in­ dustrial  leader,  creates  such  a  climate  within  his  organization,  then his  staff  will become  more  self-responsible,  more  creative, better able  to  adapt  to  new  problems,  more  basically  cooperative. It  ap­ pears possible to  me  that we  are  seeing the  emergence  of  a  new field of  human  relationships,  in  which  we  may  specify  that  if  certain attitudinal  conditions  exist,  then  certain  definable  changes  will  oc­ cur.",

I have formulated  the  hypothesis  which  has  gradually  come  to  have  mean­ ing  for  me - not  only  in  my  relationship  to  clients  in  distress,  but in  all  m y  human  relationships. I have  indicated  that  such  research knowledge  as  we  have  supports  this  hypothesis,  but  that  there  is much more  investigation  needed. I  should  like  now  to  pull  together into  one  statement  the  conditions  of this  general  hypothesis,  and the effects which are specified.\nIf I can create a relationship characterized on my part:\nby a  genuineness and  transparency,  in which  I  am  my  real  feel­ ings;\nby  a  warm  acceptance  of  and  prizing  of  the  other  person  as  a separate individual;\nby a sensitive ability to see his world and himself as he sees them; Then the other individual in the relationship:\nwill  experience  and  understand  aspects  of  himself  which  pre­ viously he has repressed;\nwill  find  himself becoming better integrated, more  able  to func­ tion effectively;\nwill become more similar to the person he would like to be;\nwill be more self-directing and self-confident;\nwill  become  more  of  a  person,  more  unique  and  more  self-ex­ pressive;\nwill be more understanding, more acceptant of others;\nwill  be  able  to  cope  with  the  problems  of  life  more  adequately and more comfortably.\nI  believe  that  this  statement  holds  whether  I  am  speaking  of  my relationship with a client, with a  group of students or staff members, with my family or children.  It seems to me that we  have  here a gen­ eral  hypothesis  which  offers  exciting  possibilities  for  the  develop­ ment of  creative,  adaptive,  autonomous  persons.\n3\nThe Characteristics  of a  Helping  Relationship\n%\nI have  long  had  the  strong  conviction - some  might  say  it  was  an obsession - that  the  therapeutic  relationship  is  only  a  special  in­ stance  of  interpersonal  relationships  in  general,  and  that  the  same lawfulness governs all such relationships.  This was the  theme I chose to  work  out  for  myself when  I  was  asked  to  give  an  address  to  the convention of the American  Perso?mel  and Guidance  Association at St. Louis, in 1958.\nEvident in  this  paper is  the  dichotomy  between  the  objective  and the subjective which  has been  such  an  important  part  of my  experi­ ence  during  recent  years. I  find  it  very difficult  to give  a  paper which  is  either  wholly objective  or  wholly  subjective. I like to bring  the  two  worlds into  close  juxtaposition,  even  if  I  cannot  fully reconcile them.\n%\nM y  i n t e r e s t  in   p s y c h o t h e r a p y   has brought about in me  an inter­ est in every kind of  helping relationship.  By this  term  I  mean a  relationship  in  which  at  least  one  of  the  parties  has  the  intent  of\npromoting  the  growth,  development,  maturity,  improved  function­ ing, improved coping with life of the other.  The  other, in  this sense, may be one individual or a  group.  T o   put it in  another way,  a  help­ ing  relationship  might  be  defined  as  one  in  which  one  of  the  par­ ticipants intends that there should come  about, in one  or both parties,  more  appreciation  of,  more  expression  of,  more  functional use of the latent  inner  resources  of the  individual.\nNow  it  is  obvious  that  such  a  definition  covers  a  wide  range  of relationships  which  usually  are intended to facilitate growth. It would certainly  include  the  relationship  between  mother  and  child, father  and  child. It would  include  the  relationship  between  the physician  and  his  patient. The  relationship  between  teacher  and pupil would  often  come  under  this  definition,  though  some  teachers would not have  the promotion of growth  as  their  intent.  It  includes almost  all  counselor-client  relationships,  whether  we  are  speaking  of educational  counseling,  vocational  counseling,  or  personal  counsel­ ing. In  this  last-mentioned  area  it  would  include  the  wide  range  of relationships  between  the  psychotherapist  and  the  hospitalized  psy­ chotic,  the  therapist and  the  troubled  or neurotic  individual,  and  the relationship  between  the  therapist  and  the  increasing  number  of  socalled ' normal'  individuals  who  enter  therapy to improve  their own functioning or accelerate their personal growth.\nThese  are  largely  one-to-one  relationships. But  we  should  also think  of  the  large  number  of  individual-group  interactions  which are  intended  as  helping  relationships. Some  administrators  intend that their relationship  to  their  staff groups shall  be  of  the  sort  which promotes  growth,  though  other  administrators  would  not  have  this purpose. The  interaction  between  the  group  therapy  leader  and his  group  belongs  here. So  does  the  relationship  of  the  community consultant  to  a  community  group. Increasingly  the  interaction  be­ tween the  industrial  consultant and  a  management group  is intended as  a  helping  relationship. Perhaps  this  listing  will  point  up  the  fact that  a  great  many  of  the  relationships  in  which  we  and  others  are involved  fall  within  this  category  of  interactions  in  which  there  is the  purpose  of  promoting  development  and  more  mature  and  ade­ quate functioning.",

        "text": "Most of the studies throw  light  on  the  attitudes on  the  part  of  the helping  person which  make  a relationship growth-promoting  or growth-inhibiting.  Let us look at some of these.\nA careful  study  of parent-child  relationships  made some  years ago by  Baldwin  and  others  ( 1)  at  the  Fels  Institute  contains  interesting evidence. Of  the  various  clusters  of  parental  attitudes  toward  chil­ dren,  the  ' acceptant-democratic'  seemed  most  growth-facilitating. Children of  these  parents  with  their  warm  and  equalitarian  attitudes showed an accelerated intellectual  development  (an  increasing I.Q.)»\nmore  originality,  more  emotional  security  and  control,  less  excit­ ability  than  children  from other  types  of  homes. Though somewhat slow  initially  in  social  development,  they  were,  by  the  time  they reached  school  age,  popular,  friendly,  non-aggressive  leaders.\nWhere  parents'  attitudes  are  classed  as  'actively  rejectant'  the children  show  a  slightly  decelerated  intellectual  development,  rela­ tively poor use of  the  abilities  they  do possess,  and some  lack  of ori­ ginality. They  are  emotionally  unstable,  rebellious,  aggressive,  and quarrelsome.  The children of parents with other attitude syndromes tend in  various respccts  to  fall in  between these  extremes.\nI  am  sure  that  these  findings  do  not  surprise  us  as  related  to  child development. I would  like  to  suggest  that  they  probably  apply  to other  relationships  as  well,  and  that  the  counselor  or  physician  or administrator  who  is  warmly  emotional and  expressive,  respectful  of the individuality of himself and of the other, and who exhibits a nonpossessive  caring,  probably  facilitates  self-realization  much  as  does a parent with these attitudes.\nLet  me  turn  to  another  careful  study  in  a  very  different  area. Whitehorn  and  Betz ( 2, 18) investigated the degree of  success achieved  by  young  resident  physicians  in working  with  schizo­ phrenic patients on a psychiatric ward.  They  chose for special study the  seven  who  had  been  outstandingly  helpful,  and  seven  whose  pa­ tients  had  shown  the  least  degree  of  improvement. Each  group  had treated about fifty  patients.  The investigators examined  all  the avail­ able  evidence  to  discover  in  what  ways  the  A  group  (the  successful group)  differed  from  the  B  group. Several  significant  differences were  found.  The  physicians in the  A  group  tended  to  sec  the  schiz­ ophrenic  in  terms  of  the  personal  meaning  which  various  behaviors had  to  the  patient,  rather  than  seeing  him  as  a  case  history  or  a descriptive  diagnosis.  They also  tended to  work  toward  goals which were  oriented  to  the  personality  of  the  patient,  rather  than  such goals  as  reducing  the  symptoms  or  curing the  disease. It  was  found that the helpful physicians, in their day by  day interaction,  primarily made  use  of  active  personal  participation -  a  person-to-person  re­ lationship.  They made less use of procedures which could be classed as  ' passive  permissive.' They were even less  likely  to  use  such  pro­ cedures  as  interpretation,  instruction  or  advice,  or  emphasis  upon",

        "text": "the  practical  care  of  the  patient. Finally,  they  were  much  more likely than the B group to develop  a relationship  in which  the patient felt  trust  and  confidence  in  the  physician.\nAlthough  the  authors  cautiously  emphasize  that  these  findings  re­ late  only  to  the  treatment  of  schizophrenics,  I  am  inclined  to  dis­ agree.  I  suspect that similar facts would be found in a research study of almost any class of helping relationship.\nAnother interesting study focuses upon the way in which  the per­ son  being  helped  perceives  the  relationship. Heine  ( 11)  studied  in­ dividuals  who  had  gone  for  psychotherapcutic  help  to  psychoan­ alytic,  client-centered,  and  Adlerian  therapists. Regardless  of  the type  of  therapy,  these  clients  report  similar  changes  in  themselves. But  it  is  their  perception  of  the  relationship  which  is  of  particular interest  to  us  here. When  asked  what  accounted  for  the  changes which  had occurred,  they  expressed  some  differing  explanations,  de­ pending  on  the  orientation  of  the  therapist. But  their  agreement  on the major elements they had found helpful was even more significant. They  indicated  that  these  attitudinal  elements  in  the  relationship accounted  for  the changes which  had  taken  place  in  themselves:  the trust they had felt in the therapist;  being understood by the therapist; the  feeling of independence  they had  had  in  making choices and  de­ cisions. The  therapist  procedure  which  they  had  found  most  help­ ful  was  that  the  therapist  clarified  and  openly  stated  feelings  which the  client  had  been  approaching  hazily  and  hesitantly.\nThere  was  also  a  high  degree  of  agreement  among  these  clients, regardless  of  the  orientation  of  their  therapists,  as  to  what  elements had  been  unhelpful  in  the  relationship. Such  therapist  attitudes  as lack  of interest,  remoteness  or  distance,  and  an  over-degree  of  sym­ pathy,  were  perceived  as  unhelpful. As  to procedures,  they  had found  it  unhelpful  when  therapists  had  given  direct  specific  advice regarding  decisions  or  had  emphasized  past  history  rather  than  pre­ sent  problems. Guiding  suggestions  mildly  given  were  perccived in an intermediate range - neither clcarly helpful nor unhelpful.\nFiedler,  in  a  much  quoted  study  ( 7),  found  that  expert  therapists of differing orientations formed similar relationships with their clients. Less well  known  are  the  elements  which  charactcri/cd  these relationships,  differentiating  them  from  the  relationships  formed  by\nless  expert  therapists. These  elements  are:  an  ability  to  understand the  client's  meanings  and  feelings;  a  sensitivity  to  the  client's  atti­ tudes;  a  warm  interest  without  any  emotional  over-involvement.\nA  study  by  Quinn  (14)  throws  light  on  what  is  involved  in  un­ derstanding the client's meanings and feelings.  His study is surprising in  that  it  shows  that  ' understanding'  of  the  client's  meanings  is  es­ sentially  an  attitude  of  desiring  to  understand. Quinn  presented  his judges  only  with  recorded  therapist  statements  taken  from  inter­ views. The  raters  had  no  knowledge  of  what  the  therapist  was  re­ sponding  to  or  how  the  client  reacted  to  his  response. Yet  it  was found  that  the  degree  of  understanding  could  be  judged  about  as well  from  this  material  as  from  listening  to  the  response  in  context. This  seems  rather conclusive  evidence  that  it  is  an  attitude  of  want­ ing  to  understand  which  is  communicated.\nAs to the emotional quality of the  relationship, Seeman  (16)  found that success  in  psychotherapy  is  closely  associated  with  a  strong  and growing  mutual  liking  and  respect  between  client  and  therapist.\nAn  interesting  study  by  Dittes  (4)  indicates  how  delicate  this  re­ lationship is. Using  a physiological measure, the psychogalvanic reflex,  to  measure  the  anxious  or  threatened  or  alerted  reactions  of the client, Dittes  correlated the deviations  on  this  measure with judges'  ratings  of the  degree  of  warm  acceptance  and  permissiveness on  the  part  of  the  therapist. It  was  found  that  whenever  the  thera­ pist's attitudes  changed  even  slightly  in  the direction  of  a  lesser degree  of  acceptance,  the  number  of  abrupt  G SR   deviations  signif­ icantly  increased. Evidently  when  the  relationship  is  experienced  as less acceptant  the organism  organizes  against  threat, even at the physiological  level.\nWithout  trying  fully  to  integrate  the  findings  from  these  various studies,  it  can  at  least  be  noted  that  a  few   things  stand  out. One  is the  fact  that  it  is  the  attitudes  and  feelings  of  the  therapist,  rather than  his  theoretical  orientation,  which  is  important. His  procedures and techniques  are  less  important  than  his  attitudes. It  is  also  worth noting  that  it  is  the  w ay  in  which  his  attitudes  and  procedures  are perceived  which  makes  a  difference  to  the  client,  and  that  it  is  this perception  which  is  crucial.",

These  studies  have  to do  with  what  we  might  think  of  as  manufactured  relationships.\nVerplanck (17), Greenspoon  (8) and  others  have  shown  that operant  conditioning  of  verbal  behavior  is  possible  in  a  relationship. Very  briefly,  if  the  experimenter  says  'Mhm,'  or  ' Good,'  or  nods his  head  after  certain  types  of  words  or  statements,  those  classes  of words  tend  to  increase  because  of  being  reinforced. It has  been shown  that  using  such  procedures  one  can  bring  about  increases  in such  diverse  verbal  categories  as  plural  nouns,  hostile  words,  state­ ments of opinion.  The person  is completely unaware  that he is  being influenced  in  any  way  by  these  reinforcers. The  implication  is  that by  such  selective  reinforcement  we  could  bring  it  about  that  the other  person  in  the  relationship  would  be  using  whatever  kinds  of words  and  making whatever  kinds  of  statements  we  had  decided  to reinforce.\nFollowing  still  further  the  principles  of  operant  conditioning  as developed by Skinner and his group,  Lindsley  ( 12)  has  shown  that  a chronic schizophrenic  can  be placed  in a  ' helping  relationship'  with a machine.  The  machine,  somewhat  like  a  vending machine,  can  be set  to  reward  a  variety  of  types  o f  behaviors. Initially  it  simply  re­ wards- with  candy,  a  cigarette,  or  the  display  of  a  picture - the lever-pressing  behavior  of  the  patient. But  it  is  possible  to  set  it  so that  many  pulls  on  the  lever  may  supply  a  hungry  kitten -  visible in  a  separate  enclosure -  with a  drop  of milk. In  this  case  the  satis­ faction is an altruistic one.  Plans are being developed to  reward  simi­ lar social or altruistic behavior directed toward  another patient, placed  in  the  next  room. The  only  limit  to  the  kinds  of  behavior which might be  rewarded  lies  in  the  degree  of  mechanical  ingenuity of  the  experimenter.\nLindsley reports  that  in  some  patients  there  has  been  marked  clin­ ical improvement.  Personally I  cannot  help  but be  impressed  by  the description of one patient who had gone  from a deteriorated chronic\nstate  to  being  given  free  grounds  privileges,  this  change  being  quite clearly  associated  with  his  interaction  with  the  machine. Then  the experimenter  decided  to  study  experimental  extinction,  which,  put in  more  personal  terms,  means  that  no  matter  how  many  thousands of times the lever was pressed, no reward  of any  kind was forthcom­ ing. The  patient  gradually  regressed,  grew  untidy,  uncommunica­ tive,  and  his  grounds  privilege  had  to  be  revoked. This (to  me) pathetic  incident  would  seem  to  indicate  that  even  in  a  relationship to  a  machine,  trustworthiness  is  important  if  the  relationship  is  to be  helpful.\nStill  another  interesting  study  of  a  manufactured  relationship  is being  carried  on  by  Harlow  and  his  associates  ( 10),  this  time  with monkeys. Infant  monkeys,  removed  from  their  mothers  almost  im­ mediately  after  birth,  are,  in  one  phase  of  the  experiment,  presented with  two  objects. One  might  be  termed  the  ' hard  mother,'  a  slop­ ing cylinder of wire  netting with  a nipple from  which  the  baby  may feed. The  other  is  a  ' soft  mother,'  a  similar  cylinder  made  of  foam rubber  and  terry  cloth. Even when an  infant  gets  all  his  food  from the ' hard mother'  he  clearly  and  increasingly prefers the ' soft mother.' Motion  pictures  show  that  he  definitely  'relates'  to  this object,  playing with  it,  enjoying  it,  finding  security  in  clinging  to  it when strange objects are near, and using that security as a  home  base for  venturing  into  the  frightening  world. Of  the  many  interesting and  challenging  implications  of  this  study, one  seems  reasonably clear. It  is  that  no  amount  of  direct  food  reward  can  take  the  place of  certain  perceived  qualities  which  the  infant  appears  to  need  and desire.",

        "text": "Let  me  close  this  wide-ranging -  and  perhaps  perplexing - sam­ pling  of  research  studies  with  an  account  of  two  very  recent  in­ vestigations.  The first is an  experiment conducted  by  Ends and  Page (5). Working  with  hardened  chronic  hospitalized  alcoholics  who had  been  committed  to  a  state  hospital  for  sixty  days,  they  tried three different methods of group psychotherapy.  The method which they  believed  would  be  most  effective  was  therapy  based  on  a  twofactor  theory  of  learning;  a  client-centered  approach  was  expected\nto  be  second;  a  psychoanalytically  oriented  approach  was  expected to  be  least  efficient. Their  results  showed  that  the  therapy  based upon  a  learning  theory  approach  was  not  only  not  helpful,  but  was somewhat  deleterious. The  outcomes  were  worse  than  those  in  the control group which had no therapy.  The analytically oriented ther­ apy  produced  some  positive  gain,  and  the client-centered group therapy was associated  with  the  greatest  amount  of  positive  change. Follow-up  data,  extending  over  one  and  one-half  years,  confirmed the  in-hospital  findings,  with  the  lasting  improvement being  greatest in  the  client-centered  approach,  next  in  the  analytic,  next  the  con­ trol  group, and least in those handled by a  learning theory approach.\nAs I have  puzzled  over  this study,  unusual  in  that the  approach  to which  the  authors  were  committed  proved  least  effective,  I  find  a clue,  I  believe,  in  the  description  of  the  therapy  based  011  learning theory  (13). Essentially  it  consisted  (tf)  of  pointing  out  and  label­ ling  the  behaviors  which  had  proved  unsatisfying,  (b)  of  exploring objectively  with  the  client  the  reasons  behind  these  behaviors,  and ( c ) of  establishing  through  re-education  more  effective  problem­ solving  habits. But  in  all  of  this  interaction  the  aim,  as  they  formu­ lated it,  was  to  be  impersonal. The  therapist  ' permits  as  little  of  his own  personality  to  intrude  as  is  humanly  possible.' The  'therapist stresses  personal  anonymity  in  his  activities,  i.e.,  he  must  studiously avoid  impressing  the  patient  with  his  own (therapist's) individual personality  characteristics.' To  me  this  seems  the  most  likely  clue to  the  failure  of  this  approach,  as  I  try  to  interpret  the  facts  in  the light  of  the  other  research  studies. To  withhold  one's  self as a  per­ son  and  to  deal  with  the  other  person  as  an  object  docs  not  have  a high  probability  of  being  helpful.\nThe  final  study  I  wish  to  report  is  one  just  being  completed  by Halkidcs  (9). She  started  from  a  theoretical  formulation  of  mine regarding  the  necessary  and  sufficient  conditions  for  therapeutic change  (15).  She hypothesized that there  would  be  a  significant  re­ lationship  between  the  extent  of  constructive  personality  change  in the  client  and  four  counselor  variables: (a)  the  degree  of  empathic understanding  of  the  client  manifested  by  the  counselor; (b) the degree  of  positive  affective  attitude  (unconditional  positive  regard) manifested  by  the  counselor  toward  the  client; ( c ) the  extent  to\nwhich  the  counselor  is  genuine,  his  words  matching  his  own  inter­ nal  feeling;  and ( d ) the  extent  to  which  the  counselor's  response matches  the  client's  expression  in  the  intensity  of  affective  expres­ sion.\nTo investigate  these  hypotheses  she  first  selected,  by  multiple  ob­ jective criteria,  a  group  of  ten  cases  which  could  be  classed  as  'most successful'  and  a  group  of  ten  ' least  successful'  cases. She  then took  an  early  and  late  recorded  interview  from  each  of  these  cases. On a random  basis she picked  nine  client-counselor  interaction  units - a  client  statement  and  a  counselor  response - from  each  of these interviews. She  thus  had  nine  early  interactions  and  nine  later  in­ teractions from each case.  This gave her several hundred units which were  now  placed  in  random  order. The  units  from  an  early  inter­ view  of  an  unsuccessful  case  might  be  followed  by  the  units  from a  late  interview  of  a  successful  case,  etc.\nThree  judges,  who  did  not  know  the  cases  or  their  degree  of success,  or the source of any  given unit, now  listened to  this material four  different  times. They  rated  each  unit  on  a  seven  point  scale, first as to the degree  of  empathy,  second as to the counselor's positive  attitude  toward  the  client,  third  as  to  the  counselor's  con­ gruence  or  genuineness,  and  fourth  as  to  the  degree  to  which  the counselor's  response  matched  the  emotional  intensity  of  the  client's expression.\nI  think  all  o f  us  who  knew  of the  study  regarded  it  as  a very  bold venture.  Could judges listening to  single units of interaction possibly make any reliable  rating of such subtle  qualities as  I have mentioned? And  even  if  suitable  reliability  could  be  obtained,  could  eighteen counselor-client  interchanges  from  each  case -  a  minute  sampling of  the  hundreds  or  thousands  of  such  interchanges  which  occurred in each  case - possibly  bear  any relationship to the therapeutic outcome? The  chance seemed  slim.\nThe  findings  are  surprising. It  proved  possible  to  achieve  high reliability  between  the  judges,  most  of  the  inter-judge  correlations being in  the  0.80's or 0.90's, except on the  last variable. It  was  found that  a  high  degree  of  empathic  understanding  was  significantly  as­ sociated,  at  a  .001  level,  with  the  more  successful  cases. A  high  de­ gree  of  unconditional  positive  regard  was  likewise  associated  with",

Even  the  rating  of  the counselor's  genuineness  or  congruence -  the  extent  to  which his words matched his feelings - was associated  with the successful  out­ come  of  the  case,  and  again  at  the  .001 level  of  significance. Only in  the  investigation  of  the  matching  intensity  of  afTcctive  expression were the  results equivocal.\nIt  is  o f  interest  too  that  high  ratings  of  these  variables  were  not associated  more  significantly  with  units  from  later  interviews  than with  units  from  early  interviews. This  means  that  the  counselor's attitudes  were  quite  constant  throughout  the  interviews. If  he  was highly empathic, he tended to be so  from first  to  last.  If he was lack­ ing  in genuineness,  tliis  tended  to  be  true  of  both  early  and  late interviews.\nAs  with  any  study,  this  investigation has its limitations. It is concerned  with  a certain type of helping relationship, psycho­ therapy.  It investigated only  four variables thought to  be significant. Perhaps  there  are  many  others. Nevertheless  it  represents  a  signif­ icant  advance  in  the  study  of  helping  relationships. Let  me  try  to state  the  findings  in  the  simplest  possible  fashion. It  seems  to  indi­ cate  that  the  quality  of  the  counselor's  interaction  with  a  client  can be  satisfactorily  judged  on  the  basis  of  a  very  small  sampling  of  his behavior. It  also  means  that  if  the  counselor  is  congruent  or  trans­ parent,  so  that  his words  are  in  line  with  his  feelings  rather  than  the two  being  discrepant;  if  the  counselor likes the client, uncondi­ tionally;  and  if  the  counselor  understands  the  essential  feelings  of the  client  as  they  seem  to  the  client - then  there  is  a  strong  proba­ bility  that  this  will  be  an  effective  helping  relationship.",

It  is  equally  clear that the studies  thus  far  made  do  not  give  us  any  final  answers  as  to  what is  a  helping  relationship,  nor  how  it  is  to  be  formed.",

        "text": "I  believe  each  of  us  working  in  the  field  of  human  relationships has  a  similar  problem  in  knowing  how  to  use  such  research  knowl­ edge.  VVe  cannot slavishly follow such findings in a mechanical  way or  we  destroy  the  personal  qualities  which  these  very  studies  show to  be  valuable. It  seems  to  me  that  we  have  to  use  these  studies, testing  them against  our own  experience and forming  new  and further  personal  hypotheses  to  use  and  test  in  our  own  further  per­ sonal  relationships.\nSo  rather  than  try  to  tell  you  how  you  should  use  the  findings  I have  presented  I  should  like to  tell  you  the  kind  of  questions  which these  studies and  my  own  clinical  experience  raise  for  me,  and  some of  the  tentative  and  changing  hypotheses  which  guide  my  behavior as  I enter  into  what  I  hope  may  be  helping  relationships,  whether with  students,  staff,  family,  or clients. Let me list a  number of these questions and considerations.\n1. Can  I  be  in  some  way  which  will  be  perceived  by  the  other person  as  trustworthy,  as  dependable  or  consistent  in  some  deep sense? Both  research  and  experience  indicate  that  this  is  very  im­ portant,  and  over  the  years  I  have  found  what  I  believe  are  deeper and  better  ways  of  answering  this  question. I  used  to  feel  that  if  I fulfilled  all the  outer  conditions  of  trustworthiness - keeping  ap­ pointments,  respecting  the  confidential  nature  of  the  interviews,  etc. - and  if  I  acted  consistently  the  same  during  the  interviews,  then this  condition  would  be  fulfilled. But  experience  drove  home  the fact  that  to  act  consistently  acceptant,  for  example,  if  in  fact  I  was feeling  annoyed  or  skeptical  or  some  other  non-acceptant  feeling, was  certain  in  the  long  run  to  be  perceived  as  inconsistent  or  un­ trustworthy. I  have  come  to  recognize  that  being trustworthy  does not  demand  that  I  be  rigidly  consistent  but  that  I  be  dependably real. The  term  ' congruent'  is  one  I  have  used  to  describe  the  way\nI  would  like  to  be. By this  I  mean  that whatever  feeling  or  attitude I am  experiencing  would  be  matched  by  my  awareness  of  that  at­ titude. When  this  is  true,  then  1   am  a  unified  or  integrated  person in  that  moment,  and  hence  I  can  be  whatever  I  deeply  am. This  is a  reality  which  I  find  others  experience  as  dependable.\n2. A  very  closely  related question  is  this: Can  I be  expressive enough  as  a  person  that  what  I  am  will  be  communicated  unambig­ uously? I  believe  that  most  of  my  failures  to  achieve  a  helping  re­ lationship can be  traced to unsatisfactory  answers  to these two questions. When  I  am  experiencing  an  attitude  of  annoyance  to­ ward another person but am  unaware of it,  then  my  communication contains contradictory messages.  M y  words  are  giving one  message, but I am also in subtle ways communicating the annoyance  I feel  and this  confuses the  other  person  and  makes  him  distrustful,  though  he too  may  be  unaware  of  what  is  causing  the  difficulty. When  as  a parent  or  a  therapist  or  a  teacher  or  an  administrator  I  fail  to  listen to  what  is  going  on  in  me,  fail  bccause  of  my  own  defensiveness  to sense  my  own  feelings,  then  this  kind  of  failure  seems  to  result. It has made it seem  to  me  that the  most basic  learning  for  anyone who hopes  to  establish  any  kind  of  helping  relationship  is  that  it  is  safe to  be  transparently  real. If  in  a  given  relationship  I  am  reasonably congruent, if no feelings relevant to the relationship are  hidden either to me or the other person, then I can  be almost sure that the relation­ ship will be a helpful one.\nOne way of putting this  which may seem strange  to you  is  that if I  can  form  a  helping  relationship  to  m yself - if I  can  be  sensitively aware  of  and  acceptant  toward  my  own  feelings - then  the  likeli­ hood  is  great  that  I  can  form  a  helping  relationship  toward  another.\nNow, acceptantly to be what I am, in this sense, and  to  permit this to show through to the other person, is the most difficult task I  know and  one  I  never  fully  achieve. But  to  realize  that  this  is  m y  task has  been  most  rewarding  because  it  has  helped  me  to  find  what  has gone  wrong  with  interpersonal  relationships  which have  become snarled  and  to  put  them  on  a  constructive  track  again. It  has  meant that  if  I  am  to  facilitate  the  personal  growth  of  others  in  relation to  me,  then  I  must  grow,  and  while  this  is  often  painful  it  is  also enriching.\n3.  A  third  question  is: Can  I  let  myself  experience  positive  atti­ tudes  toward  this  other  person - attitudes  of  warmth,  caring,  lik­ ing,  interest,  respect? It  is  not  easy. I find  in  myself,  and  feel  that I often  see  in  others,  a  certain amount  of  fear  of  these  feelings. We are afraid that if we  let ourselves freely experience  these positive feelings  toward  another  we  may  be  trapped  by  them. They  may lead  to  demands  on  us  or  we  may  be  disappointed  in  our  trust,  and these  outcomes  we  fear. So  as  a  reaction  we  tend  to  build  up  dis­ tance between  ourselves  and  others - aloofness, a ' professional' attitude,  an  impersonal  relationship.\nI  feel  quite strongly  that one  of the  important  reasons for the  pro­ fessionalization  of  every  field  is  that  it  helps  to  keep  this  distance. In  the  clinical  areas  we  develop  elaborate  diagnostic  formulations, seeing  the  person  as  an  object. In  teaching  and  in  administration we  develop  all  kinds  of  evaluative  procedures,  so  that  again  the  per­ son  is  perceived  as  an  object. In  these  ways,  I  believe,  we  can  keep ourselves  from  experiencing the  caring  which would  exist if we  rec­ ognized  the  relationship  as  one  between  two  persons. It  is a real achievement  when  we  can  learn,  even  in  certain  relationships  or  at certain  times  in  those  relationships,  that  it  is  safe  to  care,  that  it  is safe  to  relate  to  the  other  as  a  person  for  whom  we  have  positive feelings.\n4. Another question the importance of which I  have learned  in my own experience  is:  Can I be strong  enough as  a person to  be  separate from  the  other? Can  I  be  a  sturdy  respecter  of  my  own  feelings, my  own  needs,  as  well  as  his? Can  I  own  and,  if  need  be,  express my  own  feelings  as  something  belonging  to  me  and  separate  from his feelings? Am I  strong enough in my  own  separateness that I will not  be  downcast  by  his  depression,  frightened  by  his  fear,  nor  en­ gulfed by his  dependency? Is  my  inner self  hardy  enough  to  realize that  I  am  not  destroyed  by  his  anger,  taken  over  by  his  need  for dependence,  nor  enslaved  by  his  love,  but  that  I  exist  separate  from him  with  feelings  and  rights  of  my  own? When  I  can  freely  feel this  strength  of  being  a  separate  person,  then  I find  that  I can  let myself  go  much  more  deeply  in  understanding  and  accepting  him because I  am not fearful  of losing myself.\n5.  The next question  is closely related. Am  I  secure enough\nwithin  myself  to  permit  him  his  separateness? Can  I  permit  him  to be  what he  is - honest  or  deceitful,  infantile  or adult,  despairing  or ovcr-confident? Can I give  him the freedom to be? Or do  I  feel  that he  should  follow  my  advice,  or  remain  somewhat  dependent  on  me, or  mold  himself  after  me? In  this  connection  I  think  of  the  inter­ esting small study by  Farson  (6)  which  found  that  the  less  well  ad­ justed  and  less  competent  counselor  tends  to  induce  conformity  to himself,  to  have  clients  who  model  themselves  after  him. On  the other  hand,  the  better  adjusted  and  more  competent  counselor  can interact  with  a  client  through  many  interviews  without  interfering with the freedom of the client to develop a  personality quite  separate from  that  of  his  therapist. I  should  prefer  to  be  in  this  latter  class, whether  as  parent  or  supervisor  or  counselor.\n6. Another question  I  ask  myself  is:  Can  I  let  myself  enter  fully into  the  world  of  his  feelings  and  personal  meanings  and  see  these as  he  does? Can  I  step  into  his  private  world  so  completely  that  I lose  all  desire  to  evaluate  or  judge  it? Can  I  enter  it  so  sensitively that  I  can  move  about  in  it  freely,  without  trampling  on  meanings which  are  precious  to  him? Can  I  sense  it  so  accurately  that  I  can catch  not  only  the  meanings  of  his  experience  which are  obvious  to him,  but those meanings  w hich are  only  implicit,  which  he  secs only dimly  or  as  confusion? Can  I  extend  this  understanding  without limit? I  think  o f the client who said,  ' W henever I  find someone  who understands  a  part  of  me  at  the  time,  then  it  never  fails  that  a  point is  reachcd  w here  I  know  they're  not  understanding  me  again  .  .  . What I've  looked  for  so  hard  is  for  someone  to  understand.'\nFor  myself  I  find  it  easier  to  feel  this  kind  of  understanding,  and to  communicate  it,  to  individual  clients  than  to  students  in  a  class or  staff  members  in  a  group  in  which  I  am  involved. There  is  a strong  temptation  to  set  students  ' straight,'  or  to  point  out  to  a staff  member  the  errors  in  his  thinking. Yet  when  I  can  permit myself  to  understand  in  these  situations,  it  is  mutually  rewarding. And with clients in  therapy,  I am  often  impressed  with  the  fact  that even  a  minimal  amount  of  empathic  understanding - a  bumbling and  faulty  attempt  to  catch  the  confused  complexity  of  the  client's meaning- is helpful,  though  there  is  no  doubt that  it  is  most  help­ ful  when I  can see  and  formulate  clearly  the meanings  in  his  experi­\nencing  which  for  him  have  been  unclear  and  tangled.\n7. Still  another  issue  is  whether  I  can  be  acceptant  of  each  facet of  this  other  person  which  he  presents  to  me. Can  I  receive  him  as he  is? Can  I  communicate  this  attitude? Or  can  I  only  receive  him conditionally,  acceptant  of  some  aspects  of  his  feelings  and  silently or openly  disapproving of other  aspects? It  has  been  my  experience that  when  my  attitude  is  conditional, then  he  cannot  change  or grow  in  those  respects  in  which  I  cannot  fully  receive  him. And when - afterward  and  sometimes  too  late - I  try  to  discover  why I  have been unable  to accept him  in every  respect,  I  usually  discover that  it  is  because  I have  been  frightened  or  threatened  in  myself by some aspect of his feelings.  If I am to be more helpful, then I must myself grow  and  accept myself  in  these  respects.\n8. A  very practical  issue  is  raised  by  the  question:  Can  I  act  with sufficient sensitivity  in  the  relationship  that  my  behavior  will  not  be perceived as a threat? The work we are beginning to  do  in studying the  physiological  concomitants  of  psychotherapy  confirms  the  re­ search  by  Dittes  in  indicating  how  easily  individuals  are  threatened at  a  physiological  level. The  psychogalvanic  reflex -  the  measure of skin conductance - takes a sharp dip when the therapist responds with  some  word  which  is  just  a little stronger  than  the client's feelings. And  to  a  phrase  such  as,  ' M y  you  do  look  upset,'  the needle  swings  almost  off  the  paper. My  desire  to  avoid  even  such minor  threats  is  not  due  to  a  hypersensitivity  about  my  client. It  is simply  due  to  the  conviction  based  on  experience  that  if  I  can  free him as completely as possible from external threat,  then  he  can  begin to  experience  and  to  deal  with  the  internal  feelings  and  conflicts which  he  finds threatening  within  himself.\n9. A  specific  aspect  of  the  preceding  question  but  an  important one  is: Can  I  free  him  from  the  threat  of  external  evaluation? In almost every  phase  of our  lives -  at  home,  at  school,  at work - we find  ourselves  under  the  rewards  and  punishments  of  external  judg­ ments. ' That's good' ; ' that's naughty.' ' That's worth  an  A' ; ' that's  a  failure.' ' That's  good  counseling' ;  ' that's  poor  counsel­ ing.' Such  judgments  are  a  part  of  our  lives  from  infancy  to  old age.  I  believe they  have a  certain social  usefulness  to  institutions and organizations  such  as  schools  and  professions. Like  everyone  else\nI  find  myself  all  too  often  making  such  evaluations. But,  in  my  ex­ perience,  they  do  not make  for  personal  growth  and  hence  I  do  not believe  that  they  are  a  part  of  a helping  relationship. Curiously enough  a  positive  evaluation  is  as  threatening  in  the  long  run  as  a negative  one,  since  to  inform  someone  that  he  is  good  implies  that you also  have  the right  to tell  him  he  is  bad. So I  have  come  to  feel that the  more  I  can  keep a  relationship  free  of  judgment and  evalua­ tion,  the  more  this  will  permit  the  other  person  to  reach  the  point where  he  recognizes  that  the  locus  of  evaluation,  the  center  of  re­ sponsibility,  lies  within  himself. The  meaning  and  value  of  his  ex­ perience  is  in  the  last  analysis  something  which  is  up  to  him,  and no  amount  of  external  judgment  can  alter  this. So  I  should  like  to work toward a relationship in which  I  am not,  even  in  my own feel­ ings,  evaluating  him. This  I  believe  can  set  him  free  to  be  a  selfresponsible  person.\n10. One  last  question:  Can  I  meet  this  other  individual  as  a  per­ son  who  is  in  process  of  becoming,  or  will  I  be  bound  by  his  past and  by  my  past? If,  in  my  encounter  with  him,  I  am  dealing  with him  as  an  immature  child,  an  ignorant  student,  a  neurotic  personal­ ity,  or  a  psychopath,  each  of  these  concepts  of  mine  limits  what  he can  be  in  the  relationship. Martin  Buber,  the  existentialist  philoso­ pher  of  the  University  of  Jerusalem,  has  a  phrase,  ' confirming  the other,' which has  had meaning for me.  He  says 'Confirming means . . . accepting  the  whole  potentiality  of  the  other.  . . .   I  can  rec­ ognize  in  him,  know  in  him,  the  person  he  has  been  .  .  .  created  to become.  . . .   I  confirm  him  in  myself,  and  then  in  him,  in  relation to  this  potentiality  that  .  .  .  can  now  be  developed,  can  evolve'  (3). If  I accept  the  other  person  as  something  fixed,  already  diagnosed and classified, already shaped by his past,  then I  am doing my part to confirm  this  limited  hypothesis. If  I  accept  him  as  a  process  of  be­ coming,  then  I  am  doing  what  I  can  to  confirm  or  make  real  his potentialities.\nIt is at  this  point  that  I see  Verplanck,  Lindsley,  and  Skinner, working  in  operant  conditioning,  coming  together  with  Buber,  the philosopher  or  mystic. At  least  they  come  together  in  principle, in  an  odd  way. If  I see  a  relationship  as  only  an  opportunity  to reinforce  certain  types  of  words  or  opinions  in  the  other,  then  I\ntend  to  confirm  him  as  an  object -  a  basically  mechanical,  manipu­ l a t e   object. And  if  I  see  this  as  his  potentiality,  he  tends  to  act  in ways  which  support  this  hypothesis. If,  on  the  other  hand,  I  see  a relationship as an opportunity to  ' reinforce' all that he  is, the person that  he  is  with  all  his  existent  potentialities,  then  he  tends  to  act  in ways  which  support  this  hypothesis. I have  then - to  use  Buber's term - confirmed  him  as  a  living  person,  capable  of  creative  inner development. Personally  I  prefer  this  second  type  of  hypothesis.",

Endeavoring  to  keep  that  knowledge  in  mind  I  then  took  up  the kind  of  questions  which  arise  from  an  inner  and  subjective  point  of view as  I  enter,  as  a  person,  into  relationships. If  I  could,  in  myself, answer  all  the  questions  I  have  raised  in  the  affirmative,  then  I  be­ lieve  that  any  relationships  in  which  I  was  involved  would  be  help­ ing  relationships,  would  involve  growth. But  I  cannot  give  a  posi­ tive  answer  to  most  of  these  questions. I can  only  work  in  the direction  of the  positive  answer.\nThis  has  raised  in  my  mind  the  strong  suspicion  that  the  optimal helping  relationship  is  the  kind  of  relationship  created  by  a  person who  is  psychologically  mature. Or  to  put  it  in  another  way,  the degree to which I can create relationships which facilitate the growth of  others  as  separate  persons  is  a measure  of  the  growth  I  have achieved  in  myself. In  some  respects  this  is  a  disturbing  thought, but  it  is  also  a  promising  or  challenging  one. It  would  indicate  that if  I  am  interested  in  creating  helping  relationships  I  have  a  fascinat­ ing  lifetime  job  ahead  of  me,  stretching  and  developing  my  poten­ tialities in  the direction  of growth.\nI  am  left  with  the  uncomfortable  thought  that  what  I  have  been working out  for  myself  in  this  paper  may  have  little  relationship  to your  interests  and  your  work. If  so,  I  regret  it. But  I  am  at  least partially  comforted  by  the  fact  that  all  of  us  who  are  working  in the  field  of  human  relationships  and  trying  to  understand  the  basic orderliness  of that  field  are  engaged  in  the  most  crucial  enterprise  in today's world.  If we are  thoughtfully trying to  understand our tasks\nas  administrators,  teachers,  educational  counselors,  vocational  coun­ selors,  therapists,  then  we  are  working  on  the  problem  which  will determine  the  future  of  this  planet. For  it  is  not  upon  the  physical sciences that  the  future  will  depend. It  is  upon  us  who  are  trying  to understand  and  deal  with  the  interactions  between  human  beings - who are trying to  create  helping relationships. So  I  hope  that the questions  I  ask  of  myself  will  be  of  some  use  to  you  in  gaining  un­ derstanding and  perspective  as you  endeavor,  in  your way,  to  facili­ tate  growth  in  your relationships.",

As  one  part  of  this  four-day  visit 1  was  asked  to  talk  to  a  forum  of  faculty  and  staff. I  was  eager  to speak  of psychotherapy  in a  way  which  wotdd make  sense  to  phys­ ical scientists, and it seemed to me a summary  of the research findings in  regard  to therapy  might  communicate. On  the  other  hand  I wished  to  make  very  clear  that  the  personal  subjective  relationship is  at  least  an  equally  fundamental  part  of  therapeutic  change. So  1 endeavored  to  present  both  sides. I  have  made  some  changes  in  the paper,  but  this  is  essentially  what  I  presented  to  the  audience  at  Cal T   ech.\nI  was  pleased  that  the  presentation  seemed  well  received,  but  1 have  been  even  more  pleased  that  since  that  time  a  number  of  in­ dividuals  who  have  experienced  therapy  have  read  the  manuscript and  seem  highly  enthusiastic  about  the  description  (in  the  second half  of  the  paper)  of  the  client's  inner  experience  of  therapy. This gratifies me,  because  I  am  especially  eager  to  capture  the  way  ther­ apy  feels and seems  to  the  client.\nI n t h e f ie l d of  psychotherapy  considerable  progress  has  been made  in  the  last  decade  in  measuring  the  outcomes  of  therapy  in the  personality  and  behavior  of  the  client. In  the  last  two  or  three years  additional  progress  has  been  made in identifying  the  basic conditions in the  therapeutic relationship  which bring about therapy, which  facilitate  personal  development  in  the  direction  of  psycho­ logical  maturity. Another  way  of saying  this  is  that  we  have  made progress in determining those ingredients in a relationship which pro­ mote  personal  growth.\nPsychotherapy  does  not  supply  the  motivation  for  such  develop­ ment or  growth. This  seems  to  be  inherent  in  the  organism,  just  as we  find  a  similar  tendency  in  the  human  animal  to  develop  and mature  physically,  provided  minimally  satisfactory  conditions  are provided. But  therapy  does  play  an  extremely  important  part  in releasing and facilitating the tendency of the organism toward psychological development  or  maturity,  when  this  tendency  has been  blocked.",

        "text": "I  would  like,  in  the  first  part  of  this  talk,  to  summarize  what  we know  of  the  conditions  which  facilitate  psychological  growth,  and something  of  what  we  know  of  the  process  and  characteristics  of that  psychological  growth. Let  me  explain  what  I  mean  when  I say  that  I  am  going  to  summarize  what  we  ' know.' I  mean  that  I will limit  my  statements  to  those for which  we  have  objective empirical  evidence. For example,  I  will  talk  about  the  conditions  of psychological growth.  For each statement one or more studies could\nbe cited  in  which  it  was  found  that  changes  occurred  in  the  individ­ ual  when  these  conditions  were present  which  did  not  occur  in situations  where  these  conditions  were  absent,  or  were  present  to  a much  lesser  degree. As one  investigator states,  we  have  made  prog­ ress in identifying the primary change-producing agents which facilitate  the  alteration  of  personality  and  of  behavior  in  the  direc­ tion  of  personal  development. It should  of  course  be  added  that this  knowledge,  like  all  scientific  knowledge,  is  tentative  and  surely incomplete,  and  is  certain  to  be  modified,  contradicted  in  part,  and supplemented  by  the  painstaking  work  of  the  future. Nevertheless there is no reason to be apologetic for the small but hard-won knowl­ edge  which  we  currently  possess.\nI  would  like  to  give  this  knowledge  which  we  have  gained  in  the very  briefest  fashion,  and  in  everyday  language.\nIt has  been  found  that  personal  change  is  facilitated  when  the psychotherapist is what he w, when  in the relationship with  his client he  is  genuine  and  without  ' front'   or  facade,  openly  being  the  feel­ ings  and  attitudes  which  at  that  moment  are  flowing  in  him. We have coined the term 'congruence'  to try to describe this condition. By  this  we  mean  that  the  feelings  the  therapist  is  experiencing  are available to him, available to his awareness, and  he  is able to  live  these feelings,  be  them,  and  able  to  communicate  them  if appropriate. No one  fully  achieves  this  condition,  yet  the  more  the  therapist  is  able to  listen  acceptantly  to  what  is  going  on  within  himself,  and  the more  he  is  able  to  be  the  complexity  of  his  feelings,  without  fear, the  higher  the  degree  of  his  congruence.\nTo give  a  commonplace  example,  each  of  us  senses  this  quality  in people  in  a  variety  of  ways. One  of  the  things  which  offends  us about  radio  and  T V  commercials  is  that it  is  often  perfectly  evident from  the  tone  of  voice  that  the  announcer  is  ' putting  on,'  playing a  role,  saying  something  he  doesn't  feel. This  is  an  example  of  in­ congruence.  On the  other hand each of us  knows  individuals  whom we  somehow  trust  because  we  sense  that  they  are  being  what  they are,  that we  are  dealing with the  person  himself,  not  with  a  polite  or professional  front. It  is  this  quality  of  congruence  which  we  sense which  research  has  found  to  be  associated  with  successful  therapy.\nThe  more  genuine  and  congruent  the  therapist  in  the  relationship, the  more  probability  there  is  that change  in personality in  the  client will  occur.\nNow  the  second  condition. When  the  therapist  is  experiencing a warm, positive  and acceptant  attitude  toward what is in the  client, this  facilitates  change. It  involves  the therapist's  genuine  willing­ ness  for  the  client  to  be  whatever  feeling  is  going  on  in  him  at  that moment, - fear, confusion, pain,  pride, anger, hatred,  love, courage, or  awe. It  means  that  the  therapist  cares  for  the  client,  in  a  nonpossessive  way. It  means  that  he  prizes  the  client  in  a  total  rather than  a  conditional  way. By  this  I mean  that  he  does  not  simply accept  the  client  when  he  is  behaving  in  certain  ways,  and  disap­ prove of  him when  he  behaves in  other ways.  It means  an  outgoing positive feeling without reservations, without evaluations. The term  we  have  come  to  use  for  this  is  unconditional  positive  regard. Again  research  studies  show  that  the  more  this  attitude  is  experi­ enced by the therapist,  the more  likelihood  there  is  that  therapy  will be  successful.\nThe  third  condition  we  may  call  empathic  understanding. When the  therapist  is  sensing the  feelings  and  personal  meanings which  the client  is  experiencing  in  each  moment,  when  he  can  perceive  these from  ' inside,'  as  they  seem  to  the  client,  and  when  he  can  success­ fully  communicate  something  of  that  understanding  to  his  client, then  this  third  condition  is  fulfilled.\nI  suspect each  of us has  discovered  that  this kind  of understanding is  extremely  rare. We neither  receive  it  nor  offer it  with  any  great frequency.  Instead we  offer another  type  of  understanding which is very  different. ' I  understand  what  is  wrong  with  you' ;  ' I  under­ stand  what  makes  you  act  that  w ay' ;  or  ' I  too  have  experienced your  trouble  and  I  reacted  very  differently' ;  these  are  the  types  of understanding which we  usually  offer  and  receive,  an evaluative  un­ derstanding  from  the  outside. But  when  someone  understands  how it  feels  and  seems to  be  me, without  wanting to  analyze  me or  judge me, then I  can blossom and grow in  that climate.  And research bears out  this  common  observation. When  the  therapist  can  grasp  the moment-to-moment  experiencing  which  occurs  in  the  inner  world of the client as the client  sees it  and  feels it, without losing the separ­\nateness  of  his  own  identity  in  this  empathic  process,  then  change  is likely  to  occur.\nStudies with a variety of clients show that when  these three condi­ tions  occur  in  the  therapist,  and  when  they  are  to  some  degree  per­ ceived  by  the  client,  therapeutic  movement  ensues,  the  client  finds himself  painfully  but  definitely  learning  and  growing,  and  both  he and his therapist regard the outcome as successful.  It seems from  our studies  that  it  is  attitudes  such  as  these  rather  than  the  therapist's technical  knowledge  and  skill,  which  are  primarily  responsible  for therapeutic  change.",

        "text": "You  may  well  ask,  ' But  why  does  a  person  who  is  seeking  help change  for  the better  when  he  is  involved,  over a  period  of  time,  in a  relationship  with  a  therapist  which  contains  these  elements? How does  this  come  about?' Let  me  try  very  briefly to answer  this question.\nThe reactions of the client who experiences  for a  time the  kind of therapeutic  relationship  which  I  have  described  are  a  reciprocal  of the  therapist's  attitudes. In  the  first  place,  as  he  finds  someone  else listening  acceptantly  to  his  feelings,  he  little  by  little  becomes  able to  listen  to  himself. He begins  to  receive  the  communications  from within  himself - to  realize  that  he  is  angry,  to  recognize  when  he is  frightened,  even  to  realize  when  he  is  feeling  courageous. As  he becomes more  open to what is going on within  him he becomes  able to  listen  to  feelings  which  he  has  always  denied  and  repressed. He can  listen  to  feelings  which  have  seemed  to  him  so  terrible,  or  so disorganizing,  or  so  abnormal,  or  so  shameful, that  he  has  never been  able  to  recognize  their existence  in  himself.\nWhile  he  is  learning to  listen  to  himself  he  also  becomes  more  acceptant  of  himself. As  he  expresses  more  and  more  of  the  hidden and  awful  aspects  of  himself,  he  finds  the  therapist  showing  a  con­ sistent  and  unconditional  positive  regard  for  him  and  his  feelings. Slowly  he  moves  toward  taking  the  same  attitude  toward  himself, accepting  himself  as  he  is,  and  therefore  ready  to  move  forward  in the  process  of  becoming.\nAnd  finally  as  he  listens  more  accurately  to  the  feelings  within,\nand  becomes  less  evaluative  and  more  acceptant  toward  himself,  he also  moves  toward  greater congruence.  He  finds  it  possible  to move out  from  behind  the  facades  he  has  used,  to  drop  his  defensive  be­ haviors,  and  more  openly  to  be  what  he  truly  is. As  these  changes occur, as he becomes  more  self-aware, more  self-acceptant, less defensive  and  more  open,  he  finds  that  he  is  at  last  free  to  change and  grow  in  the  directions  natural  to  the  human  organism.",

        "text": "Now  let  me  put  something  of  this  process  in  factual  statements, each  statement  borne  out  by  empirical  research. We know  that the client  shows  movement  on  each  of  a  number  of  continua. Starting from  wherever  he  may  be  on  each  continuum  I  will  mention,  he moves toward the  upper  end.\nIn  regard  to  feelings  and  personal  meanings,  he  moves  away  from a  state  in  which  feelings  are  unrecognized,  unowned,  unexpressed. He  moves  toward  a  flow  in  which  ever-changing  feelings  are  ex­ perienced  in  the  moment,  knowingly  and  acceptingly,  and  may  be accurately  expressed.\nThe  process  involves  a  change  in  the  manner  of  his  experiencing. Initially  he  is  remote  from  his  experiencing. An  example  would  be the  intellectualizing  person  who  talks  about  himself  and  his  feelings in  abstractions,  leaving  you  wondering  what  is  actually  going  on within  him. From  such  remoteness  he  moves  toward  an  immediacy of  experiencing  in  which  he  lives  openly  in  his  experiencing,  and knows that  he  can  turn  to  it  to  discover  its  current  meanings.\nThe  process  involves  a  loosening  of the  cognitive  maps  of  experi­ ence. From  construing  experience  in  rigid  ways,  which  are  per­ ceived  as  external  facts,  the  client  moves  toward  developing  chang­ ing,  loosely  held  construings  of  meaning  in  experience,  constructs which  are  modifiable  by  each  new  experience.\nIn  general,  the  evidence  shows  that  the  process  moves  away  from fixity, remoteness  from  feelings  and experience, rigidity of selfconcept,  remoteness  from  people,  impersonality  of  functioning. It moves  toward  fluidity,  changingness,  immediacy  of  feelings  and  ex­ perience, acceptance  of  feelings and experience, tentativeness of constructs, discovery of a changing self in one's changing experience,\nrealness  and  closeness  of  relationships, a unity  and  integration  of functioning.\nWe  are  continually  learning  more  about  this  process  by  which change comes about,  and I  am  not  sure that  this  very  brief summary conveys  much  of  the  richness  of  our  findings.",

        "text": "But let  me  turn  to  the  outcomes of  therapy,  to  the  relatively  last­ ing  changes  which  occur. As  in  the  other  things  I  have  said  I  will limit  myself  to statements  borne  out  by  research  evidence. The client  changes  and  reorganizes  his  concept  of  himself. He  moves away  from  perceiving  himself  as  unacceptable  to himself,  as un­ worthy  of  respect,  as  having  to  live  by  the  standards  of  others. He moves  toward  a  conception  of  himself  as  a  person  of  worth,  as  a self-directing  person,  able  to  form  his  standards and  values  upon  the basis  of  his  own  experience. He  develops  much  more  positive  at­ titudes  toward  himself. One  study showed  that  at  the  beginning of therapy  current  attitudes  toward  self  were  four  to one  negative, but  in  the  final fifth  of  therapy  self-attitudes  were  twice  as  often positive  as  negative. He  becomes  less  defensive,  and  hence  more open  to  his  experience  of  himself  and  of  others. He  becomes  more realistic  and  differentiated  in  his  perceptions. He  improves  in  his psychological adjustment, whether this is measured by the Rorschach test, the Thematic  Apperception  Test,  the  counselor's  rating,  or other  indices. His  aims  and  ideals  for  himself  change  so  that  they are  more  achievable. The  initial  discrepancy  between  the  self  that he  is  and  the  self  that  he  wants  to  be  is  greatly  diminished. Tension of  all types  is  reduced - physiological  tension,  psychological  dis­ comfort,  anxiety. He  perceives  other  individuals  with  more  realism and  more  acceptance. He  describes his  own  behavior  as  being  more mature and,  what is more  important,  he  is seen  by  others  who  know him  well  as  behaving  in  a  more  mature  fashion.\nNot  only  arc  these  changes  shown  by  various  studies  to  occur during  the  period  of  therapy,  but  carcful  follow-up  studies  con­ ducted  six  to  eighteen  months  following  the  conclusion  of  therapy indicate  that these  changes  persist.\nPerhaps  the  facts  I  have  given  will  make  it  clear  why  I  feel  that\nwe  are  approaching  the  point  where  we  can  write  a  genuine  equa­ tion  in  this  subtle  area  of  interpersonal  relationships. Using  all  of the  research  findings we  have,  here  is  a  tentative  formulation  of  the crude equation which I believe contains the  facts.\nThe more that the client perceives the  therapist as real  or  genuine, as  empathic,  as  having  an  unconditional  regard  for  him,  the  more the  client  will  move  away  from  a  static,  fixed,  unfeeling,  impersonal type  of  functioning,  and  the  more  he  will  move  toward  a  way  of functioning  marked  by  a  fluid, changing,  acceptant  experiencing of  differentiated  personal  feelings. The  conscquence  of  this  move­ ment is  an  alteration  in  personality  and  behavior  in  the  direction  of psychic  health  and  maturity  and  more  realistic  relationships  to  self, others,  and the environment.",

But  let me  now  try to  approach  it  from  the  inside,  and  with­ out  ignoring  this  factual  knowledge,  present  this  equation  ns  it  oc­ curs  subjectively  in  both  therapist  and  client.

I  would  like  to  go  with  him  on  the  fearful  journey  into  himself, into  the  buried fear, and  hate, and  love  which  he has never  been  able to  let  flow  in  him. I recognize  that  this  is  a  very  human  and  un­ predictable  journey  for me, as well  as  for him,  and  that I  may, with­ out  even  knowing  my  fear,  shrink  away  within  myself,  from  some of the  feelings  he  discovers.

I  want  fully  to  accept  these  feelings in  him,  and  yet  I  hope  also  that  my  own  real  feelings  will  show through  so  clearly  that  in  time he  cannot  fail to perccive  them.

What I am and what I feel are good enough to be a basis for therapy, if  I  can  transparently  be  what  I  am  and  what  I  feel  in  relationship to  him.

It  makes  me  feel  that  I  want  to  go further,  exploring  me,  perhaps  expressing  more  of  myself. I find\nhim a sort of companion as I do this - he  seems  really to understand. 'But  now  I'm  getting  frightened again, and this time deeply frightened. I  didn't  realize  that  exploring  the  unknown  recesses  of myself  would  make  me  feel  feelings  I've  never  experienced  before. It's very  strange  because  in  one  way  these  aren't  new  feelings. I sense  that  they've  always  been  there. But  they  seem  so  bad  and disturbing  I've  never  dared  to  let  them  flow  in  me. And  now  as I  live  these  feelings  in  the  hours  with  him,  I  feel  terribly  shaky,  as though my world is falling apart. It  used  to  be  sure  and  firm. Now it  is  loose,  permeable  and  vulnerable. It  isn't  pleasant  to  feel  things I've  always  been  frightened  of  before. It's  his  fault. Yet  curiously I'm eager to  see  him  and  I  feel  more  safe  when  I'm  with  him.\n' I don't  know  who  I  am  any  more,  but  sometimes  when  I  feel things I  seem  solid  and  real  for  a  moment. I'm  troubled  by  the  con­ tradictions  I  find  in  myself - I  act  one  way  and  feel  another - I think  one  thing  and  feel  another. It  is  very  disconcerting. It's  also sometimes adventurous and exhilarating to be trying to discover who I  am. Sometimes I  catch myself feeling that  perhaps the  person  I  am is worth being, whatever that means.\n' I'm  beginning  to  find  it  very  satisfying,  though  often  painful,  to share  just  what  it  is  I'm  feeling  at  this  moment. You  know,  it  is really  helpful  to  try  to  listen  to  myself,  to  hear  what  is  going  on  in me. I'm  not  so  frightened  any  more  of  what  is  going  on  in  me. It seems  pretty  trust-worthy. I  use  some  of  my  hours  with  him  to  dig deep  into  myself  to  know  what  I  am  feeling. It's  scary  work,  but I want  to  know.  And  I  do  trust  him  most  of  the  time,  and  that  helps. I  feel pretty  vulnerable  and  raw,  but  I  know  he  doesn't  want to  hurt me, and I  even believe  he cares. It  occurs to  me as  I  try  to  let myself down and  down,  deep  into myself,  that  maybe  if  I  could  sense  what is  going  on  in  me,  and  could  realize  its  meaning,  I  would  know  who I am, and I would also  know what to do.  At least I  feel this knowing sometimes with him.\n' I  can  even  tell  him  just  how  I'm  feeling toward  him  at  any  given moment and  instead  of this killing  the  relationship,  as  I  used  to  fear, it  seems  to  deepen  it. Do  you  suppose  I  could  be  my  feelings  with other  people  also? Perhaps  that  wouldn't  be  too  dangerous  either.\n' You  know,  I  feel  as  if  I'm  floating  along  on  the  current  of  life,",

Or could I be myself this way outside of this relationship? I  wonder. I  wonder. Perhaps I  could.'\nWhat  I  have  just  presented  doesn't  happen  rapidly. It  may  take years. It  may  not, for  reasons  we do  not  understand  very  well, happen  at  all. But  at  least  this  m ay  suggest  an  inside  view  of  the factual  picture  I  have  tried  to  present  of  the  process  of  psycho­ therapy as it occurs in both  the  therapist and  his  client.\nP A R T I I I\nThe  Process  of Becoming a  Person\nI have  observed  the  process  by  which an  individual  grow s  and  changes  in  a  therapeutic  relationship.\n5\nSome  of the  Directions Evident  in Therapy\nI n Part II , although there are some  brief descriptions of the  process of  change  in  the  client,  the  m ajor  focus  was  on  the  relationship which makes these  changes possible.  In  this and the  following chap­ ter,  the  77iaterial  deals  in  a  much  more  specific  way  with  the  nature of the client's experience of change in himself.\nI have  a  personal  fondness  for  this  chapter. It was  written  in 1951-52,  at  a  time  when  I  was  making  a  real  effort  to  let  myself sense,  and  then  express, the  phenomena  which  seemed  central  to therapy. My  book,  Client-Centered  Therapy,  had  just  been  pub­ lished,  but  I  was  already  dissatisfied with  the  chapter  on  the  process of  therapy,  which  had  of  course  been  written  about  two  years  pre­ viously. I  wanted  to  find  a  more  dynamic  way  of  communicating what happens to the person.\nSo  I  took  the  case  of  one  client  whose  therapy  had  had  much significance  for  me,  one  which  I  was  also  studying  from   a  research pohit  of view, and using  this as a  basis,  tried  to  express  the  tentative perceptions  of  the  therapeutic  process  which  were  emerging  in  me. I  felt  very  bold,  and  very  unsure  of  myself,  in  pointing  out  that  in successful  therapy  clients  seem  to  come  to  have  real  affection  for themselves.  / felt  even  more uncertain in voicing  the  hypothesis that the core of man's nature is essentially  positive. I could not then fore-\n74 T he  P rocess  of  B eco m in g   a  P erson see  that  both  of  these  points  'would  receive  increasing  support  from\nmy  experience.\nT he process of psychotherapy,  as we have come to know it from a  client-centered  orientation,  is  a  unique  and  dynamic  experi­ ence,  different  for  each  individual,  yet  exhibiting  a  lawfulness  and order  which  is  astonishing  in  its  generality. As  I  have  become  in­ creasingly  impressed  by  the  inevitability  of  many  aspects  of  this process,  I  likewise  grow  increasingly  annoyed  at  the  type  of  ques­ tions  which  are  so  commonly  raised  in  regard  to  it:  'Will  it  cure  a compulsion  neurosis?' ' Surely  you  don't  claim  that  it  will  erase  a basic  psychotic  condition?' ' Is  it  suitable  for  dealing  with  marital problems?'  'Does  it  apply  to  stutterers  or  homosexuals?' ' Are  the cures  permanent?'  These questions, and others like them,  are under­ standable  and  legitimate  just  as  it  would  be  reasonable  to  inquire whether  gamma  rays  would  be  an  appropriate  cure  for  chilblains. They  are  however,  it  seems  to  me,  the  wrong  questions  to  ask  if we  are  trying  to  further  a  deep  knowledge  of  what  psychotherapy is,  or  what  it  may  accomplish. In  this  chapter  I  should  like  to  ask what  appears  to  me  a  sounder  question  in  regard  to  this  fascinating and lawful  process we term  therapy, and to attempt a  partial answer.\nLet  me  introduce  my  question  in  this  way. Whether  by  chance, by  insightful  understanding,  by  scientific  knowledge,  by  artistry  in human relaionships,  or  by a  combination of all  of these  elements,  we have  learned  how  to  initiate  a  describable  process  which  appears  to have  a  core  of  sequential,  orderly  events,  which  tend  to  be  similar from one client to  another.  W e  know  at  least  something  of the  attitudinal conditions for getting this process under way.  W e know that if  the  therapist  holds  within  himself  attitudes  of  deep  respect  and full  acceptance  for  this  client  as  he  is,  and  similar  attitudes  toward the  client's  potentialities  for  dealing  with  himself  and  his  situations; if these  attitudes  are  suffused  with  a  sufficient  warmth,  which  trans-\nFrom Psychotherapy:  Theory  and  Research, edited  by  O.

Then,  instead  of  trying  to  insist  that  this  process  serve  the ends we have in mind  (no matter  how  laudable  those  goals may  be), let  us  ask  the  only  question  by  which  science  can  genuinely  be  ad­ vanced.  This  question  is:  ' W hat  is  the  nature  of  this  process,  what seem  to  be  its  inherent  characteristics,  what  direction  or  directions does  it  take, and  what,  if  any,  are the  natural  end-points  of  the process?' When  Benjamin  Franklin  observed  the  spark coming from  the  key  on  his  kite-string,  he  did  not,  fortunately,  fall  under the spell  of  its  immediate and  practical  uses. Instead,  he  began  to  in­ quire  into  the  basic  process  which  made  such  a  phenomenon  pos­ sible. Though  many  of  the  answers  which  were  put  forward  were full of specific errors, the search was fruitful,  because  the right  ques­ tion was being asked.  Thus  I  am making a  plea  that we  ask the  same question  of  psychotherapy,  and  ask  it  with  open  mind - that  we endeavor to  describe,  study,  and  understand  the  basic  process  which underlies  therapy,  rather  than  attempting to  warp  that  process  to  fit our clinical  needs,  or  our preconceived dogma,  or the evidence  from some  other  field. Let  us  patiently  examine  it  for  what  it  is,  in  it­ self.\nI have  recently  made  an  attempt  to  begin  such  a  description  of client-centered  therapy  (3). I  will  not  repeat  this  description  here, except  to  say  that  from  the  clinical  and research  evidence  there seem  to  emerge  certain  persistent  characteristics  in  the  process:  the increase  in  insightful  statements,  in  maturity  of  reported  behavior, in  positive attitudes, as  therapy  progresses;  the  changes  in  perception of, and acceptance of, the self; the incorporation of previously denied experience into the self-structure;  the  shift  in  the  locus  of evaluation from  outside  to  inside  the  self;  the  changes  in  the  therapeutic  rela­ tionship;  and  characteristic  changes  in  personality  structure,  in  be­ havior, and  in physiological  condition. Faulty as some  of  these descriptions may prove  to  be,  they  arc  an  attempt  to  understand  the process  of  client-centered  therapy  in  its  own  terms,  as  revealed  in clinical experience, in electrically  recorded  verbatim cases,  and  in the\nforty  or  more  research  studies  which  have  been  completed  in  this area.\nMy  purpose  in  this  paper  is  to  push  out  beyond  this  material  and to formulate  certain  trends  in therapy  which  have received  less emphasis. I should  like  to  describe  some  of  the  directions  and  end points which appear to  be  inherent  in  the  therapeutic  process,  which we have only  recently  begun  to  discern  with  clarity,  which seem  to represent significant learnings,  and  on  which  research  is,  as  yet,  non­ existent. In  an  attempt  to  convey  meanings  more  adequately  I  shall use  illustrative  material  from  recorded  interviews  from  one  case. I shall also limit my  discussion to the process of client-centered therapy  since  I  have  reluctantly  come  to  concede  the  possibility thnt  the  process,  directions,  and  end  points  of  therapy  may  differ  in different therapeutic orientations.",

        "text": "One aspect  of  the  process  of  therapy  which  is  evident  in  all  cases, might  be  termed  the  awareness  of  experience,  or  even  ' the  experi­ encing of experience.'  I  have  here  labelled  it  as  the  experiencing of the self, though this also falls short  of being an  accurate  term. In  the security  of  the  relationship  with  a  client-centered  therapist,  in  the absence of any actual or implied  threat to self,  the client can  let him­ self examine  various aspects of  his experience  as  they  actually  feel  to him,  as they are apprehended through his sensory  and  visceral equip­ ment,  without  distorting  them  to  fit  the  existing  conccpt  of  self. Many of  these  prove  to  be  in  extreme  contradiction  to  the  concept ©f self,  and  could  not  ordinarily  be  experienced  in  their  fullness,  but in  this  safe  relationship  they  can  be  permitted  to  seep  through  into awareness without distortion.  Thus they often  follow  the  schematic pattern, ' I am  thus and so, but I  experience this  feeling which is very inconsistent  with  what  I  am' ;  ' I  love  my  parents,  but  I  experience some  surprising  bitterness  toward  them  at  times' ;  ' I  am  really  no good,  but  sometimes  I  seem  to  feel  that  I'm  better  than  everyone else.' Thus  at  first  the  expression  is  that  ' I  am  a  self  which  is  dif­ ferent  from  a  part  of  my  experience.' Later  this  changes  to  the tentative pattern,  ' Perhaps  I am  several  quite  different selves,  or per­ haps my self contains more contradictions  than I  had dreamed.'  Still\nlater  the  pattern  changes  to  some  such  pattern  as  this:  ' I  was  sure that  I  could  not  be  my  experience - it  was  too  contradictory but  now  I  am  beginning  to  believe  that  I  can  be  all  of  my  experi­ ence.'\nPerhaps something of  the  nature  of  this  aspect of therapy  may  be conveyed  from  two  excerpts  from  the  case  of  Mrs.  Oak. iMrs.  Oak was  a  housewife  in  her  late  thirties,  who  was  having  difficulties  in marital  and family  relationships  when  she  came  in  for  therapy. Un­ like  many  clicnts,  she  had  a  keen  and  spontaneous  interest  in  the processes  which  she  felt  going  on  within  herself,  and  her  recorded interviews contain  much  material,  from  her  own frame of reference, as to  her perception  of what is occurring.  She  thus tends to  put  into words  what seems  to  be  implicit,  but  unverbalized,  in  many  clients. For  this  reason,  most  of  the  excerpts  in  this  chapter  will  be  taken from this one case.\nFrom an early portion of the  fifth interview comes material  which describes  the  awareness  of  experience  which  we  have  been  discus­ sing.\nClient: It all  comes pretty  vague. But you  know I  keep,  keep  hav­ ing the  thought occur to me that this whole process for me is kind of like  examining  pieces  of  a  jig-saw  puzzle. It  seems  to  me  I,  I'm in the process now of examining the individual pieces which really don't  have  too  much  meaning. Probably  handling  them,  not  even beginning to  think  of  a  pattern. That  keeps  coming  to  me. And it's  interesting  to  me  because  I,  I  really  don't  like  jig-saw  puzzles. They've  always  irritated  me. But  that's  my  feeling. And  I  mean I pick  up  little  pieces  (she  gestures  throughout  this  conversation to  illustrate  her  statements)  with  absolutely  no  meaning  except  I mean  the,  the  feeling  that  you  get  from  simply  handling  them without seeing them as  a pattern,  but  just  from  the  touch,  I  prob­ ably  feel,  well  it  is  going  to  fit  someplace  here.\nTherapist:  And  that  at  the  moment  that,  that's  the  process,  just getting  the  feel  and  the  shape  and  the  configuration  of  the  differ­ ent  pieces  with  a  little  bit  of  background  feeling  of,  yeah  they'll probably  fit  somewhere,  but  most  of  the  attention's  focused  right on,  ' W hat  does  this  feel  like? And what's  its  texture?'\n78\nT h e P rocess  of  B eco m in g   a P erson\nC:  That's  right. There's  almost  something  physical  in  it.

And  yet for the first time  in  months  I  am  not  thinking about my  problems. I'm  not  actually,  I'm  not  working  on  them. T:  I get the impression you don't sort of sit down to work on 'my problems.' It  isn't  that  feeling  at  all.\nC:  That's  right. That's  right. I  suppose  what  I,  I  mean  actually is  that  I'm  not  sitting down to  put this  puzzle  together as, as some­ thing,  I've got  to  see  the  picture. It,  it  m ay  be  that,  it  may  be  that I  am actually  enjoying this feeling process.  Or I'm  certainly learn­ ing something.\nT:  At  least  there's  a  sense  of  the  immediate  goal  of  getting  that feel  as  being  the  thing,  not  that  you're  doing  this  in  order  to  see a  picture,  but  that  it's  a,  a  satisfaction  of  really  getting  acquainted with  each  piece. Is  that -\nC:  That's  it. That's  it. And it still  becomes  that  sort  of sensuous­ ness,  that  touching. It's  quite  interesting. Sometimes  not  entirely pleasant,  I'm  sure,  but -\nT:  A  rather  different  sort of  experience.\nC:  Yes.  Quite.\nThis  excerpt  indicates  very  clearly  the  letting  of  material  come into  awareness,  without  any  attempt  to  own  it  as  part  of  the  self, or  to  relate  it  to  other  material  held  in  consciousness. It  is, to  put it  as  accurately  as  possible,  an  awareness  of  a  wide  range  of  experi­ ences,  with,  at  the  moment,  no  thought  of  their  relation  to  self. Later it may  be recognized that what was  being experienced  may all",

Thus  the  heading  of  this  section  has  been termed 'The Experiencing of the Potential Self.'\nThe  fact  that  this  is  a  new  and  unusual  form  of  experience  is  ex­ pressed  in  a  verbally  confused  but  emotionally  clear  portion  of  the sixth interview.\nC:  Uh,  I  caught  myself  thinking  that  during  these  sessions,  uh, I've  been  sort of singing a song.  N ow  that sounds vague and uh not  actually  singing - sort  of  a  song  without  any  music. Prob­ ably  a  kind  of poem  coming  out. And  I  like  the  idea,  I  mean  it's just sort of come to me without anything built out of, of anything. And in - following that,  it  came,  it  came  this  other  kind  of  feel­ ing. Well,  I  found  myself  sort  o f asking  myself,  is  that  the  shape that  cases  take? Is  it  possible  that  I  am just  verbalizing  and,  at times  kind  of  become  intoxicated  with  my  own  verbalizations? And  then  uh,  following this,  came,  well,  am  I  just  taking  up  your time? And then a  doubt,  a  doubt.  Then  something  else  occurred to me. Uh,  from  whence it  came,  I  don't  know,  no  actual  logical kind of sequence  to  the  thinking. The thought  struck  me:  W e're doing bits,  uh,  we're  not  overwhelmed  or  doubtful,  or  show  con­ cern  or,  or  any  great  interest  when,  when  blind  people  learn  to read with their fingers, Braille.  I  don't know - it may be  just sort of, it's all mixed up.  It may  be that's something that I'm experienc­ ing  now.\nT:  Let's  see  if  I  can  get  some  of  that,  that  sequence  of  feelings. First,  sort  of  as  though  you're,  and  I  gather  that  first  one  is  a fairly  positive  feeling,  as  though  maybe  you're  kind  of  creating  a poem  here - a  song  without  music  somehow  but  something  that might be quite creative, and then the, the  feeling of a lot of skepti­ cism about that. ' Maybe  I'm  just saying words,  just  being carried off by words that I, that I speak, and maybe it's all a  lot of baloney, really.' And  then  a  feeling  that  perhaps  you're  almost  learning a  new  type  of  experiencing  which  would  be  just  as  radically  new as for a blind person to  try to  make sense out of what he feels with his  fingertips.\nC:  M-hm.  M-hm. (Pause)  .  .  .  And  I  sometimes  think  to  myself, well,  maybe  we  could  go  into  this  particular  incident  or  that  par-\nticular  incident. And  then  somehow  when  I  come  here,  there  is, that  doesn't hold  true, it's,  it seems false. And  then  there  jus seems  to  be this  flow  of words  which somehow aren't  forced  an then  occasionally  this  doubt  creeps  in. Well,  it  sort  of  takes  form of a,  maybe  you're  just making music.  .  .  .  Perhaps  that's  why  I'm doubtful  today  of,  of  this  whole  thing,  because  it's something that's  not  forced. And really  I'm  feeling  that  what I  should  do  is, is  sort  of systematize the  thing. Oughta work harder and -\nT:  Sort  of  a  deep  questioning  as  to  what  am  I  doing  with  a  self that  isn't,  isn't  pushing  to  get  things  done,  solved? (Pause)\nC:  And  yet  the  fact  that  I,  I  really  like  this  other  kind  of  thing, this,  I  don't  know, call  it a  poignant  feeling,  I  mean - I  felt  things that I  never felt  before. I  like  that,  too. Maybe  that's  the  way  to do it. I  just don't know today.\nHere is the shift which seems almost invariably to occur in therapy which  has  any  depth. It  may  be  represented  schematically  as  the client's  feeling  that  ' I  came  here  to  solve  problems,  and  now  I  find myself  just  experiencing  myself.' And  as  with  this  client  this  shift is usually  accompanied  by  the  intellectual formulation  that  it is wrong,  and  by  an  emotional  appreciation  of  the  fact  that  it  ' feels good.'\nWe may conclude  this section  saying that  one  of the  fundamental directions  taken  by  the  process  of  therapy  is  the  free  experiencing of  the  actual  sensory  and  visceral  reactions  of  the  organism  without too  much  of  an  attempt  to  relate  these  experiences  to  the  self. This is  usually  accompanied  by  the  conviction  that  this  material  does  not belong to,  and  cannot  be  organized  into,  the  self. The  end  point  of this  process  is  that the  client  discovers  that  he  can  be  his  experience, with  all  o f  its  variety  and  surface  contradiction;  that  he  can  formu­ late himself  out  of  his  experience, instead  of  trying  to impose  a formulation  of  self  upon  his  experience,  denying  to  awareness  those elements which do not fit.\nT he  F u l l   E x pe r ie n c in g of  an  A ffectio n a l   R elatio n sh ip\nOne  of  the  elements  in  therapy  of  which  we  have  more  recently\nbecome  aware  is  the  extent  to  which  therapy  is  a  learning,  on  the\npart  of  the  client,  to  acccpt  fully  and  freely  and  without  fear  the positive feelings of another.  This is not a  phenomenon which clearly occurs  in  every  case. It  seems  particularly  true  of  our  longer  cases, but  does  not  occur  uniformly  in  these. Yet  it  is  such  a  deep  experi­ ence  that  we  have  begun  to  question  whether  it  is  not  a  highly  sig­ nificant  direction  in  the  therapeutic  process,  perhaps  occurring  at  an unverbalized  level  to  some  degree  in  all successful  cases. Before  dis­ cussing this  phenomenon,  let  us  give  it  some  body  by  citing  the  ex­ perience  of  Mrs.  Oak. The  experience  struck  her  rather  suddenly, between  the  twenty-ninth  and  thirtieth  interview,  and  she  spends most  of  the  latter  interview  discussing  it. She  opens  the  thirtieth hour in his way.\nC:  Well, I made  a  very  remarkable discovery. I know  it's (laughs)  I  found  out  that  you  actually  care  how  this  thing  goes. ( Both laugh) It  gave me the feeling, it's sort of well -  'maybe  I'll let  you  get  in  the  act,'  sort  of  thing. It's - again  you  sec,  on  an examination sheet, I would  have had  the correct answer,  I  mean but it  suddenly  dawned  on  me  that  in  the - clicnt-counselor kind of thing, you actually  care what  happens to this thing.  And it was a revelation, a - not that. That doesn't describe it. It was a - well,  the  closest  I  can  come  to  it  is  a  kind  of  relaxation,  a not  a  letting  down,  but  a -  (pause)  more  of  a  straightening  out without  tension  if  that  means  anything. I don't  know.\nT:  Sounds as  though  it  isn't  as  though  this  was  a  new  idea,  but  it was  a  new  experience  of  really  feeling  that  I  did  care  and  if  I  get the  rest  of  that,  sort  of  a  willingness  on  your  part  to  let  me  care. C:  Yes.\nThis  letting  the  counselor  and  his  warm  interest  into  her  life  was undoubtedly  one  of the  deepest  features  of  therapy  in  this  case. In an  interview  following  the  conclusion  of  therapy  she  spontaneously mentions this experience  as being the  outstanding one. What docs it mean?\nThe  phenomenon  is  most  ccrtainly  not  one  of  transference  and countcrtransfcrcnce. Some  experienced  psychologists  who  had  un­ dergone  psychoanalysis  had  the  opportunity  of  observing  the  de­\nvelopment  of  the  relationship  in  another  case  than  the  one  cited. They were the first to object to the use of the terms transference and countertransfercnce  to  describe  the  phenomena. The  gist  of  their remarks  was  that  this  is  something  which  is mutual  and  appropriate, where transference or countertransference are phenomena which are characteristically  one-way  and  inappropriate  to  the  realities  of  the situation.\nCertainly  one  reason  why  this  phenomena  is  occurring  more  fre­ quently  in  our  experience  is  that  as  therapists  we  have  become  less afraid  of  our  positive  (or  negative)  feelings  toward  the  client. As therapy goes on the  therapist's  feeling of  acceptance  and  respect  for the  client  tends  to  change  to  something  approaching  awe  as  he  sees the  valiant  and  deep  struggle  of  the  person  to  be  himself. There  is, I  think, within the therapist, a profound experience  of the underlying commonality - should  we  say  brotherhood - of  man. As  a  result he feels toward the clicnt a warm,  positive, affectional  reaction.  This poses  a  problem  for  the  client  who  often,  as  in  this  case,  finds  it difficult  to accept  the  positive  feeling of another. Yet  once  accepted the  inevitable  reaction  on  the  part  of  the  clicnt  is  to  relax,  to  let  the warmth  of  liking  by  another  person  reduce  the  tension  and  fear  in­ volved in facing life.\nBut  we  are  getting  ahead  of  our  client. Let  us  examine  some  of the  other  aspects  of  this  experience  as  it  occurred  to  her. In  earlier interviews she  had  talked  of the  fact  that she  did  not  love  humanity, and  that  in  some  vague  and  stubborn  way  she  felt  she  was  right, even  though  others  would  regard  her  as  wrong. She  mentions  this again  as  she  discusses  the  way  this  experience  has  clarified  her  atti­ tudes toward others.\nC:  The  next  thing tnnt occurred  to  me  that  I  found  myself think­ ing and still  thinking,  is somehow - and  I'm  not  clear  why - the same  kind  of a  caring  that  I  get  when  I  say  ' I  don't  love  human­ ity.' Which  has always sort of - I  mean  I  was always  convinced of it. So  I  mean,  it  doesn't -  I  knew that  it  was  a  good  thing,  see. And  I  think  I  clarified  it  within  m yself - what  it  has  to  do  with this  situation,  I  don't  know. But I  found  out,  no,  I  don't  love,  but I  do  care  terribly.\nT:  M-hm.  Al-hm. I  see.  .  .  .\nC:  .  .  .  It  might  be  expressed  better  in  saying  I  care  terribly  what happens. But  the  caring  is  a - takes  form - its  structure  is  in understanding and  not wanting to  be  taken  in,  or  to  contribute  to those  things which  I  feel  are  false  and - It  seems  to  me  that  in in  loving,  there's a  kind  of fijial factor. If  you  do  that,  you've  sort of  done  enough. It's  a -",

        "text": "C:  Yeah. It  seems  to  me  this  other  thing,  this  caring,  which  isn't a good term - I mean, probably  we need something  else to describe this kind of thing.  T o  say it's an  impersonal thing  doesn't mean  anything  because  it  isn't  impersonal. I  mean  I  feel  it's  very much a part  of  a whole.  But it's  something  that  somehow  doesn't stop.  . . . It  seems  to  me  you  could  have  this  feeling  of  loving humanity,  loving people,  and  at the  same  time - go  on  contribut­ ing  to  the  factors  that  make  people  neurotic,  make  them  ill where,  what  I  feel  is  a  resistance  to  those  things.\nT:  You  care  enough  to  want  to  understand  and  to  want  to  avoid contributing to  anything  that  would  make  for  more  neuroticism, or  more  of  that  aspect  in  human  life.\nC:  Yes. And it's - (pause).  Yes,  it's  something  along  those  lines. .  . .  Well,  again,  I  have  to  go  back  to  how  I  feel  about  this  other thing. It's - I'm  not  really  called  upon  to  give  of  myself  in  a sort  o f  on  the  auction  block. There's  nothing  final.  . . .   It  some­ times  bothered  me  when  I -  I  would  have  to  say  to  myself,  ' I don't love  humanity,' and yet, I  always knew that there was some­ thing  positive. That  I  was  probably  right. And - I  may  be  all off  the  beam  now,  but  it  seems  to  me  that,  that  is  somehow  tied up  in  the - this  feeling  that  I - I  have  now,  into  how  the  thera­ peutic value  can  carry  through. Now,  I  couldn't  tie it up, I couldn't  tie  it  in,  but  it's  as  close  as  I  can  come  to  explaining  to myself,  my - well,  shall I say  the  learning  process, the follow through on my realization that - yes, you do care in a given situa­ tion. It's  just  that  simple. And  I  hadn't  been  aware  of  it  before. I might  have  closed  this  door  and  walked  out,  and  in  discussing\n84\nT he  P rocess  of  B eco m in g   a  P erson\ntherapy, said,  yes,  the counselor must  feel thus  and  so, but,  I  mean, I  hadn't  had  the  dynamic  experience.\nIn  this  portion,  though  she  is  struggling  to  describe  her  own  feel­ ing,  it  would  seem  that  what  she  is  saying  would  be  characteristic of  the  therapist's  attitude  toward  the  client  as  well. His  attitude,  at its  best,  is  devoid  of  the  quid pro  quo  aspect  of  most  of  the  experi­ ences  we  call  love. It  is  the  simple  outgoing  human  feeling  of  one individual  for  another,  a  feeling,  it  seems  to  me  which  is  even  more basic  than  sexual  or  parental  feeling. It  is  a  caring  enough  about  the person  that  you  do  not  wish  to  interfere  with  his  development,  nor to  use  him  for  any  self-aggrandizing  goals  of your  own. Your satis­ faction comes in having set  him  free  to  grow  in  his own  fashion.\nOur client  goes  on  to  discuss  how  hard  it  has  been  for  her  in  the past to  accept any help or positive  feeling from  others, and  how  this attitude is changing.\nC:  I  have  a  feeling  .  .  .  that  you  have  to  do  it  pretty  much  your­ self,  but  that  somehow you  ought to be  able  to  do  that  with  other people. (She  mentions  that  there  have been ' countless' times when  she  might  have  accepted  personal  warmth  and  kindliness from  others.) I  get  the  feeling  that  I  just  was  afraid  I  would  be devastated. (She  returns to  talking about  the  counseling  itself and her  feeling  toward  it.) I mean  there's  been  this  tearing  through the thing myself.  Almost to - I  mean,  I  felt  it - I  mean  I  tried  to verbalize  it  on  occasion - a  kind  of - at  times  almost  not  want­ ing  you  to  restate,  not  wanting  you  to  reflect,  the  thing  is  mine. Course  all  right,  I  can  say  it's  resistance. But  that  doesn't  mean  a damn  thing  to  me  now.  .  .  .  The - I  think  in - in  relationship to this particular thing, I mean,  the - probably  at  times, the strongest  feeling  was,  it's  mine,  it's  mine. I've  got  to  cut  it  down myself.  See?\nT:  It's  an  experience  that's  awfully  hard  to  put  down  accurately into words, and  yet  I  get  a sense of difference  here in this  relation­ ship,  that  from  the  feeling  that  ' this  is  mine,'  ' I've  got  to  do  it,' ' I  am  doing it,'  and  so  on,  to  a  somewhat  different  feeling  that ' I  could  let  you  in.'\nC:  Yeah.  Now.  I  mean,  that's - that it's - well,  it's  sort of,  shall we  say,  volume  two. It's - it's  a - well,  sort  of,  well,  I'm  still  in the  thing  alone,  but  I'm  not - see -  I'm -\nT:  M-hm. Yes,  that  paradox  sort  of sums  it  up,  doesn't  it? C:  Yeah.\nT:  In  all  of  this,  there  is  a  feeling,  it's  still - every  aspect  of  my experience  is  mine  and  that's  kind  of inevitable  and  necessary  and so  on. And  yet  that  isn't  the  whole  picture  either. Somehow  it can  be  shared  or  another's  interest  can  come  in  and  in  some  ways it  is  new.\nC:  Yeah. And  it's - it's  as  though,  that's  how  it  should  be. I mean, that's how it - has to be.  There's a - there's a feeling, 'and this  is  good.' I mean,  it  expresses,  it  clarifies  it  for  me. There's a  feeling - in  this  caring,  as  though - you  were  sort  of  standing back - standing  off,  and  if  I  want  to  sort  of  cut  through  to  the thing,  it's  a -  a  slashing  of - oh,  tall  weeds,  that  I  can  do  it,  and you  can - I  mean  you're  not  going  to  be  disturbed  by  having  to walk  through  it,  too. I don't  know. And  it  doesn't  make  sense. I mean -\nT:  Except there's  a  very  real  sense  of  rightness  about  this  feeling that  you  have,  hm?\nC:  M-hm.\nMay  it  not  be  that  this  excerpt  portrays  the  heart  of  the  process of socialization? To  discover  that  it  is  not  devastating  to  accept  the positive  feeling  from  another, that it does  not  necessarily  end  in hurt,  that it actually ' feels good'  to have another person with you  in your struggles  to  meet  life - this  may  be  one  of  the  most  profound learnings  encountered  by  the  individual  whether  in  therapy  or  not.\nSomething of  the  newness,  the  non-verbal  level  of  this  experience is  described  by  Mrs.  Oak  in  the  closing  moments  of  this  thirtieth interview.\nC:  I'm  experiencing  a  new  type,  a - probably  the  only  worth­ while  kind  of  learning,  a - I  know  I've -  I've  often  said  what  I\nknow doesn't help me here.  W hat I meant is, my acquired knowl­ edge  doesn't  help  me. But  it seems  to  me  that  the  learning  process here  has  been -  so  dynamic,  I  mean,  so  much  a  part  of  the - of everything,  I mean, of me, that if I  just get that out of it, it's some­ thing, which,  I  mean - I'm  wondering  if I'll ever  be able to straighten  out  into  a  sort  of  acquired  knowledge  what  I  have  ex­ perienced  here.\nT:  In  other words,  the kind  o f learning  that  has  gone on  here  has been  something  of  quite  a  different  sort  and  quite  a  different depth;  very  vital,  very  real. And quite  worthwhile  to  you  in  and of itself,  but the question  you're  asking is:  W ill  I  ever  have  a  clear intellectual  picture  of  what  has  gone  on  at  this  somehow  deeper kind  of  learning level?\nC:  M-hm.  Something  like  that.\nThose who would  apply  to  therapy  the  so-called  laws of learning derived  from  the  memorization  of  nonsense  syllables  would  do  well to  study this excerpt with  care. Learning as it  takes place  in therapy is  a  total, organismic,  frequently  non-verbal  type  of  thing  which may or  may  not  follow  the  same  principles  as  the  intellectual  learn­ ing  of  trivial  material  which  has  little  relevance  to  the  self. This, however, is a digression.\nLet  us  conclude  this  section  by  rephrasing  its  essence. It  appears possible  that  one of the  characteristics  of deep  or  significant  therapy is  that  the  client  discovers  that  it  is  not  devastating  to  admit  fully into his own  experience  the  positive feeling  which another, the therapist,  holds  toward  him. Perhaps  one  of  the  reasons  why  this is  so difficult  is  that  essentially it involves  the  feeling  that  'I  am worthy of being liked.'  This we  shall consider in the  following sec­ tion. For  the  present  it  may  be pointed  out  that  this  aspect  of therapy  is  a  free  and  full  experiencing  of  an  affectional  relationship which  may  be  put  in  generalized  terms  as  follows: ' I can  permit someone  to  care  about  me,  and  can  fully  accept  that  caring  within myself. This  permits  me  to  recognize  that  I  care,  and  care  deeply, for and about others.'\nT he  L ikin g   o f  O n e 's S e l f\nIn  various  writings  and  researches  that  have  been  published  re­ garding  client-centered  therapy  there has been  a  stress  upon  the acceptance  of self as  one  of  the  directions  and  outcomes  of  therapy. We have established  the  fact that  in  successful  psychotherapy  nega­ tive  attitudes toward  the  self  decrease  and  positive attitudes  increase. We  have measured  the  gradual  increase  in  self-acceptance  and  have studied  the  correlated  increase  in  acceptance  of  others. But  as  I examine  these  statements  and  compare  them  with  our  more  recent cases,  I  feel  they  fall  short of  the  truth. The  client  not  only accepts himself - a  phrase  which  may  carry  the  connotation  of  a  grudging and  reluctant  acceptance  of  the  inevitable - he  actually  comes  to like himself. This  is  not  a bragging  or  self-assertive liking;  it  is rather a quiet pleasure in being one's self.\nAirs.  Oak  illustrates  this  trend  rather  nicely  in  her  thirty-third interview.  Is it significant that this follows  by  ten  days the  interview where she  could  for  the  first  time  admit  to  herself  that  the  therapist cared? Whatever  our  speculations  on  this  point,  this  fragment  in­ dicates  very  well  the  quiet  joy  in  being  one's  self,  together  with  the apologetic  attitude  which,  in  our  culture,  one  feels  it  is  necessary  to take  toward such an experience.  In the  last few minutes of the inter­ view, knowing her time is nearly up she says:\nC:  One  thing  worries  me - and  I'll  hurry  because  I  can  always go  back  to  it - a  feeling  that  occasionally  I  can't  turn  out. Feel­ ing  of  being  quite  pleased  with  myself. Again  the  Q  technique.* I  walked  out  of  here  one  time,  and  impulsively  I  threw  my  first card,  ' I  am  an  attractive  personality' ;  looked  at  it  sort  o f  aghast but  left  it  there,  I  mean,  because  honestly,  I  mean,  that  is  exactly how  it  felt - a - well,  that  bothered  me  and  I  catch  that  now.\n· This  portion  needs  explanation. As  part  of  a  research  study  by  another staff  member  this  client  had  been  asked  several  times  during  therapy  to  sort  a large  group  of  cards,  each  containing  a  self-descriptive  phrase,  in  such  a  way as to  portray her  own  self. At one end  of the  sorting she  was to  place  the card or  cards  most  like  herself,  and  at  the  other  end,  those  most  unlike herself. Thus  when  she  says  that  she  put  as  the  first  card, \"I am  an  attractive  person­ ality,'  it  means  that  she  regarded  this  as  the  item  most  characteristic  of  herself.\n88\nT h e P rocess  of  B eco m in g   a P erson\nEvery  once  in  a  while  a  sort  of  pleased  feeling,  nothing  superior, but  just - I  don't  know,  sort  of  pleased. A  neatly  turned  way. And  it  bothered  me. And  yet - I  wonder - I  rarely  remember things  I  say  here,  I  mean  I  wondered  why  it  was  that  I  was  con­ vinced,  and  something  about  what  I've  felt  about  being  hurt  that I  suspected  in - my  feelings  when  I  would  hear  someone  say  to a  child,  ' Don't  cry.' I mean,  I  always  felt,  but  it  isn't  right;  I mean,  if he's  hurt,  let  him  cry. Well,  then,  now  this  pleased  feel­ ing  that  I have. I've  recently  come  to  feel,  it's - there's  some­ thing  almost  the  same  there. It's - We  don't  object  when  chil­ dren  feel pleased  with  themselves. It's - I  mean,  there  really  isn't anything  vain. It's -  maybe  that's  how  people  shoidd  feel.\nT:  You've  been  inclined  almost  to  look  askance  at  yourself  for this  feeling,  and  yet  as  you  think  about  it  more,  maybe  it  comes close  to  the  two  sides  of  the  picture,  that  if  a  child  wants  to  cry, why shouldn't  he  cry? And if he wants to  feel  pleased  with  him­ self,  doesn't  he  have  a  perfect  right  to  feel  pleased  with  himself? And that sort of ties  in  with  this,  what  I  would  see as an  apprecia­ tion  of  yourself  that  you've  experienced  every  now  and  again.\nC:  Yes.  Yes.\nT:  ' I'm  really  a  pretty  rich  and  interesting  person.'\nC:  Something  like  that. And  then  I  say  to  myself,  ' Our  society pushes  us  around  and  we've  lost  it.' And  I  keep  going  back  to my  feelings  about  children. Well,  maybe  they're  richer  than  we are. Maybe we - it's something we've lost in the process of grow­ ing  up.\nT:  Could  be  that  they  have  a  wisdom  about  that  that  we've  lost. C:  That's  right. My  time's  up.\nHere  she  arrives,  as  do  so  many  other  clients,  at  the  tentative, slightly apologetic realization that she has come to like,  enjoy, appre­ ciate  herself. One  gets  the  feeling  of  a  spontaneous  relaxed  enjoy­ ment, a primitive joie de vivre, perhaps analogous to the lamb frisking about  the  meadow  or  the  porpoise  gracefully  leaping  in  and  out  of the waves.  Mrs. Oak feels that it is something native to the organism.",

In  the  ninth  interview  Mrs.  Oak  in  a  somewhat embarrassed fashion  reveals  something  she  has  always  kept  to  herself. That  she brought it  forth at some cost is indicated  by  the  fact that it was pre­ ceded  by  a  very  long  pause,  of  several  minutes  duration. Then  she spoke.\nC:  You  know  this  is  kind  of  goofy,  but  I've  never  told  anyone this  ( nervous laugh)  and  it'll  probably  do me good.  For years,  oh, probably from  early youth,  from  seventeen probably on,  I,  I  have had  what  I  have  come  to  call  to  myself,  told  myself  were  ' flashes of  sanity.' I've never told anyone  this, ( another  embarrassed laugh)  wherein, in, really I  feel sane. And, and pretty much aware of  life. And always with  a terrific kind  of concern  and  sadness  of how  far  away,  how  far  astray  that  we  have  actually  gone. It's just  a  feeling  once  in  a  while  of  finding  myself  a  whole  kind  of person  in  a  terribly  chaotic  kind  of  world.\nT:  It's  been  fleeting  and  it's  been  infrequent,  but  there  have  been times  when  it  seems  the  whole  you  is  functioning  and  feeling  in the  world,  a  very  chaotic  world  to  be  sure -\nC:  That's  right. And  I  mean,  and  knowing  actually  how  far  as­ tray we,  we've  gone  from,  from  being whole  healthy people. And of  course,  one  doesn't  talk  in  those  terms.\nT:  A  feeling  that  it  wouldn't  be  safe  to  talk  about  the  singing you* -\nC:  Where  docs  that  person  live?\nT:  Almost as  if  there  was  no  place  for  such  a  person  to,  to  exist.\nC:  Of  course,  you  know,  that,  that  makes  me - now  wait a  min­ ute - that  probably  explains  why  I'm  primarily  concerned  with feelings  here. That's  probably  it.\n· The  therapist's  reference  is  to  her  statement  in  a  previous  interview  that  in therapy she was singing a song.\n90\nT h e P rocess  of  B eco m in g   a  P erson\nT:  Because  that  whole  you  does  exist  with  all  your  feelings. Is that  it,  you're  more  aware  of  feelings?\nC:  That's  right. It's  not,  it  doesn't  reject  feelings  and -  that's  it.\nT:  That  whole  you  somehow  lives  feelings  instead  of  somehow pushing them to one side.\nC:  That's  right. {Pause) I suppose  from  the  practical  point  of view  it  could  be  said  that  what  I  ought  to  be  doing  is  solving some  problems,  day-to-day  problems. And  yet,  1,1 - what  I'm trying  to  do  is  solve,  solve  something  else  that's  a  great,  that  is  a great  deal  more  important  than  little  day-to-day problems.  Maybe that  sums  up  the  whole  thing.\nT:  I  wonder  if  this  will  distort  your  meaning,  that  from  a  hardheaded  point  of  view  you  ought  to  be  spending  time  thinking through specific problems.  But you wonder if perhaps maybe you aren't  on  a  quest  for  this  whole  you  and  perhaps  that's  more  im­ portant  than  a  solution  to  the  day-to-day problems.\nC:  I  think that's it. I  think that's  it. That's probably what I mean.\nIf  we  may  legitimately  put  together  these  two  experiences,  and  if we  are  justified  in  regarding  them  as  typical,  then  we  may  say  that both  in  therapy  and  in  some  fleeting  experiences  throughout  her previous  life, she has experienced a healthy satisfying enjoyable appreciation  of herself as a whole  and  functioning creature; and that this  experience  occurs  when  she does  not  reject  her  feelings  but lives them.\nHere  it  seems  to  me  is  an  important  and  often  overlooked  truth about the  therapeutic  process. It  works  in  the  direction  of  permit­ ting  the  person  to  experience  fully,  and  in  awareness,  all  of  his  re­ actions  including  his  feelings  and  emotions. As  this  occurs,  the  in­ dividual  feels  a  positive  liking  for  himself,  a  genuine  appreciation  of himself  as  a  total  functioning  unit,  which  is  one  of  the  important end  points  of  therapy.\nT h e\nD iscovery  that  th e  C ore  o f  P erso n a lity   is  P ositive\nOne of the most revolutionary  concepts to  grow  out of  our  clini­\ncal experience is  the  growing  recognition that  the  innermost  core  of man's  nature,  the  deepest  layers  of  his  personality,  the  base  of  his 'animal  nature,'  is  positive  in  nature -  is  basically  socialized,  for­ ward-moving, rational and realistic.\nThis  point  of  view  is  so  foreign  to  our  present  culture  that  I  do not  expect  it  to  be  accepted,  and  it  is  indeed  so  revolutionary  in  its implications  that  it  should  not  be  accepted  without  thorough-going inquiry. But  even  if  it  should  stand  these  tests,  it  will  be  difficult to accept.  Religion,  especially  the  Protestant  Christian  tradition,  has permeated  our  culture with  the  concept  that  man  is  basically  sinful, and  only  by  something  approaching  a  miracle  can  his  sinful  nature be  negated. In  psychology,  Freud  and  his  followers  have  presented convincing  arguments  that  the  id,  man's  basic  and  unconscious  na­ ture,  is  primarily  made  up  of  instincts  which  would,  if  permitted expression,  result  in  incest,  murder,  and  other  crimes. The  whole problem of therapy,  as  seen  by  this  group,  is  how  to  hold  these  un­ tamed  forces  in  check  in  a  wholesome  and  constructive  manner, rather than in the  costly  fashion of the  neurotic.  But the fact that at heart man is irrational,  unsocialized,  destructive  of others and  self this is a concept accepted  almost without question.  T o   be sure there are occasional voices of protest.  Maslow  ( 1)  puts up  a vigorous case for man's animal nature, pointing out that the anti-social emotions hostility,  jealousy,  etc. -  result  from  frustration  of  more  basic  im­ pulses  for  love  and  security  and  belonging,  which  are  in  themselves desirable. And  Montagu  (2)  likewise  develops  the  thesis  that  co­ operation,  rather  than  struggle,  is  the  basic  law  of  human  life. But these solitary voices are  little  heard. On the whole the  viewpoint  of the  professional  worker  as  well  as  the  layman  is  that  man  as  he  is, in  his  basic  nature,  had  best  be  kept  under  control  or  under  cover or both.\nAs  I  look  back  over my  years  o f clinical  experience  and  research, it  seems  to  me  that  I  have  been  very  slow  to  recognize  the  falseness of this  popular  and  professional  concept. The  reason,  I  believe,  lies in  the  fact  that  in  therapy  there are  continually  being  uncovered hostile  and  anti-social  feelings,  so  that  it  is  easy  to  assume  that  this indicates  the  deeper  and  therefore  the  basic  nature  o f  man. Only slowly  has  it  become  evident  that  these  untamed  and  unsocial  feel­\nings are  neither the  deepest nor  the  strongest, and  that the  inner core of  man's  personality  is  the  organism  itself,  which  is  essentially  both self-preserving and social.\nTo give more specific meaning to  this argument, let me turn  again to  the  case  of  Mrs.  Oak. Since  the  point  is  an  important  one,  I  shall quote at some length  from the  recorded  case  to  illustrate  the  type  of experience on which I  have  based  the  foregoing statements. Perhaps the  excerpts  can  illustrate  the  opening  up  of  layer  after  layer  of personality until we come to the deepest elements.\nIt  is  in the  eighth  interview  that  Mrs.  Oak  rolls  back  the  first lay*T  of  defense,  and  discovers  a  bitterness  and  desire  for  revenge underneath.\nC:  You  know  over  in  this  area  of,  of  sexual  disturbance,  I  have  a feeling  that  I'm  beginning  to  discover  that  it's  pretty  bad,  pretty bad. I'm  finding  out  that,  that  I'm  bitter,  really. Damn  bitter. I - and  I'm  not  turning  it  back  in,  into  myself  . . .   I  think  what  I probably  feel  is  a  certain  element  of  ' I've  been  cheated.' (Her voice is very  tight and her throat chokes up.)  And I've  covered up very  nicely,  to  the  point  of  consciously  not  caring. But  I'm,  I'm sort of  amazed  to  find  that  in  this  practice  of,  what  shall  I  call  it, a  kind  of  sublimation  that  right  under  it - again  words - there's a,  a  kind  of  passive  force  that's,  it's  pas -  it's  very  passive,  but  at the  same  time  it's  just  kind  of  murderous.\nT:  So  there's  the  feeling,  ' I've  really  been  cheated. I've  covered that up and seem  not to care and yet underneath that there's a kind of  a,  a  latent  but  very  much  present  bitterness  that  is  very,  very strong.'\nC:  It's  very strong.  1  - that I  know. It's  terribly  powerful.\nT:  Almost a  dominating kind  of  force.\nC;  O f  which  I  am  rarely  conscious. Almost  never  .  .  .  Well,  the only  way  I  can  describe  it,  it's  a  kind  of  murderous  thing,  but without  violence.  .  .  .  It's  more  like  a  feeling  of  wanting  to  get even.  .  . . And  of  course,  I  won't  pay  back,  but  I'd  like  to. I really  would  like  to.\nUp to this  point  the  usual  explanation  seems  to  fit  perfectly. Mrs. Oak  hns been able  to  look  beneath  the  socially  controlled  surface  of her  behavior,  and  finds  underneath  a  murderous  feeling  of  hatred and  a  desire  to  get  even. This  is  as  far  as  she  goes  in  exploring  this particular  feeling  until  considerably  later  in  therapy. She  picks  up the  theme  in  the  thirty-first  interview. She  has  had  a  hard  time getting  under  way,  feels  emotionally  blocked,  and  cannot  get  at the feeling which is welling up in her.\nC:  I  have the feeling it isn't guilt. (Pause.  She weeps.) Of course I  mean,  I  can't  verbalize  it  yet. ( Then  with  a  rush  of  emotion) It's  just  being  terribly  hurt!\nT:  M-hm. It  isn't  guilt  except  in  the  sense  of  being  very  much wounded  somehow.\nC:  ( W eeping)  It's - you  know,  often  I've  been  guilty  of  it my­ self  but  in  later  years  when  I've  heard  parents  say  to  their  chil­ dren,  ' stop crying,'  I've  had a  feeling,  a  hurt as  though,  well, why should  they  tell  them  to  stop  crying? They  feel  sorry  for  them­ selves,  and  who  can  feel  more  adequately  sorry  for  himself  than the  child. Well,  that  is  sort  o f what - I  mean,  as  though  I  mean, I  thought that they  should  let  him  cry. And - feel  sorry  for him too,  maybe. In  a  rather  objective  kind  of  way. Well,  that's that's  something  of  the  kind  of  thing  I've  been  experiencing. I mean,  now - just  right  now. And  in - in -\nT:  That catches  a  little  more  the  flavor  of  the  feeling  that  it's  al­ most  as  if  you're  really  weeping  for  yourself.\nC:  Yeah. And again  you  see  there's  conflict. Our  culture  is  such that - I  mean,  one  doesn't  indulge  in  self-pity. But  this  isn't - I mean,  I  feel  it  doesn't  quite  have  that  connotation. It  may  have.\nT:  Sort of think  that there  is a  cultural  objection  to  feeling sorry about  yourself. And  yet  you  feel  the  feeling  you're  experiencing isn't quite  what the culture  objected  to  either.\nC:  And  then  of  course,  I've  come  to - to  see  and  to  feel  that over  this - see.  I've  covered  it  up. (Weeps.) But I've  covered  it\nT h e  P rocess  o f  B eco m in g   a  P erson\nup  with  so  much  bitterness,  which  in  turn  I  had  to  covcr  up. ( Weeping)  Thai's what  I  want  to  get  rid  of! I  almost  don't  care if  I hurt.\nT:  (Softly, and with an  empathic  tenderness  toward  the  hurt she is  experiencing)  You  feel  that  here  at  the  basis  of  it  as  you  ex­ perience  it  is  a  feeling  of  real  tears  for  yourself. But  that  you can't show, mustn't show, so  that's been covered by bitterness that you don't like,  that you'd  like to be  rid  of. You almost feel  you'd rather absorb the hurt than to - than to feel the bitterness. (Pause)  And  what  you  seem  to  be  saying  quite  strongly  is,  I  do hurt, and  I've tried  to  cover it up.\nC:  I  didn't  know  it.\nT:  M-hm. Like  a  new  discovery really.\nC:  (Speaking at  the  same  time)  I  never  really  did  know. But  it's - you  know,  it's  almost  a  physical  thing. It's -  it's  sort  of  as though  I  were  looking  within  myself  at  all kinds  of - nerve endings and bits  of things  that  have  been sort of mashed. (Weep­ ing)\nT:  As  though some of the most delicate aspects of you  physically almost  have  been  crushed  or  hurt.\nC:  Yes. And  you  know,  I  do  get  the  feeling,  ' Oh,  you  poor thing.' (Pause)\nT :  Just  can't  help  but  feel  very  deeply  sorry  for  the  person  that is you.\nC:  I  don't  think  I  feel  sorry  for  the  whole  person;  it's  a  certain aspect  of  the  thing.\nT :  Sorry  to  see  that  hurt.\nC:  Yeah.\nT:  M-hm.  M-hm.\nC:  And  then  of  course  there's  this  damn  bitterness  that I  want  to get  rid  of. It's - it  gets  me  into  trouble. It's  becausc  it's a  tricky thing. It  tricks  me. (Pause)\nT:  Feel  as  though  that bitterness  is something you'd  like to  be  rid of because  it  doesn't  do  right  by  you.\nC:  ( C weeps.  Long pause)  I  don't know.  It seems to  me  that  I'm right  in  feeling,  what  in  the  world  good  would  it  do  to  term  this thing guilt.  T o   chase  dowr n things that would give me an interest­ ing case  history,  shall  we  say. What  good would  it  do? It  seems to  me  that  the - that the  key,  the  real  thing  is  in  this  feeling  that I have.\nT:  You could track down some tag or other and could make quite a  pursuit  of  that,  but  you  feci  as  though  the  core  of  the  whole thing  is  the  kind  o f  experience  that  you're  just  having  right  here.\nC:  That's  right. I  mean  if - I  don't  know  what'll  happen  to  the feeling. Maybe  nothing. I don't  know,  but  it  seems  to  me  that whatever understanding I'm to have is a part of this feeling of hurt, of - it  doesn't  matter  much  what  it's  called. (Pause)  Then  I one  can't  go - around  with  a  hurt  so  openly  exposed. I mean this  seems  to  me  that  somehow  the  next  process  has  to  be  a  kind of  healing.\nT:  Seems as though  you  couldn't  possibly  expose  yourself  if part of yourself is so  hurt,  so  you wonder if somehow  the  hurt mustn't be  healed  first. (Pause)\nC:  And  yet, you  know, it's - it's a funny  thing (pause). It sounds  like  a  statement  of  complete  confusion  or  the  old  saw that the  neurotic  doesn't  want  to  give  up  his  symptoms. But  that isn't  true. I  mean,  that  isn't  true  here,  but  it's - I  can  just  hope that  this  will  impart  what  I  feel. I somehow  don't  mind  being hurt. I  mean,  it's  just  occurred  to  me  that  I  don't  mind  terribly. It's  a -  I  mind  more  the - the  feeling  of  bitterness  which  is,  I know, the cause of this  frustration,  I mean the - I  somehow mind that  more.\nT:  Would  this  get  it? That,  though  you  don't  like  the  hurt,  yet you  feel  you  can  accept  that. That's  bearable. Somehow  it's  the things that  have  covered  up  that  hurt,  like  the  bitterness,  that you just - at this moment,  can't stand.\nC:  Yeah.  That's just about it.  It's sort of as though, well,  the first,\nT h e P rocess  of  B eco m in g   a  P erson\nI mean,  as  though,  it's - well,  it's  something  I can  cope  with. Now, the feeling of, well, I  can still  have a hell  of a  lot of fun, see. But that this other,  I  mean,  this  frustration - I  mean,  it comes out in  so  many  ways,  I'm  beginning  to  realize,  you  see. I  mean,  just this  sort  of,  this  kind  o f thing.\nT:  And  a  hurt  you  can  accept. It's  a  part  of  life  within  a  lot  of other  parts  of  life,  too. You  can  have  lots  of  fun. But  to  have  all of  your  life  diffused  by  frustration  and  bitterness,  that  you  don't like,  you  don't want,  and  are  now  more  aware  of.\nC:  Yeah. And  there's  somehow  no  dodging  it  now. You  see, I'm much  more  aware  of it. (Pause)  I  don't  know. Right now, I don't  know  just  what  the next step is. I really don't  know. (Pause)  Fortunately,  this  is  a  kind  of  development,  so  that  it doesn't carry over too acutely  into - I  mean,  I -  what I'm  trying to  say,  I  think,  is that I'm  still  functioning. I'm  still  enjoying my­ self  and -\nT:  Just  sort  o f  want  me  to  know  that  in  lots  of  ways  you  carry on  just  as  you  always  have.\nC:  That's it. (Pause)  Oh,  I  think  I've  got  to stop and  go.\nIn  this  lengthy  excerpt  we  get  a  clear  picture  of  the  fact  that  un­ derlying  the  bitterness  and  hatred  and  the  desire  to  get  back  at  the world  which  has  cheated  her,  is  a  much  less  anti-social  feeling,  a deep experience of having been  hurt.  And  it  is  equally  clear  that  at this  deeper  level  she  has  no  desire  to  put  her  murderous  feelings into action.  She  dislikes  them  and  would  like  to  be  rid  of them.\nThe  next  excerpt  comes  from  the  thirty-fourth  interview. It  is very  incoherent  material,  as  verbalizations  often  are  when  the  in­ dividual  is  trying  to  express  something  deeply  emotional. Here  she is  endeavoring to  reach  far  down  into  herself. She  states  that  it  will be difficult to formulate.\nC:  I  don't  know  whether  I'll  be  able  to  talk  about  it  yet  or  not. Might  give  it  a  try. Something - I  mean,  it's  a  feeling - that sort  of  an  urge  to  really  get  out. I know  it  isn't  going  to  make sense.  I  think that  maybe if I  can  get it out and  get it a  little,  well,\nin  a  little  more  matter  of  fact  way,  that  it'll  be  something  that's more  useful  to  me. And  1   don't  know  how  to - I  mean,  it  seems as  though  I  want  to  say,  I  want  to  talk  about my  self. And that is of  course  as  I  see,  what  I've  been  doing  for  all  these  hours. But, no, this - it's  my self. I've  quite  recently become  aware  of reject­ ing  certain  statements,  bccause  to  me  they  sounded - not  quite what I  meant,  I  mean,  a  little  bit  too  idealized. And  I  mean,  I  can remember  always  saying  it's  more  selfish  than  that,  more  selfish than  that. Until  I - it  sort  of  occurs  to  me,  it  dawns,  yeah,  that's exactly what I mean, but the selfishness I  mean, has an entirely dif­ ferent  connotation.  I've  been  using  a  word  ' selfish.' Then  I  have this  feeling  of - I - that  I've  never  expressed  it  before,  of  selfish - which  means  nothing. A - I'm  still  going  to  talk  about  it. A kind of pulsation.  And  it's  something aware all  the time.  And still it's  there. And  I'd  like  to  be  able  to  utilize  it,  too -  as  a  kind  of descending  into  this  thing. You  know,  it's  as  though - I  don't know, damn!  I'd sort of acquired someplace, and picked up a kind of  acquaintance  with  the  structure. Almost  as  though  I  knew  it brick  for  brick  kind  of  thing. It's  something  that's  an  awareness. I  mean, that - of a feeling of not being fooled, of not being drawn into  the  thing,  and  a  critical  sense  of  knowingness. But  in  a  way - the  reason,  it's  hidden  and - can't  be  a  part  of  everyday  life. And  there's  something  of - at  times  I  feel  almost  a  little  bit  ter­ rible  in  the  thing,  but  again  terrible  not  as  terrible. And  why? I think  I  know. And  it's - it  also  explains  a  lot  to  me. It's - it's something  that  is  totally  without  hate. I mean,  just  totally. Not with  love, but  totally 'without hate. But  it's - it's an exciting thing,  too  . . .   I  guess  maybe  I  am  the  kind  of  person  that  likes to, I mean,  probably  even  torment  myself,  or  to  chase  things down,  to  try  to  find  the  whole. And  I've  told  myself,  now  look, this  is  a  pretty  strong  kind  of  feeling  which  you  have. It  isn't constant. But  you  feel  it  sometimes,  and  as  you  let  yourself  feel it,  you  feel  it  yourself. You  know,  there  are  words  for  that  kind of  thing  that  one  could  find  in  abnormal  psychology. Might  al­ most be  like  the  feeling  that  is  occasionally,  is  attributed  to  things that  you  read  about. I mean,  there  are  some  elements  there - I mean,  this  pulsation,  this  excitement,  this  knowing. And  I've  said - I  tracked down one thing,  I  mean,  I  was  very,  very brave,  what\nshall  we  say - a  sublimated  sex  drive. And  I  thought,  well,  there I've  got it. I've  really  solved  the  thing. And that there  is  nothing more to it than  that. And  for  awhile,  I  mean,  I  was  quite  pleased with myself.  That was it.  And then I  had to admit, no, that wasn't it. 'Cause  that's  something  that  had  been  with  me  long  before  I became so  terribly  frustrated sexually. I  mean,  that  wasn't -  and, but in  the  thing,  then  I  began  to  see  a  little,  within  this  very  core is  an  acceptance  of  sexual  relationship,  I  mean,  the  only  kind  that 1  would  think  would  be  possible. It  was  in  this  thing. It's  not something that's been - I mean,  sex hasn't been sublimated or sub­ stituted  there. No. Within  this,  within  what  I  know  there - I mean, it's  a  different kind  of sexual feeling to  be  sure. I  mean,  it's one that  is  stripped  of all  the  things  that  have  happened  to  sex,  if you  know what  I  mean. There's  no  chase,  no  pursuit,  no  battle, no - well,  no  kind  of  hate,  which  I  think,  seems  to  me,  has  crept into such things.  And  yet, I  mean,  this feeling has been, oh, a little bit  disturbing.\nT:  I'd  like to see if I  can capture a little of what that means to you. It  is  as  you've  gotten  very  deeply  acquainted  with  yourself  on kind of a brick-by-brick  experiencing basis,  and in  that sense  have become more je/f-ish,  and  the  notion  of  really, - in  the  discover­ ing  of  what  is  the  core  of  you  as  separate  from  all  the  other  as­ pects,  you  come  across  the  realization,  which  is  a  very  deep  and pretty  thrilling  realization,  that  the  core  of  that  self  is  not  only without hate, but is really something more resembling a saint, some­ thing really very pure,  is the word I would use.  And that  you  can try  to depreciate  that. You  can  say,  maybe  it's  a  sublimation, maybe  it's  an  abnormal  manifestation,  screwball  and  so  on. But inside  of  yourself,  you  knew  that  it  isn't. This  contains  the  feel­ ings  which  could  contain  rich  sexual  expression,  but  it  sounds bigger than, and  really deeper than that.  And  yet  fully  able  to  in­ clude  all  that  could  be  a part  of  sex  expression.\nC:  It's  probably  something  like  that.  .  .  . It's  kind  of - I  mean, it's  a  kind  o f  descent. It's  a  going  down  where  you  might  almost think  it  should  be  going up,  but  no,  it's -  I'm  sure  of  it;  it's  kind of going down.\nT:  This  is  a  going  down  and  immersing  yourself  in  your self  al­ most.\nC: Yeah.  And  I - I  can't just throw it aside. I  mean,  it  just seems, oh,  it  just  is. I mean,  it  seems  an  awfully  important  thing  that  I just had to say.\nT:  I'd  like  to  pick  up  one  of  those  things  too,  to  see  if  I  under­ stand  it. That it sounds as  though  this sort of idea  you're  express­ ing is something you  must  be  going  up  to  capture,  something that isn't  quite. Actually  though,  the  feeling  is,  this  is  a  going  down to capture something that's more deeply there.\nC:  It  is. It  really - there's  something  to  that  which  is - I  mean, this - I have  a way,  and  of  course  sometime we're going  to have  to  go  into  that, of  rejecting  almost  violently,  that  which is  righteous,  rejection  of  the  ideal,  the - as - and  that  expressed it;  I  mean,  that's  sort  o f  what  I  mean. One  is  a  going  up  into  I don't know.  I  mean,  I  just have  a  feeling,  I  can't  follow. I  mean, it's  pretty thin  stuff if  you  ever  start  knocking  it  down. This  one went - I  wondered  why - I  mean,  has  this  awfully  definite  feel­ ing of descending.\nT: That  this  isn't  a  going  up  into  the  thin  ideal. This  is  a  going down into the astonishingly solid reality, that -\nC: Yeah.\nT : - is really more surprising than -",

But no, this is more inclusive, deeper than sex. One  would  expect  this  to  be  the  kind  of  thing  one  would  dis­ cover by going up into the thin realm of ideals. But actually, I  found it by going deep within myself. It seems to be something that is the essence, that lasts.\nIs  this  a  m ystic  experience  she  is  describing? It  would  seem  that the counselor felt so,  from  the  flavor of his  responses. Can we attach any  significance  to  such  a  Gertrude  Stein  kind  of  expression? The writer  would  simply  point  out  that  many  clients  have  come  to  a somewhat  similar  conclusion  about  themselves,  though  not  always expressed  in  such  an  emotional  way. Even  Mrs.  Oak,  in  the  follow­ ing interview,  the thirty-fifth,  gives  a  clearer and more  concise  state­ ment of her feeling, in a more  down-to-earth way.  She  also explains why it was a difficult experience to face.\nC:  I  think  I'm  awfully  glad  I  found  m yself  or  brought  myself  or wanted to talk  about self.  I  mean,  it's a very  personal, private kind of  thing that  you  just  don't  talk  about. I  mean,  I  can  understand my feeling of,  oh,  probably  slight  apprehension  now. It's - well, sort  of  as  though  I  was  just  rejecting,  I  mean,  all  of  the  things that western  civilization stands for, you  see. And  wondering whether  I  was  right,  I  mean,  whether  it  was  quite  the  right  path, and  still  of course,  feeling how  right  the  thing was,  you see. And so  there's  bound  to  be a  conflict. And  then this,  and  I  mean,  now I'm  feeling,  well,  of  course  that's  how  I  feel. I  mean  there's  a this  thing  that  I  term  a  kind  of  a  lack  of  hate,  I  mean,  is  very  real. It  carried  over  into  the  things  I  do,  I  believe  in.  .  .  . I think  it's all right. It's  sort  of  maybe  my  saying  to  myself,  well,  you've been  bashing  me  all  over  the  head,  I  mean,  sort  of  from  the  be­ ginning,  with  superstitions  and  taboos  and misinterpreted  doc­ trines  and  laws  and  your  science,  your  refrigerators,  your  atomic bombs. But  I'm  just  not  buying; you  see, I'm just, you just haven't  quite  succeeded. I think  what  I'm  saying  is  that,  well,  I mean,  just  not  conforming,  and  it's - well,  it's  just  that  way.\nT:  Your  feeling  at  the  present  time  is  that  you  have  been  very\nmuch aware  of all  the  cultural  pressures - not  always  very  much aware,  but  'there  have  been  so  many  of  those  in  my  life - and now  Tm  going down  more  deeply  into  myself  to  find  out  what  I really  feel'  and  it  seems  very  much  at  the  present  time  as  though that  somehow  separates  you  a  long  ways  from  your  culture,  and that's  a  little  frightening,  but  feels  basically  good. Is  that -\nC:  Yeah. Well,  I  have  the  feeling  now  that  it's  okay,  really.  .  .  . Then  there's  something  else - a  feeling  that's  starting  to  grow; well,  to  be  almost  formed,  as  I  say. This  kind  o f  conclusion,  that I'm  going  to  stop  looking  for  something  terribly  wrong. Now  I don't  know  why. But  I  mean,  just - it's  this  kind  o f  thing. I'm sort of saying to  myself  now,  well,  in  view  of what I  know,  what I've  found - I'm  pretty  sure  I've  ruled  out  fear,  and  I'm  positive I'm  not afraid  of shock - I  mean,  I  sort of would  have  welcomed it. But - in  view  of  the  places  I've  been,  what  I  learned  there, then  also  kind  of,  well,  taking  into  consideration  what  I don't know, sort of, maybe this is one  of the things that  I'll have to  date, and  say,  well,  now,  I've  just - I  just  can't  find  it. See? And  now without  any - without,  I  should  say,  any  sense  of  apology  or covering up,  just  sort of simple  statement that  I  can't  find  what at this time, appears to be bad.\nT: Does this catch  it? That as you've  gone more and more  deeply into yourself, and as you think about the kind of things that you've discovered and  learned and so on, the conviction grows very, very strong that no matter how far you go, the things that you're going to  find are  not dire  and  awful. They have a very  different charac­ ter.\nC:  Yes, something like that.\nHere,  even  as  she recognizes  that  her  feeling  goes  against  the grain  of her  culture,  she  feels  bound  to  say  that  the  core  of  herself is  not  bad,  nor  terribly  wrong,  but something  positive. Underneath the  layer  of  controlled  surface  behavior,  underneath  the  bitterness, underneath the hurt, is a self that is positive,  and  that is without  hate. This  I  believe  is  the  lesson  which  our  clients  have  been  facing  us with  for a long rime,  and  which we  have been slow to  learn.\nIf  hatelessness seems like  a rather neutral  or negative  concept,  per­\n102\nhaps  we  should  let  Mrs.  Oak  explain  its  meaning. In  her  thirtyninth  interview,  as  she  feels  her  therapy  drawing  to  a  close,  she  re­ turns to this topic.\nC:  I  wonder  if  I  ought  to  clarify -  it's  clear  to  me,  and  perhaps that's  all  that  matters  really,  here,  my  strong  feeling about  a  hatefree  kind  of  approach. Now  that we  have  brought  it  up  on  a ra­ tional  kind  of plane, I  know -  it sounds  negative. And yet in my thinking,  my - not  really  my  thinking  but  my  feeling,  it - and my thinking, yes, my thinking,  too -  it's a far more positive  thing than  this -  than  a  love - and  it  seems  to  me  a  far  easier  kind  of a - it's  less confining. But it - I  realize that it must sort of sound and almost seem like a complete rejection of so  many things, of so many creeds and maybe it is.  I don't know.  But it just to me seems more positive.\nT:  You can see how it might sound more negative to someone but as  far  as  the  meaning  that  it  has  for  you  is  concerned,  it  doesn't seem  as binding,  as possessive  I  take  it,  as  love. It  seems  as  though it  actually  is  more -  more  expandable,  more  usable,  than -\nC:  Yeah.\nT :  - any of these narrower terms.\nC:  Really  does  to  me. It's  easier. Well, anyway, it's easier for me to  feel  that  way. And I  don't  know. It  seems  to  me  to  really  be a  way  of - of  not -  of  finding  yourself  in  a  place  where  you aren't  forced  to  make  rewards  and  you  aren't  forced  to  punish. It  is - it  means  so  much. It  just  seems  to  me  to  make  for  a  kind of freedom.\nT:  Al-hm.  M-hm.  Where one is rid of the need of either reward­ ing or punishing,  then  it  just  seems  to  you  there  is  so  much  more freedom for all concerned.\nC:  That's right. (Pause)  I'm prepared  for some breakdowns along the way.\nT:  You don't expect it will be smooth sailing.\nC;  No.\nThis  section  is  the  story - greatly  abbreviated - of  one  client's discovery  that  the  deeper she  dug  within  herself,  the  less  she  had  to fear;  that  instead  of  finding  something  terribly  wrong  within  her­ self,  she  gradually  uncovered a  core  of self which  wanted  neither  to reward nor punish others, a self without hate, a self which was deeply socialized. Do  we  dare  to  generalize  from  this  type  of  experience that if we  cut through deeply  enough to  our organismic  nature,  that we find that man  is a  positive  and  social  animal? This  is  the sugges­ tion from our clinical experience.",

        "text": "The  thread  which  runs  through  much  of  the  foregoing  material of this chapter is that psychotherapy (at least client-centered therapy)  is  a  process  whereby  man  becomes  his  organism - with­ out self-deception,  without  distortion. What does this  mean?\nWe  are  talking  here  about  something  at  an  experiential  level a  phenomenon  which  is  not  easily  put  into  words,  and  which,  if apprehended  only  at  the  verbal  level,  is  by  that  very  fact,  already distorted. Perhaps  if we use several sorts of  descriptive  formulation, it may  ring some bell,  however  faint,  in  the  reader's  experience,  and cause him to feel ' Oh, now I  know,  from my own experience, some­ thing of what you are talking about.'\nTherapy  seems  to  mean  a  getting  back  to  basic  sensory  and  vis­ ceral experience.  Prior to  therapy the person  is prone  to  ask  himself, often  unwittingly,  'W hat  do  others  think  I  should  do  in  this  situa­ tion?' ' What  would  my  parents  or  my  culture  want  me  to  do?' 'What do I think  ought to be  done?'  He  is  thus  continually  acting in  terms  of  the  form  which  should  be  imposed  upon  his  behavior. This  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  he  always  acts  in  accord  with the  opinions of others. He may indeed endeavor to  act so  as to  con­ tradict the expectations of others. He  is  nevertheless  acting in  terms of the expectations  (often introjected expectations)  of others.  During the process of  therapy  the  individual comes  to  ask  himself,  in  regard to ever-widening areas of his life-space,  ' How do I experience  this?' 'What does  it mean to  vie}\" ' If  I  behave  in  a  certain  way  how  do I  symbolize  the  meaning  which  it  will  have  for  m e?' He  comes  to act on  a  basis of what may  be  termed  realism - a  realistic  balancing\nof  the  satisfactions  and  dissatisfactions  which  any  action  will  bring to himself.\nPerhaps  il will  assist  those  who,  like  myself,  tend  to  think  in  con­ crete and clinical  terms,  if  1   put some  of these  ideas  into  schematized formulations  of  the  process  through  which  various  clients  go. For one  client this  may  mean:  ' I  have  thought  I  must  feel  only  love  for my  parents,  but  I  find  that  I  experience  both  love  and  bitter  re­ sentment. Perhaps I  can be  that person  who  freely experiences  both love  and  resentment.' For  another  client  the  learning  may  be:  ' I have  thought I  was only bad  and  worthless. Now I  experience  my­ self  at  times  as  one  of  much  worth;  at  other  times  as  one  of  little worth  or  usefulness. Perhaps  I  can  be  a  person  who  experiences varying  degrees  of  worth.' For  another:  'I  have  held  the  concep­ tion that  no one could  really  love  me  for myself. Now I  experience the affectional warmth  of another for me.  Perhaps  I  can  be a person who  is  lovable  by  others - perhaps  I  am  such  a  person.' For  still another:  ' I  have  been  brought  up  to  feel  that  I  must  not  appreciate myself -  but I  do.  I can cry for myself, but 1  can enjoy myself, too. Perhaps I am a richly varied person whom  I can enjoy and  for whom I can  feel  sorry.' Or,  to  take  the  last  example  from  Mrs.  Oak,  'I have  thought  that  in  some  deep  way  I  was  bad,  that  the  most  basic elements in me must be  dire  and  awful. I  don't experience  that bad­ ness, but rather a positive desire to  live  and  let live. Perhaps I  can be that person who is, at heart, positive.'\nWhat  is  it  that  makes  possible  anything  but  the  first  sentence  of each  of  these  formulations? It is the  addition  of  awareness. In therapy  the  person  adds  to  ordinary  experience  the  full  and  undis­ torted  awareness  of  his  experiencing - of  his  sensory  and  visceral reactions. He ceases,  or  at  least  decreases,  the  distortions  of  experi­ ence in awareness.  He can be aware of what he is actually experienc­ ing,  not  simply  what  he  can  permit  himself  to  experience  after  a thorough  screening  through  a  conceptual  filter. In  this  sense  the person  becomes  for  the  first  time  the  full  potential  of  the  human organism,  with  the  enriching  element  of  awareness  freely  added  to the  basic  aspect  of sensory and  visceral  reaction. The  person  comes to  be  what  he  is,  as  clients  so  frequently  say  in  therapy. What  this seems  to  mean  is  that  the  individual  comes  to  be - in  awareness -\nt  lie  is - in  experience. He  is,  in  other  words,  a  complete  and fully functioning human organism.\nAlready I  can sense the reactions  of some of my  readers.  ' Do  you mean that as  a  result  of  therapy,  man  becomes  nothing but a  human organism,  a  human  animal? Who  will  control  him? Who  will  so­ cialize  him? Will  he  then  throw  over  all  inhibitions? Have  you merely  released  the  beast,  the  id,  in  man?' To  which  the  most ade­ quate  reply  seems  to  be,  ' In  therapy  the  individual  has  actually  be­ come  a  human  organism,  with  all  the  richness  which  that  implies. He is  realistically  able  to  control  himself,  and  he  is  incorrigibly  so­ cialized  in  his  desires. There  is  no  beast  in  man. There  is  only  man in  man,  and  this  we  have  been  able  to  release.'\nSo  the  basic  discovery  of  psychotherapy  seems  to  me,  if  our  ob­ servations  have  any  validity,  that  we  do  not  need  to  be  afraid  of being 'merely'  homo sapiens. It  is  the  discovery  that  if  we  can  add to  the  sensory  and  visceral  experiencing  which  is  characteristic  of the whole animal  kingdom,  the  gift of  a  free  and  undistorted  aware­ ness  of  which  only  the  human  animal  seems  fully  capable,  we  have an  organism  which  is  beautifully  and  constructively  realistic. We have  then  an  organism  which  is  as  aware  of the  demands  of the  cul­ ture  as  it  is  of its own  physiological  demands  for  food  or  sex which is just as aware of its desire  for  friendly  relationships as it  is  of its  desire  to  aggrandize  itself -  which  is  just  as  aware  of  its  delicate and sensitive tenderness toward others,  as it is of its  hostilities toward others.  When man's unique capacity of awareness is thus functioning freely and  fully,  we  find  that we  have,  not an  animal whom we must fear,  not  a  beast  who  must  be  controlled,  but  an  organism  able  to achieve,  through  the  remarkable  integrative  capacity  of  its  central nervous system,  a balanced, realistic, self-enhancing,  other-enhancing behavior  as  a  resultant  of all  these  elements  of  awareness. To  put it another  way,  when  man  is  less  than  fully  man -  when  he  denies  to awareness  various  aspects  of  his  experience - then  indeed  we  have all too  often  reason  to  fear  him  and  his  behavior, as  the present world situation  testifies. But when  he  is most  fully  man,  when  he  is his  complete  organism,  when  awareness  of  experience,  that  pecu­ liarly human  attribute,  is  most  fully  operating, then  he is to be trusted,  then  his  behavior  is  constructive. It  is  not  always  conven­\n106\nT he  P rocess  o f  B eco m in g a P erson\ntional. It  will  not  always  be  conforming. It  will  be  individualized. But it will also be socialized.",

I have revised it slightly.\nAs is customary  with  me,  I was  trying  to  keep  my  thinking  close to  the  grass  roots  of  actual  experience  in  therapeutic  interviews,  so I  drew  heavily  upon  recorded  interviews  as  the  source  of  the  gen­ eralizations which I make.\nI N  m y   w o r k at  the  Counseling  Center  of  the  University  of  Chi­ cago, I  have the opportunity of working with people  who present a wide  variety of personal problems.  There  is  the student concerned about failing in college;  the  housewife  disturbed  about  her marriage; the  individual  who  feels  he  is  teetering  on  the  edge  of  a  complete breakdown  or psychosis; the responsible professional man  who spends much of his time in sexual  fantasies and  functions inefficiently\n107\nin  his  work;  the  brilliant student,  at the  top  of  his  class,  who  is  para­ lyzed  by  the  conviction  that  he  is  hopelessly  and  helplessly  inade­ quate;  the  parent  who  is  distressed  by  his  child's  behavior;  the  pop­ ular  girl  who  finds  herself  unaccountably  overtaken  by  sharp  spells of  black  depression;  the  woman  who  fears  that  life  and  love  are passing her  by,  and  that  her  good  graduate  record  is  a  poor  recom­ pense;  the  man  who  has  become  convinced  that  powerful  or sinister forccs  are  plotting  against  him; -  I  could  go  on  and  on  with  the many different and unique problems which people bring to us.  They run  the  gamut  of  life's  experiences. Yet  there  is  no  satisfaction  in giving this  type  of  catalog,  for,  as  counselor,  I  know  that  the  prob­ lem as stated  in  the  first  interview  will  not  be  the  problem  as seen  in the second  or third  hour,  and  by the  tenth  interview  it will  be a  still different problem or series of problems.\nI have  however  come  to  believe  that  in  spite  of  this  bewildering horizontal  multiplicity,  and  the  layer  upon  layer  of  vertical  com­ plexity,  there  is  perhaps  only  one  problem. As  I follow  the  ex­ perience  of  many  clients  in  the  therapeutic  relationship  which  we endeavor  to  create  for  them,  it  seems  to  me  that  each  one  is  raising the  same  question. Below  the  level  of  the  problem  situation  about which the individual is complaining - behind the trouble with studies,  or  wife,  or  employer,  or  with  his  own  uncontrollable  or bizarre  behavior,  or  with  his  frightening  feelings,  lies  one  central search. It  seems  to  me  that  at  bottom  each  person  is  asking,  ' Who am  I,  really? How can I  get  in  touch  with  this  real  self,  underlying all  my surface behavior? How can I become myself?'",

        "text": "Let me try to  explain what  I  mean  when  I  say  that  it  appears  that the  goal  the  individual  most  wishes  to  achieve,  the  end  which  he knowingly  and  unknowingly  pursues,  is  to  becomc  himself.\nWhen a person  comes to  me,  troubled  by  his  unique  combination of  difficulties,  I  have  found  it  most  worth  while  to  try  to  create  a relationship  with  him  in  which  he  is  safe  and  free. It  is  my  purpose\nto understand the way he feels in his own inner world,  to accept  him as  he  is,  to  create  an  atmosphere  of  freedom  in  which  he  can  move in  his  thinking  and  feeling  and  being,  in  any  direction  he  desires. How does he use this freedom?\nIt  is my  experience  that  he uses  it  to  become  more  and  more  him­ self. He  begins  to  drop  the  false  fronts,  or  the  masks,  or  the  roles, with  which  he  has  faced  life. He  appears  to  be  trying  to  discover something more basic, something more truly  himself.  At  first he lays aside masks which  he is  to  some  degree  aware  of using. One  young woman student describes  in a  counseling interview  one  of the  masks she  has  been  using,  and  how  uncertain  she  is  whether  underneath this  appeasing,  ingratiating  front  there  is  any  real  self  with  convic­ tions.\nI was  thinking  about  this  business  of  standards. I somehow  de­ veloped a sort of knack,  I  guess,  of - well - habit - of trying to make  people  feel  at  ease  around  me,  or  to  make  things  go  along smoothly. There  always  had  to  be  some  appeaser  around,  being sorta  the oil that soothed  the waters.  A t a  small meeting,  or a little party,  or  something - I  could  help  things  go  along  nicely  and appear to be  having a  good  time. And  sometimes  I'd surprise  my­ self  by arguing against  what  I  really  thought  when  I  saw  that  the person  in  charge  would  be  quite  unhappy  about  it  if  I  didn't. In other  words  I  just wasn't  ever -  I  mean,  I  didn't find  myself ever being set  and  definite  about  things. Now the  reason  why  I  did  it probably was I'd been doing it around home so much.  I just didn't stand  up  for  my  own  convictions,  until  I  don't  know  whether  I have  any  convictions  to  stand  up  for. I  haven't  been  really  hon­ estly  being myself,  or  actually  knowing what  my  real  self  is,  and I've been just playing a sort of false role.\nYou  can,  in  this  excerpt,  see  her  examining  the  mask  she  has  been using,  recognizing her  dissatisfaction  with  it,  and  wondering  how  to get to the real self underneath,  if such a self exists.\nIn  this  attempt  to  discover  his  own  self,  the  client  typically  uses the relationship to explore, to  examine  the various  aspects  of his  own experience,  to  recognize and  face  up  to the deep  contradictions which  he  often  discovers. He  learns  how  much  of  his  behavior,\neven  how  much  of  the  feeling  he  experiences,  is  not  real,  is  not something  which  flows  from  the  genuine  reactions  of  his  organism, but  is  a  fagade,  a  front,  behind  which  he  has  been  hiding. He  dis­ covers  how  much  of  his  life  is  guided  by  what  he  thinks  he  should be,  not  by  what  he  is. Often  he  discovers  that  he  exists  only  in  re­ sponse to  the  demands  of  others,  that he  seems to  have no  self of  his own,  that he is only trying to think, and feel,  and  behave  in the  way that others believe he ought to think, and feel and behave.\nIn  this  connection  I  have  been  astonished  to  find  how  accurately the  Danish philosopher,  S0ren Kierkegaard,  pictured  the  dilemma of the  individual  more  than  a  century  ago, with  keen  psychological  in­ sight. He  points  out  that  the  most  common  despair  is  to  be  in despair at not choosing, or willing,  to be oneself; but that the deepest form  of  despair  is  to  choose  ' to  be  another  than  himself.' On  the other  hand  ' to  will  to  be  that  self  which  one  truly  is,  is  indeed  the opposite  of  despair,'  and  this  choice  is  the  deepest  responsibility  of man.  As  I  read  some  of his writings  I  almost  feel  that  he  must  have listened  in  on  the  statements  made  by  our clients  as  they  search  and explore  for the reality of self -  often a painful  and troubling search.\nThis  exploration  becomes  even  more  disturbing  when  they  find themselves  involved  in  removing  the  false  faces  which  they  had  not known  were  false  faces. They  begin  to  engage  in  the  frightening task  of  exploring the  turbulent  and  sometimes  violent  feelings  with­ in  themselves. To  remove  a  mask  which  you  had  thought  was  part of  your  real  self  can  be  a  deeply  disturbing  experience,  yet  when there  is  freedom  to  think  and  feel  and  be,  the  individual  moves  to­ ward  such  a  goal. A  few  statements  from  a  person  who  had  com­ pleted  a  series  of  psychotherapeutic  interviews,  will  illustrate  this. She  uses  many  metaphors  as  she  tells  how  she  struggled  to  get  to the  core  of herself.\nAs I  look at it now,  I  was peeling  off  layer after layer of defenses. I'd  build  them up,  try  them,  and  then  discard  them  when  you  re­ mained  the  same. I didn't  know  what  was  at  the  bottom  and  I was very much afraid to  find out, but I  had to keep  on trying.  At first  I  felt  there  was  nothing  within  me -  just  a  great  emptiness where I needed and wanted a solid core.  Then I  began to  feel thiit\nI  was  facing a  solid  brick  wall,  too  high  to  get over  and  too  thick to go through. One  day  the  wall  became  translucent, rather than  solid. After  this,  the  wall  seemed  to  disappear  but  beyond it I discovered  a  dam  holding  back  violent,  churning  waters. I felt  as  if  I  were  holding  back  the  force  of  these  waters  and  if  I opened  even  a  tiny  hole  I  and  all  about  me  would  be  destroyed  in the  ensuing  torrent  of  feelings  represented  by  the  water. Finally I  could stand  the  strain no  longer  and  I  let  go. All  I  did,  actually, was  to  succumb  to  complete  and  utter  self  pity,  then  hate,  then love. After  this  experience,  I  felt  as  if  I  had  leaped  a  brink  and was  safely  on  the  other  side,  though  still  tottering  a  bit  on  the edge.  I  don't know what I was searching for or where I was going, but  I  felt  then  as  I  have  always  felt  whenever  I  really  lived,  that I was moving forward.\nI  believe  this  represents  rather  well  the  feelings  of  many  an  in­ dividual  that  if  the  false  front,  the  wall,  the  dam,  is  not  maintained, then  everything  will  be  swept  away  in  the  violence  of  the  feelings that  he  discovers  pent-up  in  his  private  world. Yet  it  also  illustrates the compelling necessity which the individual feels  to search  for and become  himself. It also  begins  to  indicate  the  way  in  which  the individual  determines  the  reality  in  himself -  that  when  he  fully experiences the  feelings which  at  an  organic  level  he  is,  ns  this  client experienced her self-pity,  hatred, and  love,  then  he  feels an  assurance that  he  is  being  a  part  of  his  real  self.",

        "text": "I would  like  to  say  something  more  about  this  experiencing  of feeling. It  is  really  the  discovery  of  unknown  elements  of self. The phenomenon  I  am  trying  to  describe  is  something  which  I  think  is quite  difficult  to  get  across  in  any  meaningful  way. In  our  daily lives  there  are  a  thousand  and  one  reasons  for  not  letting  ourselves experience  our  attitudes  fully,  reasons  from  our  past  and  from  the present,  reasons  that  reside  within  the  social  situation. It  seems  too dangerous,  too  potentially  damaging,  to  experience  them  freely  and fully. But  in  the safety  and  freedom  of the  therapeutic  relationship, they  can  be  experienced  fully,  clear  to  the  limit  of  what  they  are. They can be  and  are  experienced  in  a  fashion  that  I  like  to  think  of\n112\nas a  ' pure  culture,'  so  that  for  the moment  the  person  is his  fear,  or he  is  his  anger,  or  he  is  his  tenderness,  or  whatever.\nPerhaps again I  can  clarify  this by  giving an example  from a client which will indicate and convey something of what I mean.  A  young man,  a  graduate  student  who  is  deep  in  therapy,  has  been  puzzling over  a  vague  feeling  which  he  senses in himself. He  gradually identifies  it  as  a  frightened  feeling  of  some  kind,  a  fear  of  failing,  a fear  of  not  getting  his  Ph.D. Then  comes  a  long  pause. From  this point  on  we  will  let  the  recorded  interview  speak  for  itself.\nClient: I  was kinda letting it seep through.  But I also tied it in with you  and  with  my  relationship  with  you. And  that's  one  thing  I feel  about  it  is  kind  of  a  fear  o f  it  going  away;  or  that's  another thing - it's  so  hard  to  get  hold  of - there's  kind  of  two  pulling feelings about it. Or two 'me's'  somehow.  One is  the  scared  one that  wants  to  hold  on  to  things,  and  that  one  I  guess  I  can  feel pretty clearly  right  now. You  know,  I  kinda  need  things  to  hold on to -  and I feel kinda scared.\nTherapist:  M-hm.  That's  something  you  can  feel  right  this  min­ ute,  and  have  been  feeling  and  perhaps  are  feeling  in  regard  to our relationship, too.\nC:  W on't  you  let me  have  this,  because,  you  know,  I  kinda  need it. I  can be so lonely and scared without it.\nT :  M-hm,  m-hm. Let  me  hang  on  to  this  because  I'd  be  terribly scared  if  I  didn't. Let  me  hold  on  to  it. (Pause)\nC: It's kinda the same thing - Won't you let me have my thesis or my  Ph.D-  so  then  .  .  .  'Cause  I  kinda  need  that  little  world. I mean___\nT :  In  both  instances  it's  kind  of  a pleading  thing  too,  isn't  it? Let me have this because I need  it badly.  I'd be awfully frightened without it. (Long pause.)\nC:  I  get  a  sense  of  . . .   I  can't  somehow  get  much  further  .  .  .  It's this  kind  of  pleading  little  boy,  somehow,  even  .  .  .  W hat's  this gesture  of  begging? (Putting  his  hands  together  as  if  in  prayer) Isn't it funny? 'Cause th at. . .\nT:  You put your hands in sort of a supplication.\nC:  Ya,  that's  right! Won't  you  do  this  for  me,  kinda  .  .  .  Oh, that's  terrible! Who,  me,  beg?\nPerhaps  this  excerpt  will  convey  a  bit  of  the  thing  I  have  been talking about,  the  experiencing  of  a  feeling  all  the  way  to  the  limit. Here  he  is,  for  a  moment,  experiencing  himself  as  nothing  but  a pleading  little  boy,  supplicating,  begging,  dependent. At  that  mo­ ment he is  nothing but  his  plcadingness,  all  the  way  through. To be sure  he  almost  immediately  backs  away  from  this  experiencing  by saying  'Wrho,  me,  beg?'  but  it  has  left  its mark. As  he  says a moment later,  ' It's such  a  wondrous  thing  to  have  these  new  things come  out  of  me. It  amazes  me  so  much  each  time,  and  then  again there's  that  same  feeling,  kind  of  feeling  scared  that  I've  so  much of  this  that  I'm  keeping  back  or  something.' He  realizes  that  this has  bubbled  through,  and  that  for the  moment  he  is  his  dependency, in  a  way  which  astonishes  him.\nIt  is  not  only  dependency  that  is  experienced  in  this  all-out  kind of  fashion. It  may  be  hurt,  or  sorrow,  or  jealousy,  or  destructive anger,  or  deep  desire,  or  confidence  and  pride,  or  sensitive  tender­ ness,  or outgoing love.  It may be any  of the  emotions of which  man is capable.\n\\Vrhat  I  have  gradually  learned  from  experiences  such  as  this,  is that  the  individual  in  such  a  moment,  is  coming  to  be  what  he  is. When a  person  has,  throughout  therapy,  experienced  in  this  fashion all the  emotions which  organismically  arise  in  him, and has ex­ perienced  them  in this knowing  and  open  manner,  then he has experienced  himself, in all the richness that exists within  himself. He has become what he is.",

        "text": "Let  us  pursue  a  bit  further  this  question  of  what  it  means  to  be­ come  one's  self. It  is  a  most  perplexing  question  and  again  I  will try to take from  a statement by  a client,  written  between  interviews, a suggestion  of  an  answer. She  tells  how  the  various  facades  by which  she  has  been  living  have  somehow  crumpled  and  collapscd,\nbringing  a  feeling  of  confusion,  but  also  a  feeling  of  relief. She continues:\nYou  know,  it  seems  as  if  all  the  energy  that  went  into  holding the  arbitrary  pattern  together  was  quite  unnecessary - a  waste. You think you  have to make the pattern yourself;  but there are so many pieces, and it's so hard to see where they fit.  Sometimes you put  them  in  the  wrong  place,  and  the  more  pieces  mis-fitted,  the more  effort  it  takes  to  hold  them  in  place,  until  at  last  you  are so  tired  that  even  that  awful  confusion  is  better  than  holding  on any longer.  Then you discover that left to themselves the  jumbled pieces  fall  quite  naturally  into  their  own  places,  and  a  living  pat­ tern  emerges  without  any  effort  at  all  on  your  part. Your  job  is just  to  discover  it,  and  in  the  course  o f  that,  you  will  find  your­ self and your own place.  You  must even let  your  own  experience tell you its own meaning; the minute you tell it what it means, you are at war with yourself.\nLet me  see if I  can  take  her  poetic  expression  and  translate  it  into the  meaning it  has  for  me. I  believe  she  is  saying  that  to  be  herself means  to  find  the  pattern,  the  underlying  order,  which  exists  in  the ceaselessly  changing  flow  of  her  experience. Rather  than  to  try  to hold her experience into the  form  of a mask, or to make it be a form or structure  that  it  is  not,  being  herself  means  to  discover  the  unity and  harmony  which  exists  in  her  own  actual  feelings  and  reactions. It  means  that  the  real  self  is  something  which  is  comfortably  dis­ covered  in  one's  experiences,  not  something imposed  upon  it.\nThrough  giving  excerpts  from  the  statements  of  these  clients,  I have been trying to  suggest what  happens  in the  warmth and  under­ standing  of  a  facilitating  relationship  with  a  therapist. It  seems  that gradually, painfully,  the individual explores what is  behind the masks he  presents  to  the  world,  and  even  behind  the  masks  with  which  he has  been  deceiving himself.  Deeply  and  often vividly  he  experiences the various  elements  of  himself  which  have  been hidden  within. Thus  to  an  increasing  degree  he  becomes  himself -  not  a  fagade  of conformity  to  others,  not a cynical  denial  of  all  feeling,  nor  a  front of  intellectual  rationality,  but a  living,  breathing,  feeling,  fluctuating process - in  short,  he  becomes  a  person.",

What  kind  of  person  lies  underneath?' Since  one  of  the  most  ob­ vious  facts  is  that  each  individual  tends  to  become  a  separate  and distinct and unique person, the answer is not easy.  However I  would like  to  point  out  some  of  the  characteristic  trends  which  I  see. No one  person  would  fully  exemplify  these  characteristics,  no  one  per­ son  fully  achives  the  description  I  will  give,  but  I do  see  certain generalizations which can be  drawn,  based  upon  living  a  therapeutic relationship  with  many  clients.",

        "text": "First  of all  I  would  say  that  in  this  process  the  individual  becomes more  open  to  his  experience. This  is  a  phrase  which  has  come  to have a  great  deal  of  meaning  to  me. It  is  the  opposite  o f  defensive­ ness. Psychological  research  has  shown  that  if  the  evidence  of  our senses  runs contrary  to  our  picture  of self,  then  that  evidence  is  dis­ torted. In  other words  we cannot  see  all  that  our  senses  report,  but only  the  things  which  fit  the  picture  we  have.\nNow  in  a  safe  relationship  of  the  sort  I  have  described,  this  de­ fensiveness  or  rigidity,  tends  to  be  replaced  by  an  increasing  open­ ness  to  experience. The  individual  becomes  more  openly  aware  of his own feelings and attitudes as  they exist in him  at an  organic  level, in the way I  tried to describe.  He also becomes more aware of reality as  it  exists  outside  of  himself,  instead  of  perceiving  it  in  precon­ ceived  categories. He  sees  that  not  all  trees  are  green,  not  all  men are  stem  fathers,  not  all  women  are  rejecting,  not  all  failure  experi­ ences prove that  he is no good, and  the  like. He is able  to  take  in  the evidence  in  a  new  situation,  as  it  isy   rather  than  distorting  it  to  fit a pattern which he already holds.  As you might expect, this  increas­ ing ability  to  be  open  to  experience  makes  him  far  more  realistic  in dealing  with  new  people,  new  situations,  new  problems. It  means that  his beliefs  are  not  rigid,  that  he  can  tolerate  ambiguity. He  can receive  much  conflicting  evidence  without  forcing  closure  upon  the\nsituation. This  openness  of awareness  to  what  exists  at  this moment in  oneself  and  in  the  situation  is,  I  believe,  an  important  element  in the  description  of  the  person  who  emerges  from  therapy.\nPerhaps  I  can  give  this  concept  a  more  vivid  meaning  if  I  illus­ trate  it  from  a  recorded  interview. A  young  professional  man  re­ ports  in  the  48th  interview  the  way  in  which  he  has  become  more open to some of his bodily sensations,  as well  as other feelings.\nC:  It  doesn't  seem  to  me  that  it  would  be  possible  for  anybody  to relate  all  the  changes  that  you  feel. But  I  certainly  have  felt  re­ cently  that  I  have  more  respect  for,  more  objectivity  toward  my physical makeup.  I  mean  I  don't expect too  much of myself.  This is  how  it works  out:  It  feels  to  me  that  in  the  past  I  used  to  fight a  certain  tiredness  that  I  felt  after supper. Well,  now I  feel  pretty sure  that  I  really am  tired -  that  I  am  not  making myself tired that  I am  just  physiologically  lower. It  seemed  that  I  was  just constantly  criticizing my  tiredness.\nT: So  you  can  let  yourself  be  tired,  instead  of  feeling  along  with it a kind of criticism of it.\nC:  Yes,  that  I  shouldn't  be  tired  or  something. And  it  seems  in  a way to  be  pretty  profound  that  I  can  just  not  fight  this  tiredness, and along with it goes a  real  feeling of I've  got to slow  down,  too, so  that  being  tired  isn't  such  an  awful  thing. I think  I  can  also kind  of pick  up  a  thread  here  of  why  I  should  be  that  way  in  the way  my  father  is  and  the  way  he  looks  at  some  of  these  things. For  instance,  say  that  I  was  sick,  and  I  would  report  this,  and  it would seem  that  overtly  he  would  want to  do something  about  it but  he  would  also  communicate,  'Oh,  my  gosh,  more  trouble.' You know, something like that.\nT:  As  though  there  were  something  quite  annoying  really  about being physically ill.\nC:  Yeah,  I'm  sure  that  my  father  has  the  same  disrespect  for  his own  physiology  that  I  have  had. Now last summer I  twisted  my back,  I  wrenched  it,  I  heard  it  snap  and  everything. There  was real  pain there all  the time at first,  real sharp.  And  I  had the  doctor look  at  it  and  he  said  it  wasn't  serious,  it  should  heal  by  itself  as\nlong  as I  didn't bend  too  much. Well  this  was  months  ago - and I have  been  noticing  recently  that - hell,  this  is  a  real  pain  and it's still there - and it's not my fault.",

In  a  way  I  guesss  you  could  say  that  I  am  just  more  accurately sensitive - or  objectively  sensitive  to  this  kind  of thing.  .  .  . And this  is  really  a  profound  change  as  I  say,  and  of  course  my  rela­ tionship  with  my  wife  and  the  two  children  is -  well,  you  just wouldn't  recognize it if you  could  see  me inside - as  you  have I  mean - there  just  doesn't  seem  to  be  anything  more  wonderful than really and genuinely - really  feelbig  love for your  own children  and  at  the  same  time  receiving  it. I don't  know  how  to put  this. We  have  such  an  increased  respect - both  of  us - for Judy  and  we've  noticed  just - as  we  participated  in  this - we have  noticed  such  a  tremendous  change  in  her - it  seems  to  be  a pretty deep kind of thing.\nT:  It  seems  to  me  you  are  saying  that  you  can  listen  more  ac­ curately  to  yourself. If  your  body  says  it's  tired,  you  listen  to  it and  believe  it,  instead  o f  criticizing  it;  if  it's  in  pain,  you  can  lis­ ten  to  that;  if  the  feeling  is  really  loving  your  wife  or  children, you  can  feel  that,  and  it  seems  to  show  up  in  the  differences  in them too.\nHere,  in  a  relatively  minor  but  symbolically  important  excerpt, can  be  seen  much  of  what  I  have  been  trying  to  say  about  openness to  experience. Formerly  he  could  not  freely  feel  pain  or  illness, becausc  being  ill  meant  being  unacceptable. Neither  could  he  feel tenderness  and  love  for  his  child,  because  such  feelings  meant  being weak,  and  he  had  to  maintain  his  facade  of  being  strong. But  now he  can  be  genuinely  open  to  the  experiences  of  his  organism - he can  be  tired  when  he  is  tired,  he  can  feel  pain  when  his  organism is in pain, he can  freely  experience  the  love  he  feels  for  his  daughter.\nand he can also feel  and  express annoyance toward  her,  as  he goes  on to  say  in  the  next  portion  of  the  interview. He  can  fully  live  the experiences  of  his  total  organism,  rather  than  shutting  them  out  of awareness.",

        "text": "A second  characteristic  of  the  persons  who  emerge  from  therapy is difficult  to  describe. It  seems  that  the  person increasingly  dis­ covers  that  his  own  organism  is  trustworthy,  that  it  is  a  suitable  in­ strument  for  discovering  the  most  satisfying  behavior  in  each  im­ mediate situation.\nIf  this  seems  strange,  let  me  try  to  state  it  more  fully. Perhaps  it will  help to understand my description if you think  of the  individual as faced with some existential choice:  ' Shall  I  go  home to my  family during vacation, or strike out on my own?'  'Shall  I  drink this  third cocktail  which  is being offered?' 'Is  this  the  person  whom  I  would like  to  have  as  m y  partner  in  love  and  in  life?' Thinking  of  such situations,  what  seems  to  be  true  of  the  person  who  emerges  from the  therapeutic  process? To  the  extent  that  this  person  is  open  to all  of  his  experience,  he  has  access  to  all  of  the  available  data  in  the situation,  on  which  to  base  his  behavior. He  has  knowledge  of  his own  feelings  and  impulses,  which  are  often  complex  and  contradic­ tory. He  is  freely  able  to  sense  the  social  demands,  from  the  rela­ tively  rigid  social  ' laws'  to  the  desires  of  friends  and  family. He has access to  his memories of similar situations,  and the  consequences of different behaviors in those situations. He has a relatively accurate perception  of  this  external  situation  in  all  of  its  complexity. He  is better  able  to  permit  his  total  organism,  his  conscious  thought  par­ ticipating,  to  consider,  weigh  and  balance  each  stimulus,  need,  and demand,  and  its  relative  weight  and  intensity. Out  of  this  complex weighing  and  balancing  he  is  able  to  discover  that  course  of  action which seems  to  come  closest  to  satisfying  all  his  needs  in  the  situa­ tion,  long-range  as  well  as  immediate  needs.\nIn  such  a  weighing  and  balancing  of  all  of  the  components  of  a given life choice,  his organism would not by any means be infallible. Mistaken  choices  might  be  made. But  because  he  tends  to  be  open to  his  experience,  there  is  a  greater  and  more  immediate  awareness\nof unsatisfying consequences,  a  quicker  correction  of  choices  which are  in  error.\nIt may help to realize that in most of us the  defects which interfere with this  weighing and  balancing  are  that  we  include  things  that are not a part of our experience,  and  exclude  elements  which  are. Thus an  individual  may  persist  in  the  concept  that  ' I  can  handle  liquor,' when  openness  to  his  past  experience  would  indicate  that  this  is scarcely  correct. Or  a  young  woman  may  see  only  the  good  quali­ ties of her prospective mate,  where  an openness  to  experience  would indicate  that  he  possesses  faults  as  well.\nIn  general  then,  it  appears  to  be  true  that  when  a  client  is  open to  his  experience,  he  comes  to  find  his  organism  more  trustworthy. He  feels  less  fear  of  the  emotional  reactions  which  he  has. There is  a  gradual  growth  of  trust  in,  and  even  affection  for  the  complex, rich,  varied  assortment of feelings  and  tendencies  which  exist in  liim at  the  organic  level. Consciousness,  instead  of  being  the  watchman over  a  dangerous  and  unpredictable  lot  of  impulses,  of  which  few can  be  permitted  to  see  the  light  of  day,  becomes  the  comfortable inhabitant of  a  society  of impulses  and  feelings  and  thoughts,  which are  discovered  to  be  very  satisfactorily  self-governing  when not fearfully  guarded.",

        "text": "Another trend  which  is evident  in  this  process  of becoming a per­ son relates to the source  or  locus  of choices and  decisions,  or evalua­ tive  judgments. The  individual  increasingly  comes  to  feel  that  this locus  of  evaluation  lies  within  himself. Less  and  less  does  he  look to  others  for  approval  or  disapproval;  for  standards  to  live  bv;  for decisions  and  choices. He  recognizes  that  it  rests  within  himself  to choose;  that  the  only  question  which  matters  is,  ' Am  I  living  in  a way  which  is  deeply  satisfying  to  me,  and  which  truly  expresses me?'  This  I  think  is  perhaps  the  most  important  question  for  the creative  individual.\nPerhaps  it will  help  if  I  give  an  illustration. I  would  like  to  give  a brief  portion of a recorded  interview  with  a young  woman,  a graduate  student,  who  had  come  for  counseling  help. She  was  ini­ tially very  much  disturbed  about  many  problems,  and had  been\ncontemplating  suicide. During the  interview  one  of  the  feelings  she discovered  was her  great desire  to  be  dependent,  just  to  let someone else take over the  direction  of  her life.  She was very critical  of those who had not given her enough  guidance.  She  talked about one after another  of  her  professors,  feeling  bitterly  that  none  of  them  had taught  her  anything  with  deep  meaning. Gradually  she  began  to realize  that  part  of  the  difficulty  was  the  fact  that  she  had  taken  no initiative  in  participating  in  these  classes. Then  comes  the  portion  I wish  to  quote.\nI think  you  will  find  that  this  excerpt  gives  you  some  indication of  what  it  means  in  experience  to  accept  the  locus  of  evaluation  as being  within  oneself. Here  then  is  the  quotation  from  one  of  the later  interviews  with  this  young  woman  as  she  has  begun  to  realize that  perhaps  she  is  partly  responsible  for  the  deficiencies  in  her  own education.\nC:  Well  now,  I  wonder  if  I've  been  going  around  doing  that, getting smatterings of things,  and  not getting hold,  not really get­ ting down to things.\nT:  Maybe  you've been getting just spoonfuls here and there rather than really digging in somewhere rather deeply.\nC: M-hm. That's  why  I  sa y (slon'ly  and  very  thoughtfully) well,  with  that  sort  of  a  foundation,  well,  it's  really  up  to  vie. I mean, it  seems to  be  really  apparent  to  me  that  I  can't  depend  on someone  else  to  give  me  an  education. ( Very  softly)  I'll  really have to get it myself.\nT:  It  really  begins  to  come  home -  there's  only  one  person  that can  educate  you - a  realization  that perhaps  nobody else  can  give you an education.\nC:  M-hm. (Long  pause - while  she  sits  thinking)  I  have  all  the symptoms of fright.  (Laughs softly)\nT:  Fright? That this  is a  scary  thing,  is that  what  you  mean?\nC:  M-hm. (Very  long  pause -  obviously  struggling  with  feel­ ings in herself).\nT:  Do  you  want  to  say  any  more  about  what  you  mean  by  that? That it really docs give you the symptoms of fright?\nC:  (Laughs) I, uh - 1 don't  know  whether  I quite know. I mean - well  it  really  seems  like  I'm cut  loose (pause), and  it seems  that  I'm  very - I  don't  know -  in  a  vulnerable  position, but  I,  uh,  I  brought  this  up  and  it,  uh,  somehow  it  almost  came out  without  my  saying  it. It  seems  to  be - it's  something  1   let out.\nT:  Hardly a part of you.\nC:  Well, I  felt surprised.\nT:  As  though,  ' Well  for  goodness  sake,  did  I  say  that?' (Both chuckle.)\nC:  Really,  I  don't  think  I've  had  that  feeling  before. I've - uh, well,  this  really  feels  like  I'm  saying  something  that,  uh,  is  a  part of me really. (Pause)  Or, uh,  (quite perplexed)  it  feels  like  I  sort of have,  uh,  I  don't  know. I have  a  feeling  of  strength,  and  yet,  I have a  feeling of -  realizing it's  so  sort  of fearful,  of fright.\nTV  That  is,  do  you  mean  that  saying  something  of  that sort  gives you at  the  same time  a  feeling  of,  of  strength  in  saying  it,  and  yet at  the  same  time  a  frightened  feeling  of  what  you  have  said,  is that it?\nC:  M-hm.  I  am  feeling that. For instance,  I'm  feeling it internally now - a sort of surging  up,  or  force  or  outlet. As if  that's  some­ thing  really  big  and  strong. And  yet,  uh,  well  at  first  it  was  al­ most a  physical  feeling  of  just being out alone,  and  sort of  cut  off from a - a support I  had been carrying around.\nT:  You  feel  that  it's something  deep  and  strong,  and  surging forth,  and  at  the  same  time,  you  just  feel  as  though  you'd  cut yourself loose from any support when you say it.\nC:  M-hm.  Maybe  that's - I  don't  know - it's  a  disturbance  of  a kind  of  pattern  I've  been  carrying  around,  I  think.\nT:  It  sort  of  shakes  a  rather  significant  pattern,  jars  it  loose.\nC:  M-hm. (Pause, then cautiously, but with conviction) I, I\nthink - I  don't know,  but I  have  the  feeling that then  I  am  going to begin to  do more things  that I  know  I  should  do.  .  .  . There are so  many things  that  I  need  to  do. It seems  in  so  many  avenues  of my living I  have to work out new ways of behavior, but - maybe - I can see myself doing a little better in some things\nI  hope  that  this  illustration  gives some  sense  of  the strength  which is  experienced  in  being  a  unique  person,  responsible  for  oneself,  and also the uneasiness that accompanies this assumption of responsibility. To  recognize  that  ' I  am  the  one  who  chooses'  and  ' I  am  the  one who  determines  the  value  of  an  experience  for  me'  is  both  an  in­ vigorating  and  a  frightening  realization.",

It  is  that  the individual seems to  become more  content to  be a process rather  than a  product. When  he  enters  the  therapeutic  relationship,  the  client is  likely  to  wish  to  achieve  some  fixed  state:  he  wants  to  reach  the point where  his  problems  are  solved,  or  where  he  is  effective  in  his work,  or  where  his  marriage  is  satisfactory. He  tends,  in  the  free­ dom of the  therapeutic  relationship  to  drop  such  fixed  goals,  and  to accept a  more  satisfying  realization  that  he  is  not  a  fixed  entity,  but a  process of becoming.\nOne  client,  at  the  conclusion  of  therapy,  says  in  rather  puzzled fashion,  ' I  haven't  finished  the  job  of  integrating  and  reorganizing myself,  but  that's  only  confusing,  not  discouraging,  now  that  I  real­ ize  this  is  a  continuing process..  .  .  It's exciting,  sometimes  upsetting, but deeply encouraging  to feel yourself in  action,  apparently  know­ ing where  you  are  going  even  though  you  don't  always  consciously know where  that is.' One  can  see  here  both  the  expression  of trust in  the  organism,  whic h  I  have  mentioned,  and  also  the  realization  of self as a  process. Here is a  personal  description  of what  it seems  like to  accept  oneself  as  a  stream  of  becoming,  not  a  finished  product. It  means that a person is a  fluid process,  not  a  fixed  and  static  entity; a  flowing river of change, not a block of solid material; a continually changing constellation  of potentialities,  not a fixed  quantity  of  traits\nHere  is  another statement  of  this  same  element of  fluidity  or  exis­ tential  living,  ' This  whole  train  of  experiencing,  and  the  meanings that I  have  thus  far  discovered  in  it,  seem  to  have  launched  me  on  a process  which  is  both  fascinating  and  at  times  a  little  frightening. It  seems  to  mean  letting  my  experiences  carry  me  on,  in  a  direction which  appears  to  be  forward,  towards  goals  that  I  can  but  dimly define,  as  I  try  to  understand  at  least  the  current  meaning  of  that experience. The sensation  is  that  of  floating  with  a  complex  stream of experience,  with  the  fascinating  possibility  of  trying  to  compre­ hend  its  ever-changing  complexity.'",

I have  endeavored to  describe,  as  accurately  as  I  can,  the  meanings  which  seem  to  be involved  in  this  process  of  becoming  a  person. I  am  sure  that  this process  is  not  one  that  occurs  only  in  therapy. I am  sure  that  I  do not see  it  clearly  or  completely,  since  I  keep  changing  my  compre­ hension and  understanding of it. I  hope  you  will  accept  it  as  a  cur­ rent  and  tentative  picture,  not  as  something  final.\nOne  reason  for  stressing  the  tentative  nature  of  what  I  have  said is that I wish  to make it clear that I am not saying,  'This is what you should  become;  here  is  the  goal  for  you.' Rather,  I  am  saying  that these  are  some  of  the  meanings  I  see  in  the  experiences  that  my clients  and  I  have  shared. Perhaps  this  picture  of  the  experience  of others  may  illuminate  or  give  more  meaning  to  some  of  your  own experience.\nI have  pointed  out  that  each  individual  appears  to  be  asking  a double question:  'W ho am I?' and ' H ow may I become myself?'  I have  stated  that  in  a  favorable  psychological  climate  a  process  of becoming  takes  place;  that  here  the  individual  drops  one  after  an­ other  of  the  defensive  masks  with  which  he  has  faced  life;  that  he experiences  fully  the  hidden  aspects  of  himself;  that  he  discovers  in these  experiences  the  stranger  who  has  been  living  behind these\nmasks,  the  stranger  who  is  himself. I have  tried  to  give  my  picture of the  characteristic  attributes  of  the  person  who  emerges;  a  person who is more open  to  all  of  the  elements  of  his  organic  experience;  a person  who  is  developing  a  trust  in  his  own  organism  as  an  instru­ ment of sensitive  living; a  person who accepts the locus of evaluation as  residing within  himself;  a  person  who  is  learning to  live  in  his  life as a participant in  a  fluid,  ongoing process,  in which  he  is continually discovering  new  aspects  of  himself  in  the flow  of  his  experience. These are  some  of  the  elements  which  seem  to  me  to  be  involved  in becoming  a  person.\n7",

There was how­ ever a penalty  attached to  the  award, which  was that  one  year  later, each recipient  was  to  present  a  paper to  the  Association. It  did  not appeal  to  me  to  review  work  which  we  had  done  in  the  past. I  de­ cided  rather to  devote  the  year  to  a  fresh  attempt  to  understand  the process  by  which  personality  changes. I did  thisy but  as  the  next autumn approached, / realized that  the  ideas I  had  formed were  still unclear,  tentative,  hardly  in  shape  for  presentation. Nevertheless  I tried  to  set  down  the  jumbled  sensings  which  had  been  important to  mej  out  of  which  was  emerging  a  concept  of  process  different from anything I  had  clearly  perceived  before. When I  had  finished I found I  had a  paper much  too  long  to  deliver,  so  I  cut  it  down  to an  abbreviated  form  for  presentation  on  September  2,  1951  to  the American  Psychological  Convention  in  New  York. The  present chapter  is  neither  as  long  as  the  initial  form y   nor  as  abbreviated  as the second form.\nIt will  be discovered  that though  the  two  preceding  chapters view the process of therapy almost entirely  from a phenomenological point  of  view,  from  within  the  client's  frame  of  reference,  this  for-\n125\nvmlation  endeavors  to  capture  those  qualities  of  expression  'which may  be  observed  by  anothery   and  hence  views  it  more  from  an  ex­ ternal frame of reference.\nOut of the  observations recorded  in  this paper a 'Scale  of Process in  Psychotherapy'  has  been  developed which  can  be  applied  opera­ tionally  to  excerpts from  recorded interviews.  It is still in process of revision and improvement.  Even in its present form it has reasonable inter-judge reliability, and gives meaningful results. Cases  which  by other criteria  are  known  to  be more  successful show  greater movevient  on  the  Process  Scale  than  less  successful  cases. Also,  to  our surprise  it  has  been  found  that  successful  cases begin at  a higher level  on  the  Process Scale  than  do  unsuccessful  cases. Evidently  we do not yet  know, with  any  satisfactory  degree  of assurance,  how  to be of therapeutic help to individuals whose behavior when they  come to  us  is  typical  of  stages  one  and  two  as  described  in  this  chapter. Thus  the  ideas of  this paper,  poorly  formed and incomplete  as  they seemed  to  me  at  the  time,  are  already  opening  up  new  and  chal­ lenging areas for thought and investigation.\n%",

The  object  of  the  trip,  the  goal  o f  the  search,  is  to  try  to  learn something of the process o f   p sy c h o th erapy,  or  the process by which personality  change  takes  place. I  w ould  warn  you  that  the  goal  has not  yet  been  achieved,  and  that  it  seems  as  though  the  expedition has  advanced  only  a  few   short  miles  into  the  jungle. Yet  perhaps  if I  can  take  you  w ith   me,  you  w ill  be  tem pted  to  discover  new   and profitable avenues of further advance.\nMy own reason for engaging in  such a search seems  simple  to  me. Just  as  m any  psychologists  have  been  interested  in  the  invariant  as­ pects  o f  personality -  the  unchanging  aspects  of  intelligence,  tem ­ perament,  personality  structure -  so  I  have  long  been  interested  in\nthe  invariant  aspects  of  change  in  personality. Do  personality  and behavior change?  What commonalities exist in such changes?  What commonalities  exist  in  the  conditions  which  precede  change? Most important of all, what is the process by which such change occurs?\nUntil  recently we  have  for  the most part  tried  to  learn  something of  this  process  by  studying  outcomes. We  have  many  facts,  for example,  regarding the  changes  which  take  place  in  self-perception, or in perception  of others. We  have  not  only  measured  these changes  over  the  whole  course  of  therapy,  but  at  intervals  during therapy. Yet  even  this  last  gives  us  little  clue  as  to  the  process  in­ volved. Studies  of  segmented  outcomes  are  still  measures  of  out­ come, giving little knowledge  of  the  w ay in which  the  change takes place.\nPuzzling  over  this  problem  of  getting  at  the  process  has  led  me to  realize  how  little  objective  research deals  with  process  in  any field. Objective  research  slices  through  the  frozen  moment  to  pro­ vide  us  with  an  exact  picture  of  the  inter-relationships  which  exist at that moment.  But our understanding of the ongoing movement whether it be  the  process  of  fermentation,  or  the  circulation  of  the blood,  or  the  process  of  atomic  fission -  is  generally  provided  by  a theoretical  formulation,  often  supplemented,  where  feasible,  with  a clinical  observation  of  the  process. I  have  thus  come  to  realize  that perhaps I am hoping for too much to expect that research procedures can shed  light directly upon  the  process  of personality change. Per­ haps only theory can do that.",

There was much  that was  appealing  in  the  field  of  communication  theory, with  its concepts  of feedback,  input  and  output signals,  and  the  like. There  was  the  possibility  of  describing  the  process  of  therapy  in terms of  learning  theory,  or in  terms  of  general  systems  theory. As I  studied  these  avenues  of  understanding  I  became  convinced  that it  would  be  possible  to  translate  the  process  of  psychotherapy  into\nany  one  of  these  theoretical  frameworks. It  would,  I  believe,  have certain  advantages  to  do  so. But  I  also  became  convinced  that  in  a field so new, this is not what is most needed.\nI  came  to  a  conclusion  which  others  have  reached  before,  that  in a  new  field  perhaps  what  is  needed  first  is  to  steep  oneself  in  the events,  to  approach  the  phenomena  with  as  few  preconceptions  as possible,  to  take  a  naturalist's  observational,  descriptive  approach  to these  events,  and  to  draw  forth  those  low-level  inferences  which seem most native to the material itself.",

I used myself as a tool.\nAs  a  tool,  I  have  qualities  both  good  and  bad. For  many  years  I have  experienced  therapy  as  a  therapist. I have  experienced  it  on the  other  side of the  desk  as  a  client. I  have  thought  about  therapy, carried on research in  this  field, been  intimately  acquainted  with the research of others.  But I  have also  formed biases,  have come  to  have a  particular  slant  on  therapy,  have  tried  to  develop  theoretical  ab­ stractions  regarding  therapy. These  views  and  theories  would  tend to make me less sensitive to the events themselves.  Could I  open my­ self  to  the  phenomena  of  therapy  freshly,  naively? Could  I  let  the totality of m y experience be  as effective a tool  as  it might  potentially be,  or  would  my  biases  prevent  me  from  seeing  what  was  there? I could only go ahead and make the attempt.\nSo,  during this  past  year  I  have  spent  many  hours  listening  to  re­ corded  therapeutic  interviews -  trying  to  listen  as  naively  as  pos­ sible. I  have  endeavored  to  soak  up  all  the  clues  I  could  capture  as to  the  process,  as  to  what  elements  are  significant  in  change. Then I have  tried  to  abstract  from  that  sensing  the  simplest  abstractions which would  describe  them.  Here I  have  been  much stimulated and helped  by the  thinking  of  many  of my  colleagues,  but  I  would  like to  mention  my  special  indebtedness  to  Eugene  Gendlin,  William Kirtner  and  Fred  Zimring,  whose  demonstrated  ability  to  think  in\nnew  ways  about  these  matters  has  been  particularly  helpful,  and from whom I have borrowed heavily.\nThe  next  step  has  been  to  take  these  observations  and  low-level abstractions and  formulate them  in such  a way that testable  hypothe­ ses can readily be  drawn  from them.  This is the point I  have reached. I  make  no  apology  for  the  fact  that  I  am  reporting  no  empirical  in­ vestigations  of  these  formulations. If  past  experience  is  any  guide, then  I  may  rest  assured  that,  if  the  formulations  I  am  about  to  pre­ sent  check  in  anv  way with  the  subjective  experience of other therapists,  then  a  great  deal  of  research  will  be  stimulated,  and  in  a few  years  there  will  be  ample  evidence  of  the  degree  of  truth  and falsity in the statements which follow.",

        "text": "It may seem strange to  you that  I  tell  you so much of  the personal process  I  went  through  in  seeking for some  simple - and  I  am  sure, inadequate - fonnulations. It  is  because I feel that  nine-tenths  of research  is  always  submerged,  and that  only  the  iciest  portion  is ever seen,  a  very  misleading segment. Only occasionally  does  some­ one  like  Mooney  (6,  7)  describe  the  whole  of  the  research  method as it  exists  in  the  individual. I  too  should  like  to  reveal  something of the  whole  of  this  study  as  it  went  on  in  me,  not  simply  the  imper­ sonal portion.\nIndeed I wish I  might share with you much more  fully some of the excitement and  discouragement  of this  effort  to  understand  process. I  would  like  to  tell  you  of  my  fresh  discovery  of  the  way  feelings ' hit' clients -  a  word  they  frequently  use. The  client  is  talking about something  of  importance,  when  wham!  he  is  hit  by  a  feeling - not  something  named  or  labelled  but  an  experiencing  of  an  un­ known something which has  to  be  cautiously explored  before  it  can be  named  at  all. As  one  client  says,  ' It's  a  feeling  that  I'm  caught with. I  can't  even  know  what  it  connects  with.' The  frequency  of this event was striking to me.\nAnother  matter  of  interest  was  the  variety  of  ways  in which clients do come closer to their feelings. Feelings ' bubble up through,'  they  'seep  through.' The  client  also  lets  himself  ' down\ninto'  his  feeling,  often  with  caution  and  fear. ' I  want  to  get  down into this feeling.  You  can kinda see  how  hard  it is  to  get  really  close to it.'\nStill  another  of  these  naturalistic  observations  has  to  do  with  the importance which the client comes to  attach to  exactness of symbol­ ization. He wants just the precise word which for him  describes  the feeling he  has  experienced.  An approximation will  not  do. And this is  certainly  for  clearer communication  within  himself,  since  any  one of  several  words  would  convey  the  meaning  equally  well  to  an­ other.\nI  came  also  to  appreciate  what  I  think  of  as  'moments  of  move­ ment' - moments  when  it  appears  that change  actually occurs. These  moments,  with  their  rather  obvious  physiological  concomi­ tants, I will try to describe later.\nI  would also  like to  mention the  profound sense  of despair I  some­ times  felt,  wandering  naively  in  the  incredible  complexity  of  the therapeutic  relationship. Small  wonder  that  we  prefer  to  approach therapy  with  many  rigid  preconceptions. We  feel  we  must  bring order  to  it. We  can  scarcely  dare  to  hope  that  we  can  discover order in it.\nThese are a  few  of the  personal  discoveries,  puzzlements,  and  dis­ couragements  which  I  encountered  in  working  on  this  problem. Out of these  came the more formal  ideas  which  I  would  now  like  to present.",

Likewise in  conceptualizing  the  process of  personality  change  in  psycho­ therapy,  I  shall  assume  a  constant  and  optimal  set  of  conditions  for facilitating this  change. I  have  recently  tried  to  spell  out  these  con­ ditions  in  some  detail  ( 8). For  our  present  purpose  I  believe  I  can state  this  assumed  condition  in  one  word. Throughout  the  discus­ sion  which  follows,  I  shall  assume  that  the  client  experiences  him­ self  as being  fully  received.

        "text": "In trying to  grasp  and  conceptualize  the  process  of  change,  I  was initially looking  for  elements  which  would  mark or characterize change  itself. I  was  thinking  of  change  as  an  entity,  and  searching for  its  specific  attributes. What  gradually  emerged  in  my  under­ standing  as  I  exposed  myself  to  the  raw  material  of  change  was  a continuum  of  a  different  sort  than  I  had  conceptualized  before.\nIndividuals  move,  I  began  to  see,  not  from  a  fixity  or  homeostasis through change to a new fixity,  though  such a  process  is  indeed  pos­ sible. But  much  the  more  significant  continuum  is  from  fixity  to changingness,  from  rigid  structure  to  flow,  from  stasis  to  process. I formed  the  tentative  hypothesis  that  perhaps  the  qualities  of  the client's  expression  at  any  one  point  might  indicate  his  position  on this  continuum,  might  indicate  where  he  stood  in  the  proccss  of change.\nI gradually  developed  this  concept  of  a  process,  discriminating seven  stages  in  it,  though  I  would  stress  that  it  is  a  continuum,  and that  whether  one  discriminated  three  stages  or  fifty,  there  would still be all the intermediate points.\nI came  to  feel  that  a  given  client,  taken  as  a  whole,  usually  ex­ hibits  behaviors  which  cluster  about  a  relatively  narrow  range  on this  continuum.  That  is,  it  is unlikely  that  in  one  area  of  his  life  the client  would  exhibit  complete  fixity,  and  in  another  area  complete changingness. He  would  tend,  as  a  whole,  to  be  at  some  stage  in this  process. However,  the  process  I  wish  to  describe  applies  more exactly, I believe, to given  areas of  personal meanings,  where  I hypothesize that the client would,  in such  an area, be  quite  definitely at one stage,  and  would  not  exhibit  characteristics  of  various  stages.",

However I  can to some degree illustrate the characteristics of this stage.\nThere  is  an  unwillingness  to  communicate  self. Communication  is only about externals.\nExample:  'Well,  I'll  tell  you,  it  always  seems  a  little  bit  nonsensi­ cal to talk  about one's self except in times of dire necessity.' *\nFeelings and personal meanings are neither recognized nor owned. Personal  constructs  (to  borrow  Kelly's  helpful  ter?n  (3)  )  are  ex­ tremely rigid.\nClose and communicative relationshipi are construed as dangerous. No problems are recognized or perceived at this stage. There is no desire to change.\nExample:  'I think I'm practically  healthy.'\nThere is much blockage of internal communication.\nPerhaps  these  brief  statements  and  examples  will  convey  some­ thing of the psychological  fixity  of  this  end  of  the  continuum. The\n· The  many  examples  used  as  illustrations  are  taken  from  recorded  inter­ views,  unless  otherwise noted.

        "text": "When the  person  in  the  first  stage  can  experience  himself as  fully received  then  the  second  stage  follows. We  seem  to  know  very little  about how  to  provide  the  experience  of  being  received  for  the person  in  the  first  stage,  but  it  is  occasionally  achieved  in  play  or group  therapy  where  the  person  can  be  exposed  to  a  receiving  cli­ mate,  without  himself  having to take any initiative, for  a long enough  time  to  experience  himself as received. In  any  event,  where he  does experience  this,  then a  slight  loosening and  flowing  of  sym­ bolic  expression  occurs,  which  tends  to  be  characterized  by  the  fol­ lowing.\nExpression begins to flow in regard to non-self topics.\nExample:  'I  guess  that  I  suspect  my  father  has  often  felt  very insecure in  his business relations.'\nProblems are perceived as external to self.\nExample:  'Disorganization keeps cropping up in my life.'\nThere is no sense of personal responsibility  in problems. Example:  This is illustrated in the above excerpt.\n134\nFeelings are described as unowned, or sometimes as past objects.\nExample:  Counselor:  'If  you  want  to  tell  me  something  of  what brought  you  here.  .  .  .' Client: ' The  symptom  was - it  was just being very depressed.'  This  is  an  excellent  example  of  the  way in  which  internal  problems  can  be  perceived  and communicated about  as  entirely  external. She  is  not  saying  ' I am  depressed'  or even 'I was depressed.'  Her feeling is  handled as a remote,  unowned object, entirely external to self.\nFeelings may be exhibited, but are not recognized as such or owned.\nExperiencing is bound by  the structure of the past.\nExample:  ' I  suppose  the  compensation  I  always  make  is,  rather than  trying  to  communicate  with  people  or  have  the  right  relation­ ship  with  them,  to  compensate  by,  well,  shall  we  say,  being  on  an intellectual level.' Here the client is beginning to  recognize the  way in  which  her  experiencing is  bound  by  the  past. Her statement  also illustrates the remoteness of experiencing at this level. It is as though she were holding her experience at arm's length.\nPersonal  constructs  are  rigid,  and  unrecognized as  being  constructs, but are thought of as facts.\nExample:  'I  can't  ever  do  anything  right - can't  ever  finish  it.' Differentiation  of personal meanings and feeli? gs is very  limited and 2 global.\nExample:  The  preceding  example  is  a  good  illustration. ' I can't ever'  is  one  instance  of  a  black  and  white  differentiation,  as  is  also the use of 'right' in this absolute sense.\nContradictions may  be  expressed,  but with little recognition  of them as contradictions.\nExample:  'I  want  to  know  things,  but  I  look  at  the  same  page for an hour.'\nAs  a  comment  on  this  second  stage  of  the  process  of  change,  it might  be  said  that  a  number  of  clients  who  voluntarily  come  for help  are  in  this  stage,  but  we  (and  probably  therapists  in  general) have  a  very  modest  degree  of  success  in  working  with  them. This\nseems at least, to be a  reasonable conclusion from Kirtner's study  (5), though his conceptual framework was somewhat different.  We seem to  know  too  little  about  the  ways  in  which  a  person  at  this  stage may come to experience himself as 'received.'",

Here  are  some  of  the  characteristics  which seem  to  belong  together  at  approximately  this  point  on  the  con­ tinuum.\nThere is a freer flow of expression about the self as an object.\nExample:  'I  try  hard  to  be  perfect  with  her - cheerful,  friendly, intelligent, talkative - because I want her to love me.'\nThere is also expression about self-related experiences as objects.\nExample:  'And yet there is the matter of, well,  how much do you leave  yourself open  to marriage,  and  if your  professional  vocation  is important,  and  that's  the  thing  that's  really  yourself  at  this  point,  it does  place  a  limitation  on  your  contacts.' In  this  excerpt  her  self is  such  a  remote  object that this would  probably best be classified  as being between stages two and three.\nThere is  also  expression  about  the  self  as  a  reflected  object,  existing primarily in others.\nExample:  'I  can  feel  myself  smiling sweetly  the  way  my  mother does,  or  being  gruff  and  important  the  way  my  father  does  some­ times- slipping into everyone else's personalities but mine.'\nThere  is  vmch  expression  about  or  description  of  feelings  and  per­ sonal meanings not now present.\nUsually,  of  course,  these  are  communications  about  past  feelings. Example:  There  were  'so  many  things  I  couldn't  tell  people nasty things I did.  I  felt so sneaky and bad.'\nExample:  'And this feeling that came  into  me was  just the  feeling that I remember as a kid.'\n136 T h e P r o c e s s o f B e c o m in g a P e r s o n There is very  little acceptance of feelings.  For the most part feelings are  revealed as something  shameful,  bady   or  abnormal,  or  unaccept­ able in other 'ways. Feelings  are  exhibited,  and  then  sometimes  recognized  as  feelings. Experiencing is described as in the  past,  or as somewhat remote from\nthe self.\nThe preceding examples illustrate this.\nPersonal  constructs  are  rigid,  but  may  be  recognized  as  constructs, not external facts.\nExample:  '1   felt guilty for so  much  of my young  life that I expect I  felt  I  deserved to be punished  most of the  time  anyway.  If I  didn't feel  I  deserved  it for one  thing,  I  felt  I  deserved  it for another.' Ob­ viously  he  sees  this  as  the  way  he  has  construed  experience  rather than as a settled fact.\nExample:  'I'm  so  much  afraid  wherever  affection  is  involved  it just means submission.  And this I  hate, but I  seem  to equate  the two, that  if  I  am  going to  get  affection,  then  it means  that  I  must  give  in to what the other person wants to do.'\nDifferentiation of feelings and  meanings  is  slightly sharper, less global, than in previous stages.\nExample:  'I  mean,  I  was  saying  it  before,  but  this  time  I  really felt  it. And  is  it  any  wonder  that  I  felt  so  darn  lousy  when  this was the way it was, th at. . .   they did  me a dirty  deal  plenty of times. And conversely, I was no angel about it; I realize that.'\nThere is a recognition of contradictions in experience.\nExample:  Client explains  that  on  the  one  hand  he  has  expectations of  doing something great;  on  the  other  hand  he  feels  he  may  easily end up as a bum.\nPersonal choices are often seen as ineffective.\nThe client  ' chooses'  to  do  something, but  finds  that  his  behaviors do not fall in line with this choice.\nI  believe it  will  be evident  that many  people  who seek psychologi­ cal  help  are  at  approximately  the  point  of  stage  three. They  may stay  at  roughly  this  point  for  a  considerable  time  describing  non­",

We  may try  to  capture  a number  of  the  characteristics  of  this  loosening, and term them the fourth phase of the process.\nThe client describes more  intense  feelings  of  the  ' not-noiv-present' variety.\nExample:  'Well, I was really - it hit me down deep.'\nFeelings are described as objects in the present.\nExample:  ' It  discourages  me  to  feel  dependent  because  it  means I'm kind of hopeless about myself.'\nOccasionally feelings  are expressed  as in the present, sometimes breaking through almost against the client's wishes.\nExample:  A  client, after discussing a dream  including  a bystander, dangerous  because of having  observed his ' crimes,' says to the therapist, 'Oh, all right,  I don't trust you.'\nThere  is  a  tendency  toward  experiencing  feelings  in  the  immediate present, and there is distrust and fear of this possibility.\nExample:  'I  feel  bound - by something  or  other. It  must be  me! There's  nothing  else  that  seems  to  be  doing  it. I can't  blame  it  on anything  else. There's  this  knot -  somewhere  inside  of  me.  .  .  . It makes me want to get mad - and cry - and run away!'\nThere  is  little  open  acceptance  of  feelings,  though  some  acceptance is exhibited.\nThe two preceding examples  indicate  that  the  client  exhibits  suffi­ cient  acceptance  of  his  experience  to  approach  some frightening feelings.  But there is little conscious acceptance of them.\nExperiencing  is  less  bound  by  the  structure  of  the  past,  is  less  re­ mote, and may occasionally occur with little postponement.\nAgain  the  two  preceding  examples  illustrate  very  well  this  less tightly bound manner of experiencing.\nThere is  a  loosening  of  the  way  experience  is  construed. There  are some discoveries of personal constructs; there is the  definite recogni­ tion  of  these  as  constructs;  and  there  is  a  beginning  questioning  of their validity.\nExample:  ' It amuses me. Why?  Oh, because it's a  little stupid  of me - and I  feel a  little  tense  about  it,  or  a  little  embarrassed, -  and a  little  helpless. (His  voice  softens  and  he  looks  sad.) Humor  has been my bulwark all my life; maybe it's a little out of place in trying to  really look at myself. A curtain to pull  down  . . .   I  feel  sort  of at a  loss  right now. Where was I? What was I saying? I  lost  m y  grip on something- that I've been holding myself up with.'  Here there seems  illustrated  the  jolting,  shaking  consequences  of  questioning  a basic construct, in this case his use of humor as a defense.\nThere is an  increased  differentiation  of feelings,  constructs,  personal meanings, with some  tendency  toward seeking exactness of symboli­ zation.\nExample:  This  quality  is  adequately  illustrated  in  each  of  the  ex­ amples in this stage.\nThere is a realization of concern about  contradictions and incongmences between experience and self.\nExample:  'I'm  not  living  up  to  what  I  am. I really  should  be doing more than I am.  How many hours  I spent  on the  john in  this position  with  Mother  saying, 'Don't come  out  'till you've  done something.' Produce!  . . .  That happened with lots of things.'\nThis  is  both  an  example  of  concern  about  contradictions  and  a questioning of the way in which experience has been construed.\nThere  are  feelings  of  self  responsibility in  problems,  though  such feelings vacillate.\nThough  a  close  relationship  still  seems  dangerous,  the  client  risks himself, relating to some sviall extent on a feeling basis.\nSeveral  of  the  above  examples  illustrate  this,  notably  the  one  in which the client says, ' Oh, all right, I don't trust you.'",

Listening  to  inter­ views  and  examining  typescripts  causes  me  to  believe  that  a  given client's  expressions  in  a  given  interview  may  be  made  up,  for  ex­ ample,  of  expressions  and  behaviors  mostly  characteristic  of  stage three,  with  frequent  instances  of  rigidity  characteristic  of stage  two or the  greater  loosening  of  stage  four.

If  we  limit  ourselves to  some  defined  area  of  related  personal  meanings  in  the  client,  then I  would  hypothesize  much  more  regularity;  that  stage  three  would rarely  be  found  before  stage  two;  that  stage  four  would  rarely  fol­ low stage two without stage three intervening.

Here  feelings  regarding  the  therapist  and  the  client  in relationship  to  the  therapist,  emotions  often  most  difficult  to  reveal, are  expressed openly.\n· The  further  we  go  up  the  scale,  the  less  adequate  are  examples  given  in print. The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  quality  of  experiencing  becomes  more important  at  these  upper  levels,  and  this  can  only  be  suggested  by  a  transcript, certainly  not  fully  communicated. Perhaps  in  time  a  series  of  recorded  ex­ amples can  be made  available.\nT h e P r o c e s s o f B i- x o m i k g a P e r s o n\nFeelings  are  very  close  to  being  fully  experienced. They  ' bubble u p ' ' seep through'  in  spite  of  the  fear  and  distrust  which the client feels at experiencing them with fullness and immediacy.\nExample:  'That  kinda  came  out  and  I  just  don't  understand  it. ( Long pause)  I'm trying to get hold of what that terror is.'\nExample:  Client  is  talking  about  an  external  event. Suddenly  she gets a pained, stricken look.\nTherapist:  ' W hat - what's hitting you now?'\nClient:  ' I  don't  know.  (She  cries)  . . .   I  must  have  been  getting a  little  too  close  to  something  I  didn't  want  to  talk  about,  or  some­ thing.' Here  the  feeling  has  almost  seeped  through  into  awareness in spite of her.\nExample:  ' I  feel stopped  right  now.  W hy is my  mind  blank  right now?  I  feel  as  if  I'm  hanging  onto  something,  and  I've  been  letting go  of  other  things;  and  something in  me  is  saying,  'What  more  do  I have to give up?' '\nThere  is  a  beginning  tendency  to  realize  that  experiencing a  feeling involves a direct referent.\nThe  three  examples  just  cited illustrate this. In  each  case the client  knows  he  has  experienced  something,  knows  he  is  not  clear  as to  what  he  has  experienced. But  there  is  also  the  dawning  realiza­ tion that  the referent  of these vague cognitions  lies within  him,  in an organismic  event  against  which  he  can  check  his  symbolization  and his  cognitive  formulations. This  is  often  shown  by  expressions  that indicate the closeness or distance he feels from this referent.\nExample:  'I  really  don't  have  my  finger  on  it. I'm  just kinda describing it.'\nThere  is  surprise  and  fright,  rarely  pleasure,  at  the  feelings  which ' bubble through'\nExample:  Client,  talking  about  past  home  relationships,  'That's not  important  any  more. Hmm.  (Pause)  That  was  somehow  very meaningful - but I  don't have  the slightest  idea  why.  .  .  .  Yes,  that's it! I can  forget  about  it  now  and - why,  it  isn't  that  important. Wow!  All that miserableness and stuff!'\nExample:  Client  has  been  expressing  his  hopelessness. ' I'm  still\nA  Process  Conception  of  Psychotherapy 141 amazed  at  the  strength  of  this. It  seems  to  be  so  much  the  way  I feel.'\nThere  is  an  in creasin g  ownership  of  self  feelings,  and  a  desire  to  be these, to be the ' real m e!'\nExample:  'The  real  truth  of  the  matter  is  that  I'm  not  the  sweet, forebearing guy  that  I  try  to  make  out  that  I  am. I  get  irritated  at things. I  feel  like  snapping  at  people,  and  I  feel  like  being  selfish  at times; and I don't know why I should pretend I'm not that wav.'\nThis  is  a  clear  instance  of  the  greater  degree  of  acccptance  of  all feelings.\nExperiencing  is  loosened,  no  longer  remote,  and  frequently  occurs with little postponement.\nThere  is  little  delay  between  the  organismic  event  and  the  full subjective  living of  it. A  beautifully  precise  account  of  this  is  given by a client.\nExample:  'I'm  still  having  a  little  trouble  trying  to  figure  out what this sadness - and the weepiness -  means.  I  just know I  feel it when  I  get  close  to  a  certain  kind  of  feeling - and  usually  when I  do  get  weepy,  it  helps  me  to  kinda  break  through  a  wall  I've  set up  because  of  things  that  have  happened. I feci  hurt  about  some­ thing and  then automatically this  kind  of shields things up and then  I feel  like  I  can't  really  touch  or  feel  anything  very  much  .  .  .  and if  I'd  be  able  to  feel,  or  could  let  myself  feel  the  instantaneous  feel­ ing  w hen  I'm  hurt.  I'd  immediately  start  being  weepy  right  then, but I can't.'\nHere  we  see  him  regarding  his  feeling  as  an  inner  referent  to which  he  can  turn  for greater  clarity.  As  he  senses  his weepiness  he realizes  that  it  is  a  delayed  and  partial  experiencing  of  being  hurt. He also  recognizes  that  his  defenses  are  such  that  he  cannot,  at  this point, experience the event of hurt when  it occurs.\nThe  ways  in  which experience is construed  are  much loosened. There  are  vtany  fresh  discoveries  of  personal  constructs  as  constructsj and a critical examination and questioning of these.\nExample:  A  man  says,  'This  idea  of  needing  to  please - of  hav­ ing  to  do  it - that's  really  been  kind  of  a  basic  assumption  of  my\nlife (he  weeps  quietly). It's kind  of,  you  know,  just  one  of  the very unquestioned axioms that I  have  to  please. I  have  no  choice. I just  have  to.' Here  he  is  clear  that  this  assumption  has  been  a  con­ struct, and it is evident that its unquestioned status is at an end.\nThere is a strong and evident tendency  toward exactness in  differen­ tiation of feelings and meanings.\nExample:  ' .  .  .  some  tension  that  grows  in  me,  or  some  hopeless­ ness,  or  some  kind  of  incompleteness - and  my  life  actually  is very incomplete right n ow .. . .  I just don't know.  Seems to be,  the  closest thing it  gets  to,  is  hopelessness.' Obviously,  he  is  trying  to  capture the exact term which for him symbolizes his experience.\nThere  is  an  increasingly  clear  facing  of  contradictions  and  incon­ gruences in experience.\nExample:  'My  conscious  mind  tells  me  I'm  worthy. But  some place  inside  I  don't  believe  it. I think  I'm  a  rat -  a  no-good. I've no faith in my ability to do anything.'\nThere  is  an  increasing  quality of  acceptance  of  self-responsibility for  the  problems  being  faced,  and  a  concern  as  to  how  he  has  con­ tributed. There  are  increasingly  freer  dialogues  within  the  self,  an improvement in and reduced blockage of internal communication.\nSometimes these dialogues are verbalized.\nExample:  'Something  in  me  is  saying,  'W hat  more  do  I  have  to give  up? You've  taken so  much  from  me  already.' This is  me  talk­ ing  to  me -  the  me  way  back  in  there  who  talks  to  the  me  who runs  the  show. It's complaining  now,  saying,  'You're  getting  too close! Go away!' '\nExample:  Frequently  these  dialogues  are  in  the  form  of  listening to oneself, to check cognitive formulations against the direct referent of  experiencing. Thus  a  client  says, ' Isn't that  funny? I never really  looked  at  it  that  way. I'm  just  trying  to  check  it. It  always seemed  to  me  that  the  tension  was  much  more  externally  caused than  this - that  it  wasn't  something  I  used  in  this  way. But  it's true - it's really true.'\nI  trust  that  the  examples  I  have  given  of  this  fifth  phase  of  be-\ncoining  a  process  will  make  several  points  clear. In  the  first  place this  phase  is  several  hundred  psychological  miles  from  the  first  stage described.  Here many aspects of the client are in flow, as against the rigidity  of  the  first  stage. He  is  very  much  closer  to  his  organic being,  which  is  always  in  process. He  is  much  closer  to  being  in the  flow  of  his  feelings. His  constructions  of  experience  are  decidely  loosened  and  repeatedly  being  tested  against  referents  and evidence  within  and  without. Experience  is  much  more  highly  dif­ ferentiated,  and  thus  internal  communication,  already  flowing,  can be much more exact.",

        "text": "Since  I  have  tended  to  speak  as  though  the  client  as  a  whole  is  at one stage or another, let me  stress  again,  before going on  to  describe the  next  stage,  that  in  given  areas  o f  personal  meaning,  the  process may  drop  below  the  client's  general  level  because  of  experiences which  are  so  sharply  at  variance  with  the  concept  of  self. Perhaps I  can illustrate,  from a single  area  in  the  feelings of  one  client,  some­ thing  of  the  way  the  process  I  am  describing  operates  in  one  nar­ row segment of experiencing.\nIn  a  case  reported  rather  fully  by  Shlien  (5) the  quality  of  the self-expression  in  the  interviews  has  been  at  approximately  points three  and  four  on  our  continuum  of  process. Then  when  she  turns to  the  area  of  sexual  problems,  the  process  takes  up  at  a  lower  level on the continuum.\nIn  the  sixth  interview  she  feels  that  there  are  things  it  would  be impossible  to  tell  the  therapist -  then  ' A fter  long  pause,  mentions almost inaudibly,  an  itching  sensation  in  the  area  of  the  rectum,  for which  a  physician  could  find  no  cause.' Here  a  problem  is  viewed as  completely  external  to  self,  the  quality  of  experiencing  is  very remote. It  would  appear  to  be  characteristic  of  the  second  stage  of process as we have described it.\nIn the tenth interview, the itching has moved  to her fingers.  Then with  great  embarrassment,  describes  undressing  games  and  other sex activities in childhood.  Here too the quality is that of telling of non­ self  activities,  with  feelings  described  as  past  objects,  though it is clearly  somewhat  further  on  the  continuum  of  process. She  con-\nludes 'because  I'm  just  bad,  dirty,  that's  all.' Here  is  an  expression about  the  self and  an  undifferentiated,  rigid  personal  construct. The quality  of  this  is  that  of  stage  three  in  our  process,  as  is  also  the following statement about self,  showing  more  differentiation  of per­ sonal  meanings.  ' I  think  inside  I'm  oversexed,  and  outside  not  sexy enough  to  attract  the  response  I  want.  . . .   I'd  like  to  be  the  same inside  and  out.' This  last  phrase  has  a  stage  four  quality  in  its  faint questioning of a personal construct.\nIn  the  twelfth  interview  she  carries  this  questioning  further,  de­ ciding she  was  not  just  born  to  be  promiscuous. This  has  clearly  a fourth  stage  quality,  definitely  challenging  this  deep-seated  way  of construing  her  experience. Also  in  this  interview  she  acquires  the courage  to  say  to  the  therapist;  'You're  a  man,  a  good  looking man, and  my  whole  problem  is  men  like  you. It  would  be  easier  if  you were  elderly - easier,  but  not  better,  in  the  long  run.' She  is  upset and embarrassed  having said  this  and  feels  ' it's  like  being  naked,  I'm so  revealed  to  you.' Here  an  immediate  feeling  is  expressed,  with reluctance  and  fear  to  be  sure,  but  expressed,  not  described. Ex­ periencing  is  much  less  remote  or  structure  bound,  and  occurs  with little  postponement, but with much  lack of acceptance. The sharper differentiation  of  meanings  is  clearly  evident  in  the  phrase  'easier but  not  better.' All  of  this  is  fully  characteristic  of  our  stage  four of process.\nIn  the fifteenth  interview  she  describes  many  past experiences  and feelings regarding sex,  these  having the  quality  of both  the third  and fourth  stage  as  we  have  presented  them. At  some  point  she  says, ' I  wanted  to  hurt  myself,  so  I  started  going  with  men  who  would hurt me - with  their penises. I  enjoyed  it,  and  was  being  hurt,  so  I had  the  satisfaction  of  being  punished for  my  enjoyment  at  the same  time.' Here  is  a  way  of  construing  experience  which  is  per­ ceived  as  just  that,  not  as  an  external  fact. It is also  quite  clearly being questioned,  though this questioning is implicit.  There  is recog­ nition  of  and  some  concern  regarding the  contradictory  elements  in experiencing  enjoyment,  yet  feeling  she  should  be  punished. These qualities  are all fully characteristic of  the fourth stage or even slightly beyond.\nA bit  later  she  describes  her  intense  past  feelings  of  shame  at  her\nenjoyment  of  sex. Her two  sisters,  the  ' neat,  respected  daughters' could  not  have  orgasms,  ' so  again  I  was  the  lud  one.' Up  to  this point  this again illustrates the fourth  stage. Then  suddenly she asks  ' Or  am  I  really  lucky?' In  the  quality  of  present  expression of  a  feeling  of  puzzlement,  in  the  'bubbling  through'  quality,  in the  immediate  experiencing  of  this  wonderment,  in  the  frank  and definite questioning  of  her  previous  personal construct, this has clearly  the  qualities  of  stage five, which  we  have  just  described. She  has moved forward  in  this process,  in a  climate  of acceptance,  a very considerable distance from stage two.\nI  hope  this example  indicates  the  way  in  which  an  individual,  in  a given  area  of  personal  meanings,  becomes  more  and  more  loosened, more  and  more  in  motion,  in  process,  as  she  is  received. Perhaps, too,  it  will  illustrate  what  I  believe  to  be  the  case,  that  this  process of  increased  flow  is  not  one  which  happens  in  minutes  or  hours,  but in  weeks,  or  months. It  is  an  irregularly  advancing  process,  some­ times retreating a bit, sometimes seeming not to advance as it broadens  out  to  cover  more  territory,  but  finally  proceeding  in  its further flow.",

        "text": "If  I have  been  able  to  communicate  some  feeling  for  the  scope and  quality  of  increased  loosening of  feeling,  experiencing  and  con­ struing  at  each  stage,  then  we  are  ready  to  look  at  the  next  stage which  appears,  from  observation,  to  be  a  very  crucial  one. Let  me see if I  can convey what I perceive to be its characteristic qualities.\nAssuming  that  the  client  continues  to  be  fully received in the therapeutic  relationship  then  the  characteristics  of  stage  five  tend  to be  followed  by  a  very  distinctive  and  often  dramatic  phase. It  is characterized as follows.\nA  feeling 'which  has  previously  been  ' stuck,\"  has  been  inhibited  in its process quality, is experienced with immediacy  now. A  feeling flows to its full result.\nA  present  feeling  is  directly  experienced  with  immediacy  and  rich­ ness.\nThis immediacy of experiencing, and the feeling which con­\n146 T h e P r o c e s s o f B e c o m in g a P e r s o n This  is  something  which  isy   not\nstitutes  its  content,  are  accepted. something to be denied, feared, struggled against.\nAll  the  preceding  sentences  attempt  to  describe  slightly  different facets  of  what  is,  when  it  occurs,  a  clear  and  definite  phenomenon. It would take recorded examples to communicate  its  full quality, but I  shall  try  to  give  an  illustration  without  benefit  of  recording. A somewhat extended  excerpt  from  the  80th  interview  with  a  young man may  communicate  the  way  in  which  a  client  comes  into  stage six.\nExample:  'I could  even conceive  of  it as  a  possibility that I  could have  a  kind  of  tender  concern  for  me.  .  .  .  Still,  how  could  1  be tender,  be  concerned  for  myself,  when  they're  one  and  the  same thing? But yet I can feel it so clearly.. . .  You know, like taking care of a child. You want to give it this and give it th at.. . .  I  can  kind of clearly  see  the  purposes  for  somebody  else  .  .  .  but  I  can  never  see them  for  .  .  .  myself,  that  I  could  do  this  for  me,  you  know. Is  it possible  that  I  can  really  want  to  take  care  of  myself,  and  make that a  major  purpose  of  my  life? That  means  I'd  have  to  deal  with the  whole  world  as  if  I  were  guardian  of  the  most  cherished  and most  wanted  possession,  that  this  I  was  between  this  precious  me that I  wanted  to  take  care  of and  the whole world.  .  . .   It's  almost  as if I loved myself - you know - that's strange -  but it's true.'\nTherapist:  It  seems  such  a  strange  concept  to  realize. Why  it would  mean  'I  would  face  the  world as though  a  part  of  my primary  responsibility  was  taking  care  of  this  precious  individual who is me - whom I love.'\nClient:  Whom  I  care  for - whom  I  feel  so  close  to. Woof! ! That's another strange one.\nTherapist: It just seems weird.\nClient:  Yeah. It  hits  rather  close  somehow. The  idea  of  my  lov­ ing  me  and  the  taking  care  of  me. (His  eyes  grow  moist.) That's a very nice one - very nice.'\nThe  recording would  help  to  convey  the  fact  that  here  is  a  feel­ ing which  has  never been able  to  flow  in  him,  which  is  experienced with  immediacy,  in  this  moment. It  is  a  feeling  which  flows  to  its full  result,  without  inhibition. It  is  experienced  acceptantly,  with no attempt to push it to one side, or to deny it.\nThere  is a  quality  of  living  subjectively  in  the  experience,  not  feel­ ing about it.\nThe client,  in  his  ivordsy   may  withdraw  enough  from  the  experi­ ence  to  feel  about  it,  as  in  the  above  example,  yet  the  recording makes  it  dear  that  his  words  are peripheral  to the experiencing which  is  going  on  within  him,  and  in  which  he  is  living. The  best communication  of  this  in  his  words  is  ' W oof! ! That's  another strange one.'",

        "text": "The  self,  at  this  moment,  is  this  feeling. This  is  a  being  in  the moment,  with  little  self-conscious  awareness,  but  with  primarily  a reflexive  awareness,  as  Sartre  terms  it. The  self  isf  subjectively,  in the existential moment.  It is not something one perceives.\nExperiencing, at this stage, takes on a real process quality.\nExample:  One  client,  a  man  who  is  approaching  this  stage,  says that  he  has  a  frightened  feeling  about  the  source  of  a  lot  of  secret thoughts  in  himself. He  goes  on;  ' The  butterflies  are  the  thoughts closest  to  the surface. Underneath  there's  a  deeper  flow. I feel very  removed  from  it all. The  deeper  flow  is  like  a  great  school  of fish  moving  under  the  surface. I see  the  ones  that  break  through the  surface  of the  water - sitting with  my  fishing  line  in  one  hand, with  a  bent  pin  on  the  end  of  it - trying to  find  a  better  tackle or better yet, a way of diving in.  That's  the  scary thing.  The  image I get is that I want to be one of the fish myself.'\nTherapist: ' You want to be down there flowing along, too.'\nThough this client is  not  yet fully  experiencing in  a  process  man­ ner,  and  hcnce  does  not  fully  exemplify  this  sixth  point  of  the  con­ tinuum,  he  foresees  it  so  clearly  that  his  description  gives  a  real sense of its meaning.\nAnother  characteristic  of  this  stage  of  process  is  the  physiological loosening 'which accompanies it.\nAloistness  in  the  eyes,  tears,  sighs, muscular  relaxation,  are  fre­ quently  evident. Often  there  are  other  physiological  concomitants. I  would  hypothesize  that  in  these  moments,  had  we  the  measure  for it,  we  would  discover  improved  circulation,  improved  conductivity\n148\nT h e P r o c e s s o f B e c o m in g a P e r s o n\nof nervous  impulses. An example  of the  'primitive'  nature  of  some of these sensations may be indicated in the following excerpt.\nExample:  The  client,  a  young  man,  has  expressed  the  wish  his parents  would  die  or  disappear. ' It's  kind  of  like  wanting  to  wish them  away,  and  wishing  they had never  been  . . . And  I'm  so ashamed  of  myself because  then  they  call  me,  and  off  I  go -  swish! They're  somehow still  so  strong. I don't  know. There's  some  um­ bilical- I  can  almost  feel  it  inside  m e- swish (and  he  gestures, plucking himself away by grasping at his navel.)'\nTherapist:  'They  really  do  have  a  hold  on  your  umbilical  cord.'\nClient:  ' It's funny  how  real it feels . .   .  It's like a  burning sensation, kind of, and when they say something which makes me anxious I can feel  it  right  here  (pointing).  1   never  thought  of  it  quite  that  way.'\nTherapist:  ' As  though  if  there's  a  disturbance  in  the  relationship between  you,  then  you  do  just  feel  it  as  though  it  was  a  strain  on your umbilicus.'\nClient:  'Yeah,  kind  of  like  in  my  gut  here. It's  so  hard  to  define the feeling that I  feel there.'\nHere  he  is  living subjectively  in  the  feeling  of  dependence  on  his parents. Yet  it  would  be  most  inaccurate  to  say  that  he  is  perceiv­ ing  it. He  is  in  it,  experiencing  it  as  a  strain  on  his  umbilical  cord. In this stagey internal communication  is  free and relatively un­ blocked.\nI  believe  this  is  quite  adequately  illustrated  in  the  examples  given. Indeed  the  phrase, ' internal communication'  is no longer  quite correct,  for as each  of these  examples  illustrates,  the  crucial  moment is  a  moment  of  integration,  in  which  communication  between  dif­ ferent internal foci  is no  longer necessary,  because  they  become  one.\nThe  incongruence  between  experience  and  awareness  is  vividly  ex­ perienced as it disappears into congruence.\nThe  relevant  personal  construct  is  dissolved  in this experiencing moment, and the client  feels  cut  loose  from  his previously  stabilized framework.\nI  trust  these  two  characteristics  may  acquire  more  meaning  from the  following  example. A  young  man  has  been  having  difficulty getting  close  to  a  certain  unknown  feeling. 'That's  almost  exactly\nwhat  the  feeling  is,  too - it  was  that  I  was  living  so  much  of  my life,  and  seeing so  much  of my life in  terms  of  being scared  of some­ thing.' He  tells  how  his  professional  activities  are  just  to  give  him a  little  safety  and  'a  little  world  where  I'll  be  secure,  you  know. And  for  the  same  reason. (Pause) I was  kind  of  letting  it  seep through. But  I  also  tied  it  in  with you  and  with  my  relationship with  you,  and  one  thing  I  feel  about  it  is  fear  of  its  going  away. (His  tone  changes to  role-play  more  accurately  his  feeling.) Won't you  let  me  have  this? I kind  of  need  it. I can  be  so  lonely  and scared without it.'\nTherapist:  ' M-hm,  m-hm.  'Let me  hang  on  to  it  because  I'd  be terribly  scared  if  I  didn't! . . . It's a kind  of  pleading  thing  too, isn't it?'\nClient: ' I  get  a  sense  of - it's  this  kind  of  pleading  little  boy. It's this gesture of begging. (Putting his hands up as if in prayer.)\nTherapist: ' You put your hands in kind of a supplication.'\nClient:  ' Yeah,  that's  right. ' Won't  you  do  this  for  me?'  kind  of. Oh,  that's  terrible! Who,  Me? Beg?  .  . . That's  an  emotion  I've never  felt  clearly  at  all - something  I've  never  been  .  .  . (Pause) .  . . I've  got  such  a  confusing  feeling. One  is,  it's  such  a  wondrous feeling to  have  these  new  things  come  out  of  me. It  amazes  me  so much  each time,  and  there's  that  same  feeling,  being scared  that  I've so  much  of  this.  (Tears)  . . .   I  just  don't  know  myself. Here's  sud­ denly  something  I  never  realized,  hadn't  any  inkling  of - that  it was some thing or way I wanted to be.'\nHere  we  see  a  complete  experiencing  of  his  pleadingncss,  and  a vivid  recognition  of  the  discrepancy  between  this  experiencing  and his concept of himself. Yet this experiencing of discrepancy exists  in the  moment of its  disappearance. From  now on  he  is  a  person  who feels  pleading,  as  well  as  many  other  feelings. As  this  moment  dis­ solves  the  way  he  has  construed  himself  he  feels  cut  loose  from  his previous world - a sensation which  is  both  wondrous  and  frighten­ ing.\nThe  moment  of  full  experiencing  becomes  a  clear  and  definite  ref­ erent.\nThe examples given should indicate  that  the  client is  often  not too\nclearly  aware  of  what  has  ' hit  him'  in  these  moments. Yet  this does  not  seem  too  important  because  the  event  is  an  entity,  a  refer­ ent,  which  can  be  returned  to,  again  and  again,  if  necessary,  to  dis­ cover  more about it. The  pleadingness, the feeling of ' loving myself'  which  are  present  in  these  examples,  may  not  prove  to  be exactly as described.  They are,  however, solid  points of reference  to which  the  client  can  return  until  he  has  satisfied  himself  as  to  what they are.  It is,  perhaps,  that they constitute  a  clear-cut physiological event, a substratum of the conscious life,  which  the  client  can  return to  for  investigatory  purposes. Gendlin  has  called  my  attention  to this significant quality of experiencing as a  referent.  He is endeavor­ ing to build an extension  of psychological theory  on this basis.  ( 1)\nDiffere?itiatio?i  of experiencing is sharp and basic.\nBecause  each  of  these  moments  is  a  referent,  a  specific  entity,  it does not become confused  with  anything else.  The process of sharp differentiation builds on it and about it.\nIn  this  stagey   there  are  no  longer  ' problem s'  external  or  internal. The client is  living, subjectively, a phase  of his problem. It is  not an object.\nI trust  it  is  evident  that  in  any  of  these  examples,  it  would  be grossly  inaccurate  to  say  that  the  client  perceives  his  problem  as internal,  or  is  dealing with  it  as  an  internal  problem. We need some way  of  indicating  that  he  is  further  than  this,  and  of  course  enor­ mously  far  in  the  process  sense  from  perceiving  his  problem  as  ex­ ternal. The  best  description  seems  to  be  that  he  neither  perceives his problem nor deals with it.  He  is simply  living some  portion  of it knowingly and acceptingly.\nI  have  dwelt  so  long  on  this  sixth  definable  point  on  the  process continuum  because  I  see  it  as  a  highly  crucial  one. My  observa­ tion  is  that  these  moments  of  immediate,  full,  accepted  experiencing are  in  some  sense  almost  irreversible. To  put  this  in  terms  of  the examples, it  is my  observation  and  hypothesis that  with  these  clients, whenever  a  future  experiencing of  the  same  quality  and  characteris­ tics  occurs,  it  will  necessarily  be  recognizcd  in  awareness  for  what it  is: a  tender caring for self,  an  umbilical  bond  which  makes  him  a",

        "text": "In  those  areas  in  which  the  sixth  stage  has  been  reached,  it  is  no longer so necessary that the client be  fully received  by  the  therapist, though  this  still  seems  helpful. However,  because  of  the  tendency for  the  sixth  stage  to  be  irreversible,  the  client  often  seems  to  go  on into the seventh  and  final stage  without  much  need  of the therapist's help. This  stage  occurs  as  much  outside  of  the  therapeutic  relation­ ship  as  in  it,  and  is  often  reported,  rather  than  experienced  in  the therapeutic  hour. I shall  try  to  describe  some  of  its  characterictics as I  feel I  have observed them.\nNew  feelings  are  experienced  with  immediacy  and  richness  of  de­ tailboth in the therapeutic relationship and outside. The experiencing of such feelings is used as a clear referent.\nThe  client  quite  consciously  endeavors  to  use  these  referents  in order to  know  in  a  clearer  and  more  differentiated  way  who  he  is, what  he  wants,  and  what  his  attitudes  are. This  is  true  even  when the feelings are unpleasant or frightening.\nThere  is a  growing  and  continuing sense  of acceptant  ownership  of these changing feelingsy  a basic trust in his own process.\nThis trust is  not primarily  in the conscious processes which  go  on, but  rather  in  the  total  organismic  process. One  client  describes  the way  in  which  experience  characteristic  of  the  sixth  stage  looks  to him, describing it in terms characteristic of the seventh stage.\n' In  therapy  here,  what  has  counted  is  sitting  down  and  saying, 'this  is  what's  bothering  me,'  and  play  around  with  it  for  awhile until  something  gets squeezed out through  some  emotional  cre­ scendo,  and  the  thing  is  over  with - looks  different. Even  then,  I can't tell  just exactly  what's happened. It's  just  that  I  exposed  some­ thing,  shook  it  up  and  turned  it  around;  and  when  I  put  it  back it  felt better. It's  a  little  frustrating  because  I'd  like  to  know  exactly what's going on.  .  .  .  This  is  a  funny  thing  because  it  feels  as  if  I'm\nnot  doing anything at all  about it - the  only  active  part  I  take  is  to - to  be  alert  and  grab  a  thought  as  it's  going  by  .  .  .  And  there's sort  of  a  feeling,  'W ell  now,  what  will  I  do  with  it,  now  that  l've seen  it  right?' There's  no  handles  on  it  you  can  adjust or  anything. Just  talk  about  it  awhile,  and  let  it  go. And  apparently  that's  all there  is  to  it. Leaves me with a  somewhat unsatisfied  feeling though - a  feeling  that  I  haven't  accomplished  anything. It's  been  accom­ plished  without  my knowledge or  consent.  .  .  .  The  point  is  I'm  not sure  of  the  quality  of  the  readjustment  because  I  didn't  get  to  see it,  to  check  on  it.  .  .  .  All  I  can  do  is  observe  the  facts -  that  I  look at  things  a  little  differently  and  am  less  anxious,  by  a  long  shot, and  a  lot  more  active. Things  are  looking  up  in  general. I'm  very happy  with  the  way  things  have  gone. But  I  feel  sort  of  like  a spectator.' A  few  moments  later,  following  this  rather  grudging acceptance  of  the  process  going on in  him,  he  adds,  ' I  seem to  work best  when  my  conscious  mind  is  only  concerned  with  facts  and letting  the  analysis  of  them  go  on  by  itself  without  paying  any attention to it.'\nExperiencing  has  lost  almost  completely  its  structure-bound  aspects and  becomes  process  experiencing - that  isy   the  situation  is  experi­ enced and interpreted in its newness, not as the past.\nThe example given  in stage  six suggests the  quality  I  am  trying  to describe. Another  example  in  a  very  specific  area  is  given  by  a client  in  a  follow-up  interview  as  he  explains  the  different  quality that  has  come  about  in  his  creative  work. It used  to  be  that  he tried  to  be  orderly. ' You  begin  at  the  beginning  and  you  progress regularly  through  to  the  end.' Now  he  is  aware  that  the  process in  himself  is  different. 'When  I'm  working  on  an  idea,  the  whole idea  develops  like  the  latent  image  coming  out  when  you  develop  a photograph.  It doesn't start at one edge and  fill  in  over to the other. It  comes  in  all  over. At  first  all  you  see  is  the  hazy  outline,  and you wonder what it's  going to be; and then gradually  something fits here  and  something  fits  there,  and  pretty  soon  it  all  comes  clear all  at  once.' It  is  obvious  that  he  has  not  only  come  to  trust  this process,  but  that  he  is  experiencing  it  as  it  is,  not  in  terms  of  some past.\nThe  self  becomes  increasingly  simply  the  subjective  and  reflexive awareness  of  experiencing. The  self  is  much  less  frequently  a  per­ ceived  object,  and  much  more  frequently something  confidently felt in process.\nAn example may be taken from the same follow-up interview with the client quoted above. In this interview, because  he  is reporting  his experience  since  therapy,  he  again  becomes  aware  of  himself  as  an object, but it is  clear that this  has  not been  the quality of his  day-byday  experience. After  reporting  many  changes,  he  says,  ' I  hadn't really  thought  of  any  of  these  things  in  connection  with  therapy until  tonight.  .  .  . (Jokingly)  Gee!  maybe  something  did  happen. Because  my  life  since  has  been  different. My productivity  has  gone up. My confidence  has  gone  up. I've  become  brash  in  situations  I would have  avoided  before.  And  also,  I've  become  much  less  brash in situations where I  would have become  very obnoxious  before.'  It is clear that only afterward does he realize what his self has been.\nPersonal  constructs  are tentatively reformulated, to be validated against further experience, but even then, to be held loosely.\nA  client  describes  the  way  in  which  such  a  construct  changed, between interviews, toward the end of therapy.\n' I don't  know  what (changed),  but  I definitely  feel different about  looking  back  at  my  childhood, and some  of  the  hostility about  my  mother  and  father  has  evaporated. I substituted for  a feeling of resentment about them a sort of acceptance of the fact that they  did  a  number  of  things  that  were  undesirable  with  me. But  I substituted  a  sort  of  feeling  of  interested  excitement  that - gee now that I'm finding out what was wrong,  7 can do something about it - correct  their  mistakes.' Here  the  way  in  which  he  construes his experience with his parents has been sharply altered.\nAnother  example  may  be  taken  from  an  interview  with  a  clicnt who  has  always  felt  that  he  had  to  please  people. ' I can  sec  .  . . what  it  would  be  like - that  it  doesn't  matter  if  I  don't  please  you - that  pleasing  you  or  not  pleasing  you  is  not  the  thing  that  is important  to  me. If  I could  just  kinda  say  that  to  people - you know?  ..  .  the  idea  of  just  spontaneously  saying something - and  it not  mattering  whether  it  pleases  or  not - Oh  God!  you  could  say\nalmost  anything:  But  that's  true,  you  know.' And  a  little  later  he asks  himself,  with  incredulity,  ' You  mean  if  I'd  really  be  what  I feel  like  being,  that  that  would  be  all  right?' He  is  struggling  to­ ward a rcconstruing of some very basic aspects of his experience.\nInternal  communication  is  clear,  with  feelings  and  symbols  well matched, and fresh terms for new feelings.\nThere is the experiencing  of effective  choice  of  new  ways  of  being.\nBecause  all  the  elements  of  experience  are  available  to  awareness, choice  becomes  real  and  effective. Here  a  client  is  just  coming  to this  realization. ' I'm  trying  to  encompass a  way  of  talking  that  is  a way  out  of  being  scared  of  talking. Perhaps  just  kind  of  thinking out  loud  is  the  way  to  do  that. But  I've  got  so  many  thoughts  I could  only  do  it  a  little  bit. But  maybe  I  could  let  my  talk  be  an expression  of  my  real  thoughts,  instead  of  just  trying  to  make  the proper noises in each situation.' Here  he  is sensing the  possibility of effective choice.\nAnother  client  comes  in  telling  of  an  argument  he  had  with  his wife. ' I wasn't  so angry  with  myself. I didn't hate myself  so much. I realized  'I'm  acting  childishly'  and  somehow  I  chose  to do that.'\nIt  is  not  easy  to  find  examples  by  which  to  illustrate  this  seventh stage,  because  relatively  few  clients  fully  achieve  this point. Let  me try  to  summarize  briefly  the  qualities  of  this  end  point  of  the  con­ tinuum.\nWhen  the  individual  has,  in  his  process  of  change,  reached  the seventh  stage,  we  find  ourselves  involved  in  a  new  dimension. The client has now  incorporated  the  quality  of  motion, of  flow, of changingness,  into  every  aspect  of  his  psychological  life,  and  this becomes  its outstanding  characteristic. He  lives in his feelings, knowingly  and  with  basic  trust  in  them  and  acceptance  of  them. The  ways  in  which  he  construes  experience  are  continually  chang­ ing as his personal  constructs  are modified  by  each new  living  event. His  experiencing is  process  in  nature,  feeling  the  new  in  each  situa­ tion  and  interpreting  it  anew,  interpreting  in  terms  of  the  past  only to  the  extent that  the  now is identical  with the past. He experiences with  a  quality  of  immediacy,  knowing  at  the  same  time  that  he  ex­\nperiences. He  values  exactness  in  differentiation  of  his  feelings  and of  the  personal  meanings  of  his  experience. His  internal  communi­ cation  between  various  aspects  of  himself  is  free  and  unblocked. He  communicates  himself  freely  in  relationships  with  others,  and these  relationships  are  not  stereotyped,  but  person  to  person. He  is aware of himself, but not as an object.  Rather it is a reflexive aware­ ness,  a  subjective  living  in  himself  in  motion. He  perceives  him­ self  as  responsibly  related  to  his  problems. Indeed,  he  feels  a  fully responsible  relationship  to  his  life  in  all  its  fluid  aspects. He  lives fully in himself as a constantly changing flow of process.\nS o m f. Q uestions  R egarding  T his P rocess  C o n t in u u m\nLet  me  try  to  anticipate  certain  questions  which  may  be  raised about the process I  have tried to describe.\nIs  this  the  process  by  which  personality  changes  or  one  of  many kinds  of  change? This  I  do  not  know. Perhaps  there  are  several types of process by  which  personality changes. I would only specify  that  this  seems  to  be  the  process  which  is  set  in  motion when the individual experiences himself as being fully received.\nDocs  it  apply  in  all  psychotherapies,  or  is  this  the  process  which occurs  in  one  psychotherapeutic  orientation  only? Until  we  have more  recordings  of  therapy  from  other  orientations,  this  question cannot be answered.  However,  I  would  hazard  a  guess  that perhaps therapeutic  approaches  which  place  great  stress  on  the  cognitive and  little  on  the  emotional  aspects  of  experience  may  set  in  motion an entirely different process of change.\nWould  everyone  agree  that  this  is  a  desirable  process  of  change, that  it  moves  in  valued  directions? I believe  not. I believe  some people  do  not  value  fluidity. This  will  be  one  of  the  social  value judgments  which  individuals  and  cultures  will  have  to  make. Such a  process  of  change  can  easily  be  avoided,  by  reducing  or  avoiding those  relationships  in  which  the  individual  is  fully  received  as  he  is.\nIs  change  on  this  continuum  rapid? Aly  observation  is  quite  the contrary.  M y  interpretation  of  Kirtner's  study  (4),  which  may  be slightly  different  from  his,  is  that  a  client  might  start therapy  at about  stage  two  and  end  at  about  stage  four  with  both  client  and therapist  being  quite  legitimately  satisfied  that  substantial  progress\nhad  been  made. It  would  occur  very  rarely,  if  ever,  that  a  clicnt who  fully  exemplified  stage  one  would  move  to  a  point  where  he fully  exemplified  stage  seven. If  this  did  occur,  it  would  involve  a matter of years.\nAre  the  descriptive  items  properly  grouped  at  each  stage? I  feel sure  that  there  are  many  errors  in  the  way  I  have  grouped  my  ob­ servations. I also wonder  what important elements have been omitted. I wonder  also  if  the  different  elements  of  this  continuum might  not  be  more  parsimoniously  described. All  such  questions, however,  may  be  given  an  empirical  answer,  if  the  hypothesis  I  am setting forth has merit in the eyes of various research workers.",

        "text": "I have  tried  to  sketch,  in  a  crude  and  preliminary  manner,  the flow  of a  process  of change  which  occurs  when  a  client  experiences himself  as being  received,  welcomed,  understood  as  he is. This process  involves  several  threads,  separable  at  first,  becoming  more of a unity as the process continues.\nThis process involves  a  loosening  of  feelings. At  the  lower  end of  the  continuum  they  are  described  as  remote,  unowned,  and  not now present.  They  are  then  described  as  present  objects  with  some sense  of  ownership  by  the  individual. Next  they  are  expressed  as owned  feelings in terms closer to their immediate  experiencing.  Still further up  the scale they are experienced  and expressed  in the  imme­ diate  present  with  a  decreasing  fear  of  this  process. Also,  at  this point, even  those  feelings  which  have  been  previously  denied  to awareness  bubble  through  into  awareness,  are  experienced,  and  in­ creasingly  owned. At the  upper  end  of the  continuum  living  in  the process  of  experiencing  a continually  changing  flow of feelings becomes characteristic of the individual.\nThe process involves a change in the manner of experiencing.  The continuum  begins  with  a  fixity  in  which  the  individual  is  very  re­ mote  from  his  experiencing and  unable  to  draw  upon  or  symbolize its implicit  meaning. Experiencing  must  be  safely  in  the  past  be­ fore  a  meaning  can  be  drawn  from  it  and  the  present  is  interpreted in  terms  of  these  past  meanings. From  this  remoteness  in  relation to  his  experiencing,  the  individual  moves  toward  the  recognition  of\nexperiencing as a troubling process going  on within  him.  Experienc­ ing  gradually  bccomes  a  more  accepted  inner  referent  to  which  he can  turn  for  increasingly  accurate  meanings. Finally  he  becomes able to  live  freely  and  acceptantly  in  a  fluid  process  of experiencing, using it comfortably as a major reference for his behavior.\nThe  process  involves  a  shift  from  incongruence  to  congruence. The  continuum  runs  from  a  maximum  of  incongruence  which  is quite  unknown  to  the  individual  through  stages  where  there  is  an increasingly sharp recognition of the contradictions and  discrepancies existing  within  himself  to  the  experiencing  of  incongruence  in  the immediate  present in  a  way  which  dissolves  this. At  the  upper  end of  the  continuum,  there  would  never  be  more  than  temporary  in­ congruence between experiencing and awareness since  the  individual would  not  need  to  defend  himself  against  the  threatening  aspects of his experience.\nThe  process  involves  a  change  in  the  manner  in  which,  and  the extent  to  which  the  individual  is  able  and  willing  to  communicate himself in a receptive climate.  The continuum  runs from  a complete unwillingness to  communicate self  to  the  self as  a  rich  and  changing awareness  of  internal  experiencing  which  is  readily  communicated when the individual desires to do so.\nThe  process  involves  a  loosening  of  the  cognitive  maps  of  ex­ perience. From  construing experience in rigid ways  which  are perceived  as external facts, the client moves  toward developing changing,  loosely  held  construings  of  meaning  in  experience,  con­ structions which are modifiable by each new experience.\nThere  is  a  change  in  the  individual's  relationship  to  his  problems. At  one  end  of the  continuum  problems  are  unrecognized  and  there is no desire to change.  Gradually there is a recognition that problems exist. At  a  further  stage,  there  is recognition  that  the  individual has  contributed  to  these  problems,  that  they  have  not  arisen  en­ tirely  from  external  sources. Increasingly,  there  is  a  sense  of  selfresponsibility  for  the  problems. Further  up  the  continuum  there  is a living or experiencing of some aspect of the problems.  The person lives his problems  subjectively, feeling responsible for the con­ tribution he has made in the development of his problems.\nThere is change in the individual's manner of  relating.  At one  end\nof  the  continuum  the  individual  avoids  close  relationships,  which are perceived as being dangerous.  At the other end of the continuum, he  lives  openly  and  freely  in  relation  to  the  therapist  and  to  others, guiding his behavior in  the relationship on the basis of his immediate experiencing.\nIn  general,  the  process  moves  from a  point  of fixity,  where  all  the elements and threads described above are separately discernible and  separately  understandable, to the flowing  peak moments  of therapy  in  which  all  these  threads  become  inseparably  woven  to­ gether. In  the  new  experiencing  with  immediacy  which  occurs  at such  moments, feeling  and cognition interpenetrate, self is sub­ jectively  present  in  the  experience,  volition  is  simply  the  subjective following  of  a  harmonious  balance  of  organismic  direction. Thus, as the  process reaches this  point  the  person becomes a unity of  flow, of  motion. He  has  changed,  but  what  seems  most  significant,  he has become an integrated process of changingness.",

I  do  not  share  this reaction. I cannot  help  but  puzzle  over  the  meaning  of  what  1 observe. Some of these meanings seem to  have  exciting implications for our modern world.\nIn 1951 Dr. Russell Becker, a friend, former student and  colleague of  mine,  invited  me  to  give  a  special  lecture  to  an  all-college  con­ vocation  at  Wooster  College  in  Ohio. I  decided  to  work  out  more clearly for  myself  the  meaning  of  the  personal  directions  which clients  seem  to  take  in  the  free  climate  of  the  therapeutic  relation­ ship. When  the  paper  was  finished  I  had  grave  doubts  that  I  had expressed  anything  which  was  in  any  way  new  or  significant. The rather  astonishingly long-continued  applause of the audience  re­ lieved my fears to some degree.\nAs the passage of time has enabled me  to  look more  objectively  at what  I  said,  I  feel  satisfaction  on  two  counts. I  believe  it  expresses well  the  observations  which  for  me  have  crystallized  into  two  im­ portant  themes:  my  confidence  in  the  human  organism,  when  it  is functioning  freely;  and  the  existential  quality  of  satisfying  living,  a theme  presented  by  some  of  our  most  modem  philosophers,  which\n163\n164\nh'js  however  beautifully  expressed  more  than  twenty-five  centuries ago by Lao-tzu, n'ken he said. ' The iL\\iy to do is to be.'",

'What  is my purpose?'*  These are questions which  even*  individual  asks  him­ self  at one  time  or  another, sometimes  calmly  and  meditatively, sometimes  in  agonizing  uncertainty  or  despair. They  are  old,  old questions  which  have  been  asked  and  answered  in  every  century of history.  Yet  they  are  also  questions  which  every  individual  must ask  and  answer  for  himself,  in  his  own  way. They  are  questions which  I,  as  a  counselor,  hear  expressed  in  many  differing  ways  as men  and  women  in  personal  distress  try  to  learn,  or  understand,  or choose, the directions which their lives are taking.\nIn  one  sense  there  is  nothing  new  which  can  be  said  about  these questions. Indeed  the  opening  phrase  in  the  title  I  have  chosen  for this  paper  is  taken  from  the  writings  of  a  man  who  wrestled  with these  questions  more  than  a  century  ago. Simply  to  express  an­ other  personal  opinion  about  this  whole  issue  of  goals  and  purposes would  seem  presumptuous. But  as  I  have  worked  for  many  years with troubled and maladjusted individuals I believe that I can discern  a  pattern, a trend,  a commonality,  an  orderliness,  in  the tentative answers to these questions which they have found for them­ selves. And  so  I  would  like  to  share  with  you  my  perception  of what human beings appear to  be  striving for,  when  they  are  free  to choose.",

WTien  men  in  the past  have  asked  themselves  the  purpose  of life,  some  have  answered, in  the  words  of  the  catechism,  that  ' the  chief  end  of  man  is  to glorify  God.' Others  have  thought  of  life's  purpose  as  being  the preparation  of  oneself  for  immortality. Others  have  settled  on  a\nmuch  more  carthv  goal - to  enjoy  and  release  and  satisfy  every sensual  desire. Still  others - and  this  applies  to  many  today - re­ gard  the  purpose  of  life  as  being  to  achieve - to  gain  material  pos­ sessions,  status, knowledge,  power. Some  have  made  it  their  goal to  give  themselves  completely  and  devotedly  to  a  cause  outside  of themselves  such  as  Christianity,  or  Communism. A  Hitler  has  seen his goal as  that of becoming the  leader of a master  race  which would exercise  power  over  all. In  sharp  contrast,  many  an  Oriental  has striven  to  eliminate  all  personal  desires,  to  exercise  the  utmost  of control  over  himself. I mention  these  widely  ranging  choices  to indicate  some  of the  very  different  aims  men  have  lived  for,  to  sug­ gest that there are indeed many goals possible.\nIn a recent important study Charles Alorris investigated ob­ jectively  the  pathways  of  life  which  were  preferred  by  students  in six different countries - India, China, Japan, the United States, Canada,  and  Norway  (5). As  one  might  expect,  he  found  decided differences  in  goals  between  these  national groups. He  also en­ deavored,  through  a  factor  analysis  of  his  data,  to  determine  the underlying  dimensions  of  value  which  seemed  to  operate in the thousands  of  specific  individual  preferences. Without  going  into the details of his analysis, we might look at the five  dimensions which emerged,  and which, combined  in  various  positive and negative ways, appeared to be responsible for the individual choices.\nThe  first  such  value  dimension  involves  a  preference  for  a  re­ sponsible, moral,  self-restrained participation in life, appreciating and conserving what man has attained.\nThe  second  places  stress  upon  delight  in  vigorous  action  for  the overcoming of obstacles. It  involves a  confident  initiation  of change, either  in  resolving  personal  and  social  problems,  or  in  overcoming obstacles in the natural world.\nThe third dimension stresses  the value  of a self-sufficient inner  life with  a  rich  and  heightened  self-awareness. Control  over  persons and tilings is  rejected in favor of a  deep  and  sympathetic  insight into self and others.\nThe  fourth  underlying  dimension  values  a  receptivity  to  persons and  to  nature. Inspiration  is  seen  as  coining  from  a  source  outside\nthe  self,  and  the  person  lives  and develops  in  devoted  responsive­ ness to this source.\nThe  fifth  and  final  dimension  stresses  sensuous  enjoyment,  selfenjoyment. The  simple  pleasures  of  life,  an  abandonment  to  the moment, a relaxed openness to life, are valued.\nThis  is  a  significant  study,  one  of  the  first  to  measure  objectively the  answers  given  in  different  cultures  to  the  question,  what  is  the purpose  of  my  life? It  has  added  to  our  knowledge  of  the  answers given. It  has  also  helped  to  define  some  of  the  basic  dimensions  in terms  of  which  the  choice  is  made. As  Morris  says,  speaking  of these  dimensions,  'it  is  as if persons  in  various cultures  have  in common  five  major  tones  in  the  musical  scales  on  which  they  com­ pose different melodies.'

None of the  'W ays  to  Live'  which  Morris  put  before  the  students as possible  choices,  and  none  of the  factor  dimensions, seems to  con­ tain  satisfactorily  the  goal  of  life  which  emerges  in  my  experience with  my  clients. As  I  watch  person  after  person  straggle  in his therapy hours to  find  a  way  of  life  for  himself,  there  seems  to  be  a general  pattern  emerging,  which  is  not  quite  captured  by  any  of Morris'  descriptions.\nThe  best  way  I  can  state  this  aim  of  life,  as  I  see  it  coming  to light  in  my  relationship  with  my  clients,  is to use  the words  of S0ren Kierkegaard - 'to be that self which  one  truly is.' (3,  p.  29) I  am quite aware that this mny sound so simple as to be absurd. T o be what one is seems like a statement of obvious fact rather than  a  goal. What  does  it  mean? What  does  it  imply? I want  to  devote  the remainder  of  my  remarks  to  those  issues. I will  simply  say  at  the outset  that  it  seems  to  mean  and  imply  some  strange  things. Out of  my  experience  with  my  clients,  and  out  of  my  own  self-search­ ing,  I  find  myself  arriving  at  views  which  would  have  been  very foreign  to  me  ten  or  fifteen  years  ago. So  I  trust  you  will  look at  these  views  with  critical  scepticism,  and  accept  them  only  in  so far as they ring true in your own experience.",

In other  words  even  though  there  may  be  no  recognition  of  what  he might be  moving toward,  he  is  moving  away  from  something.  And of  course  in  so  doing  he  is  beginning  to  define,  however  negatively, what he is.\nAt first this may be expressed  simply as  a fear of exposing what he is. Thus  one  eighteen-year-old  boy  says,  in  an  early  interview:  'I know I'm  not so  hot,  and  I'm  afraid  they'll  find  it  out. That's  why I  do  these  things.  .  .  .  T h ey 're  going  to  find  out  some  day  that  I'm not so hot.  I'm just trying to put that day  off as  long as possible.  .  . . If  you  know  me  as  I  know  myself -.  (Pause)  I'm  not  going  to  tell you  the person  I  really  think  I  am. There's  only  one  place  I  won't cooperate  and  that's  it.  .  .  .  It  w ouldn't  help  your  opinion  of  me  to know what I think of myself.'\nIt  will  be  clear  that  the  very  expression  of  this  fear  is  a  part  of becoming what he is.  Instead  of simply  being a  fa5ade,  as  if  it were himself,  he  is  coming  closer  to  being  himself,  namely  a  frightened\n· I cannot  close  my  mind,  however,  to  the  possibility  that  someone  might be  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  trends  I  am  about  to  describe  might  in  some subtle  fashion,  or  to  some  degree,  have  been  initiated  by  me. I  am  describing them  as  occurring  in  the  client  in  this  safe  relationship,  because  that  seems  the most likely explanation.\n168\nperson  hiding  behind  a  facade  because  he  regards  himself  as  too awful to be seen.",

        "text": "Another  tendency of this sort seems evident in the client's moving away from  the  compelling  image of what  he  'ought to  be.' Some  individuals  have  absorbed  so  deeply  from  their  parents  the concept  ' I  ought  to  be  good,'  or  ' I have  to  be  good,'  that  it  is only  with  the  greatest  of  inward  struggle  that  they  find  themselves moving  away  from  this  goal. Thus  one  young  woman,  describing her  unsatisfactory  relationship  with  her  father,  tells  first  how  much she  wanted  his  love. ' I think  in  all  this  feeling  I've  had  about  my father,  that  really  I  did  very  much  want  a  good  relationship  with him.  . . .   I  wanted  so  much  to  have  him  care  for  me,  and  yet  didn't seem to get what I really wanted.' She always felt she had to meet all of his  demands and  expectations and  it  was  ' just too  much. Because once  I  meet  one  there's  another  and  another  and  another,  and  I never  really  meet  them. It's  sort  of  an  endless  demand.' She  feels she  has  been  like  her  mother,  submissive  and  compliant,  trying  con­ tinually  to  meet  his  demands. 'And  really  not  wanting  to  be  that kind  of person. I  find  it's  not  a  good  w ay  to be,  but  yet  I  think  I've had a sort of belief that  that's  the  way  you  have  to  be  if  you  intend to be  thought  a  lot of  and  loved. And  yet  who  would  ivant  to  love somebody  who  was  that  sort  of  wishy  washy  person?' The  coun­ selor  responded,  'W ho  really  would  love  a  door  mat?' She  went on,  ' At  least  I  wouldn't  want  to  be  loved  by  the  kind  of  person who'd love a door mat!'\nThus,  though  these  words  convey  nothing  of  the  self  she  might be  moving  toward,  the  weariness  and  disdain  in  both  her  voice  and her  statement  make  it  clear  that  she  is  moving  away  from  a  self which has to be good, which has to be submissive.\nCuriously enough a  number of individuals  find  that they  have  felt compelled  to  regard  themselves  as  bad, and  it  is  this concept  of themselves  that  they  find  they  are  moving  away  from. One  young man shows  very  clearly such  a  movement.  He  says:  ' I  don't  know how  I  got  this  impression  that  being  ashamed  of  myself  was  such an  appropriate  way  to  feel.  .  .  .  Being  ashamed  of  me  was  the  way\nI  just had to b e .. .   .  There  was a world  where  being ashamed  of  my­ self  was  the  best  way  to  feel.  . . .   If  you  are  something  which  is disapproved  of very  much,  then  I  guess  the  only  way  you  can  have any  kind  of  self-respect  is  to  be  ashamed  of  that  part  of  you  which isn't approved o f .. . .\n' But now I'm adamantly  refusing to  do  things  from  the  old  view­ point.  .  .  .  It's  as  if  I'm  convinced  that  someone  said,  'The  way  you will  have  to be  is to be ashamed of yourself -  so  he that w ay!' And I  accepted it for a  long,  long time, saying  'O K ,  that's  m e!' And now I'm  standing  up  against  that  somebody,  saying,  'I  don't  care  what you say.  I'm  not  going  to  feel  ashamed  of  m yself!' ' Obviously  he is abandoning the concept of himself as shameful and bad.",

In  our  current  industrial  culture,  for  example, as  W hyte  has  forcefully  pointed  out  in  his  recent  book  (7),  there are  enormous  pressures  to  become  the  characteristics  which  are  ex­ pected of the  ' organization man.' Thus one should  be  fully a mem­ ber of the  group,  should  subordinate  his  individuality  to  fit  into  the group needs, should become  ' the  well-rounded  man  who  can  handle well-rounded men.'\nIn  a newly  completed  study  of  student  values  in  this  country Jacob  summarizes  his  findings  by  saying,  'The  main  overall  effect of  higher  education  upon  student  values  is  to  bring  about  general acceptance  of  a  body  of  standards  and  attitudes  characteristic  of collegebred  men  and  women  in  the  American  community.  .  .  .  The impact  of  the  college  experience  is  . . .   to  socialize  the  individual, to  refine, polish,  or  'shape  up'  his  values  so  that  he  can  fit  com­ fortably into the ranks of American college alumni.'  (1, p. 6)\nOver  against  these pressures  for  conformity, I find that  when clients  are  free  to  be  any  w ay  they  wish,  they  tend  to  resent  and  to question  the  tendency  of the organization,  the  college  or  the  culture to  mould  them  to  any  given  form. One  of  my  clients  says  with considerable  heat: ' I've been  so  long  trying  to  live according  to what  was meaningful  to  other people,  and what made  no  sense  at all to me, really.  I somehow felt so much more than that, at some  level.'\n170 A P h il o s o p h y o f P e r s o n s So  he. like others,  tends  to  move away  from  being  what  is  ex­ pected.",

So  one  professional  man,  looking  back  at  some of  the  process  he  has  been  through, writes, toward  the end of therapy: ' I finally  felt  that  I simply  had  to  begin doing  what  I VJ71  ted  to  do.  not  what  I  thought  1   should  do,  and regardless  of what  other  people  feel  1   should  do. This  is  a  complete  reversal  of my whole life.  I've alwa\\*s felt I  had  to do  things because  they were cxpccted  of  me,  or  more  important,  to  make  people  like  me.

So  thanks  for  your  part  in  helping  me  to  re­ discover Shakespeare's - 'T o thine own self be true.' '\nSo  one  may  say  that  in  a  somewhat  negative  way,  clients  define their goal,  their  purpose,  by  discovering,  in  the  freedom  and  safety of an  understanding  relationship, some  of  the  directions  they  do  not wish  to move.  They prefer not to  hide  themselves  and  their feelings from themselves, or even from some significant others.  They do not wish  to  be  what  they  ' ought*'  to  be,  whether  that  imperative  is  set by  parents,  or  by  the  culture,  whether  it  is  defined  positively  or negatively. They  do  not  wish  to  mould  themselves  and  their  be­ havior into  a form which would be  merely  pleasing to  others. They do  not,  in  other  words,  choose  to  be  anything  which  is  artificial, anything  which  is  imposed,  anything  which  is  defined  from  with­ out. They  realize  that  they  do  not  value  such  purposes  or  goals, even  though  they  may  have  lived  by  them  all  their  lives  up  to  this point.",

By this  I\nmean that  gradually  he  chooses  the  goals toward  which  he  wants  to move.  He becomes  responsible  for  himself. He  decides w hat activi­ ties  and  wr ays  of  behaving  have  meaning  for  him,  and  what  do  not. I think  this  tendency  toward  self-direction  is  amply  illustrated  in the examples I have given.\nI would  not  want  to  give  the  impression  that  my  clients  move blithely or  confidently  in  this  direction. No  indeed. Freedom to  be oneself  is a frighteningly  responsible  freedom,  and an individual moves toward it cautiously,  fearfully,  and with almost no confidence at first.\nNor  would  I  want  to  give  the  impression  that  he  ahvays  makes sound  choices. To  be responsibly self-directing means  that one chooses - and  then  learns  from  the  consequences. So  clients  find this  a  sobering  but  exciting  kind  of  experience. As  one  client  says - 'I  feel  frightened,  and  vulnerable,  and  cut  loose  from  support, but I  also feel a sort of surging up  or  force  or  strength  in  me.' This is a  common kind  of reaction  as  the  client  takes  over  the  self-direc­ tion of his o w ti  life and behavior.",

        "text": "The  second  observation  is  difficult  to  make,  because  wr e  do  not have  good  w'ords  for  it. Clients  seem  to  move  toward  more  openly being  a  process,  a  fluidity,  a  changing. They  are  not  disturbed  to find  that  they  are  not  the  same  from  day  to  day,  that  they  do  not always  hold  the  same  feelings  toward  a  given  experience  or  person, that  they  are  not  always  consistent. They  are  in  flux, and  seem more  content  to  continue  in  this  flowing  current. The  striving  for conclusions and  end  states seems  to  diminish.\nOne  client  says,  'Things  are  sure  changing,  boy,  when  I  can't even  predict  my  own  behavior  in  here  anymore. It  was  something I  was able to do  before. Now I  don't know what I'll say next.  Man, it's quite  a  feeling.  .  . .   I'm  just  surprised  I  even  said  these  things.  .  .  . I  see  something  newr   every  time. It's  an  adventure,  that's  wfhat  it  is - into the unknow n___ I'm beginning to enjoy this now, I'm  joyful about  it,  even  about  all  these  old  negative  things.'  He  is  beginning to  appreciate  himself  as  a  fluid  process,  at  first  in  the  therapy  hour, but  later  he  will  find  this  true  in  his  life. I cannot  help  but  be  re­\nminded  of  Kierkegaard's  description  of  the  individual  who  really exists. ' An  existing  individual  is  constantly  in  process  of  becoming, . . . and  translates  all  his  thinking  into  terms  of  process. It  is  with (him)  . . .   as  it  is  with  a  w riter  and  his  style;  for  he  only  has  a  style who  never  has  anything  finished,  but 'moves  the waters of the language' every time  he begins, so  that  the  most common  expression comes  into  being  for  him  with  the  freshness  of  a  new  birth.' (2, p.  79)  I  find  this  catches  excellently  the  direction  in  which  clients move,  toward  being  a  process  of  potentialities  being  born,  rather than being or becoming some fixed goal.",

        "text": "It  also involves  being  a  complexity  of  process. Perhaps  an  il­ lustration  will  help  here. One  of  our  counselors,  who  has  himself been much helped by psychotherapy, recently came to me to discuss his  relationship  with  a  very  difficult  and disturbed  client. It in­ terested  me  that  he  did  not  wish  to  discuss  the  clicnt,  except  in  the briefest  terms. Mostly  he  wanted  to  be  sure  that  he  was  clearly aware  of  the  complexity  of  his  own  feelings  in  the  relationship his  warm  feelings  toward  the  clicnt,  his  occasional  frustration  and annoyance,  his  sympathetic  regard  for  the  client's  welfare,  a  degree of  fear  that  the  client  might  become  psychotic,  his  concern  as  to what  others  would  think  if  the  case  did  not  turn  out  well. I re­ alized  that  his  overall  attitude  was  that  if  he  could  be,  quite  openly and  transparently,  all  of  his  complex  and  changing  and  sometimes contradictory  feelings  in  the  relationship,  all  would  go well. If, however,  he  was  only  part  of  his  feelings,  and  partly  fagade  or  de­ fense,  he  was  sure  the  relationship  would  not  be  good. I find  that this  desire  to  be  all  of  oneself  in each  moment - all  the  richness and  complexity,  with  nothing  hidden  from  oneself,  and nothing feared  in  oneself - this is a common  desire  in those who  have seemed  to  show  much  movement  in  therapy. I do  not  need  to  say that this is a difficult, and in  its absolute sense an  impossible goal.  Yet one of the most evident trends in clients is to move toward becoming all of  the complexity  of  one's  changing  self in each  significant moment.\nT oward  O pf.n n fss to  F.xpkrikncf.\n' T o be  that  self  which  one  truly  is' involves  still other  com­ ponents. One  which  has  perhaps  been  implied  already  is  that  the individual  moves  toward  living  in  an  open,  friendly,  close  relation­ ship  to  his  own  experience. This  does  not  occur  easily. Often  as the  client  senses  some  new  facet  o f  himself,  he  initially  rejects  it. Only  as  he  experiences  such  a  hitherto  denied  aspect  of  himself  in an acceptant climate can  he tentatively  accept it  as  a  part of  himself. As one client says with some shock after experiencing the  dependent, small boy  aspect  of himself, ' That's an emotion  I've never  felt clearly - one  that  I've  never  been!' He  cannot  tolerate  the  ex­ perience  of  his  childish  feelings. But  gradually  he  comes  to  accept and  embrace  them  as  a  part  of  himself,  to  live  close  to  them  and  in them when they occur.\nAnother  young  man,  with  a  very  serious  stuttering  problem,  lets himself be open to  some  of his  buried  feelings  toward  the end  of his therapy.  He  says,  'Boy,  it  was  a  terrible  fight. I  never  realized  it. I  guess  it  was  too  painful  to  reach  that  height. I  mean  I'm  just  be­ ginning  to  feel  it  now. Oh,  the  terrible  pain.  . . .   It  was  terrible  to talk. I mean  I  wanted  to  talk  and  then  I  didn't  want  to.  .  .  .  I'm feeling - I  think  I  kn ow it's  just  plain  strain - terrible  strain stress, that's  the  word,  just  so  much stress  I've  been  feeling. I'm  just beginning to feel it  now  after all these  years  of  it.  .  .  .  it's  terrible. I can  hardly  get  my  breath  now  too,  I'm  just  all  choked  up  inside,  all tight  inside.  . . .   I  just  feel  like  I'm  crushed. {He  begins  to  cry.) I never realized  that, I  never knew  that.'  (6)  Here  he  is opening him­ self to internal  feelings which  are  clearly  not new  to  him,  but  which up to this time,  he  has never been able fully to experience. Now that he  can  permit  himself to  experience  them,  he  will  find  them less  ter­ rible,  and  he  will  be  able  to  live  closer  to  his  own  experiencing.\nGradually  clients  learn  that  experiencing  is  a  friendly  resource, not a frightening enemy.  Thus I  think of one client who, toward the close  of  therapy,  when  puzzled  about  an  issue,  would  put  his  head in  his  hands  and  say,  ' N ow   what  is  it  I'm  feeling? I want  to  get next to  it. I  want to  learn  what it  is.' Then he would  wait,  quietly\nand  patiently,  until  he  could  discern  the  exact  flavor  of  the  feelings occurring in  him. Often  I  sense  that  the  client  is  trying  to  listen  to himself,  is  trying to  hear the messages and  meanings  which  are being communicated  by  his own  physiological  reactions. No  longer  is  he so  fearful  of  what  he  may  find. He  comes  to  realize  that  his  own inner  reactions  and  experiences,  the  messages  of  his  senses  and  his viscera,  are  friendly. He  comes  to  want  to  be  close  to  his  inner sources of information rather than closing them off.\nMaslow,  in  his  study  of  what  he  calls  self-actualizing  people,  has noted  this  same  characteristic. Speaking  of  these  people,  he  says, ' Their  ease  of  penetration  to  reality,  their  closer  approach  to  an animal-like or  child-like acceptance  and  spontaneity  imply  a  su­ perior awareness  of  their  own  impulses,  their  own  desires,  opinions, and subjective reactions in general.'  (4, p.  210)\nThis  greater openness to  what  goes on  within  is associated  with  a similar openness  to experiences of  external reality. Maslow might be speaking  of  clients I have  known  when  he  says, 'self-actualized people  have  a  wonderful  capacity  to  appreciate  again  and again, freshly and  naively,  the  basic goods  of  life  with  awe,  pleasure,  won­ der,  and  even  ecstasy,  however  stale  these  experiences  may  be  for other people.'  (4, p. 214)",

A s  a  client  moves  toward  being  able  to  accept  his  own  experience, he  also  moves  toward  the  acceptance  of  the  experience  of  others. He  values  and  appreciates  both  his  own experience  and  that  of others  for  what  it  is. To  quote  Maslow  again  regarding  his  selfactualizing individuals:  ' One does not complain  about water because it  is  wet,  nor  about  rocks  because  they  are  hard.  . . .   A s  the  child looks  out  upon  the  world  with  wide,  uncritical  and  innocent  eyes, simply noting and observing what is the case, without either arguing the  matter  or  demanding  that  it  be  otherwise,  so  does the selfactualizing  person  look  upon  human  nature  both  in  himself  and  in others.' (4, p. 207) This  acceptant  attitude  toward  that  which exists, I find developing in clients in therapy.",

Watching  my  clients,  I have  com e  to  a  much better  understanding  o f  creative people. El Greco,  for  example, must have realized  as he looked at some  of his early work,  that 'good artists  do  not  paint  like  that.' But  som ehow  he  trusted  his  ow n experiencing of life,  the  process o f himself,  sufficiently  that  he  could go  on  expressing  his  ow n  unique  perceptions. It  was  as  though  he could  say,  'G ood  artists  do  not  paint  like  this,  but I paint  like  this.' Or  to  m ove  to  another  field,  Ernest  H em ingw ay  was  surely  aware that 'good writers do not write like this.'  But fortunately  he  m oved toward  being  H em ingway,  being  himself,  rather  than  toward  some one  else's  conception  o f  a  good  writer. Einstein  seems  to  have  been unusually  oblivious to  the  fact that  good  physicists  did  not  think  his kind  o f  thoughts. Rather  than  drawing  back  because  o f  his  inade­ quate  academic  preparation  in  physics, he simply  moved  toward being  Einstein,  toward  thinking  his  ow n  thoughts,  toward  being  as truly  and  deeply  himself  as  he  could. This  is  not  a  phenomenon which occurs only in the  artist  or  the  genius. Time and  again  in  m y clients, I have  seen  simple  people  becom e  significant  and  creative in their  ow n  spheres, as they  have  developed  more  trust  of  the processes  going  on  w ithin  themselves,  and  have  dared  to  feel  their own feelings,  live  b y  values w hich  they  discover  w ithin,  and express themselves in their ow n  unique  ways.",

It  seems  to  mean  that  the  individual moves toward  being,  knowingly and  acceptingly,  the  process which he  inwardly and  actually is. He  moves  away from  being what he is not,  from  being  a  fa5ade. He  is  not  trying  to  be  more  than  he  is, with  the  attendant  feelings  of  insecurity  or  bombastic  defensive­ ness.  He is not trying to be less than he is,  with the attendant feelings of guilt or self-depreciation.  He is increasingly listening to  the  deep­\nest  recesses  of  his  physiological  and  emotional  being,  and  finds  him­ self increasingly willing to be, with  greater accuracy  and  depth,  that self  which  he  most  truly  is. One  client,  as  he  begins  to  sense  the direction he is  taking, asks himself wonderingly and with incredulity in  one  interview,  ' You  mean  if  I'd  really  be  what  I  feel  like  being, that  that  would  be  all  right?' His  own  further  experience,  and  that of  many  another  client,  tends  toward  an  affirmative  answer. To  be what  he  truly  is,  this  is  the  path  of  life  which  he  appears  to  value most  highly,  when  he  is  free  to  move  in  any  direction. It  is not simply  an intellectual  value  choice,  but seems to  be  the  best  descrip­ tion  of  the groping,  tentative, uncertain  behaviors by  which  he moves  exploringly toward  what  he  wants  to  be.",

In­ deed it is the person who is denying his feelings and his reactions who is the person who tends to come for therapy.  He has, often for years, been  trying  to  change,  but  finds  himself  fixed  in  these  behaviors which  he  dislikes. It  is  only  as  he  can  become  more  of  himself,  can be more of what  he  has  denied  in  himself,  that  there  is  any  prospect of  change.",

        "text": "An  even  more  common  reaction  to  the  path  of  life  I  have  been describing is that to be what one  truly is would mean  to  be bad,  evil, uncontrolled,  destructive. It  would  mean  to  unleash  some  kind  of a monster on  the  world. This  is  a  view  which  is  very  well  known  to me,  since  I  meet  it  in  almost  every  client. ' I f  I dare  to  let  the  feel­ ings  flow  which  are  dammed  up  within  me,  if  by  some  chance  I should  live  in  those  feelings,  then  this  would  be  catastrophe.' This is the attitude, spoken or unspoken, of nearly every client as he moves into  the  experiencing  of  the  unknown  aspects  of  himself. But  the whole  course  of  his  experience  in  therapy  contradicts  these  fears. He  finds  that  gradually  he  can  be  his  anger,  when  anger  is  his  real reaction,  but  that  such  accepted  or  transparent  anger  is not  destruc­ tive. He  finds  that  he  can  be  his  fear,  but  that  knowingly  to  be  his fear  does  not  dissolve  him. He  finds  that he  can  be  self-pitying,  and it  is  not  ' bad.' He can  feel  and  be  his  sexual  feelings,  or  his  ' lazy' feelings,  or  his  hostile  feelings,  and  the  roof  of  the  world  does  not fall  in. The  reason  seems  to  be  that  the  more  he  is  able  to  permit these  feelings  to  flow  and  to  be  in  him,  the  more  they  take  their appropriate  place  in  a  total  harmony  of  his  feelings. He  discovers that  he  has  other  feelings  with  which  these  mingle  and  find  a  bal­ ance.  He feels loving and tender and considerate and cooperative,  as well  as  hostile  or  lustful  or  angry. He  feels  interest  and  zest  and curiosity,  as  well  as  laziness  or  apathy. He  feels  courageous  and venturesome,  as  well  as  fearful. His  feelings,  when  he  lives  closely and  acceptingly  with  their  complexity,  operate  in  a  constructive harmony  rather  than  sweeping  him  into  some  uncontrollably  evil path.\nSometimes  people  express  this  concern  by  saying  that  if  an  in­ dividual were  to  be  what he  truly  is,  he  would  be  releasing the beast in  himself. I  feel somewhat amused by this, because  I think we might take  a  closcr  look  at  the  beasts. The  lion  is  often  a  symbol  of  the ' ravening  beast.' But  what  about  him? Unless  he  has  been  very much  warped  by  contact  with  humans,  he  has  a  number  of  the qualities  I have  been  describing. To  be  sure,  he  kills  when  he  is\nhungry,  but  he  does  not  go  on  a  wild  rampage  of  killing,  nor  does he  overfeed  himself.  He keeps  his  handsome  figure better than some of us. He is helpless and  dependent  in  his puppyhood,  but  he moves from  that  to  independence. He  does  not  cling  to  dependence. He is  selfish  and  self-centered  in  infancy,  but  in  adulthood  he  shows  a reasonable  degree  of  cooperativeness,  and  feeds,  cares  for,  and  pro­ tects  his  young. He  satisfies  his  sexual desires,  but  this  does  not mean that he goes on wild and  lustful  orgies. His various  tendencies and  urges  have  a  harmony  within  him. He  is,  in  some  basic  sense, a  constructive and trustworthy member of the species  felis leo.  And what  I  am  trying  to  suggest  is  that  when  one  is  truly  and  deeply  a unique  member  of  the  human  species,  this  is  not  something  which should excite horror.  It means instead that  one lives fully and openly the  complex  process  of  being  one  of  the  most  widely  sensitive,  re­ sponsive, and creative creatures on this planet.  Fully to be one's own uniqueness  as  a  human  being,  is  not,  in  my  experience,  a  process which would be labeled bad.  More appropriate words might be that it is a  positive,  or  a  constructive,  or  a  realistic,  or  a  trustworthy process.",

        "text": "Let me  turn  for  a  moment  to  some  of  the  social  implications  of the  path  of  life  I have  attempted  to  describe. I have  presented  it as  a  direction  which  seems  to  have  great  meaning  for  individuals. Docs  it  have,  could  it  have,  any  meaning  or  significance  for  groups or  organizations? Would  it  be  a  direction  which  might  usefully  be chosen by  a  labor  union,  a  church  group,  an  industrial  corporation, a  university,  a  nation? To  me  it  seems  that  this  might  be  possible. Let us  take  a  look,  for example,  at  the  conduct  of  our  own  country in its  foreign affairs. By and  large  we  find,  if  we  listen  to  the  state­ ments  of  our  leaders  during  the  past  several  years,  and  read  their documents,  that  our  diplomacy  is  always  based  upon  high  moral purposes;  that  it  is  always  consistent  with  the  policies  we  have  fol­ lowed  previously;  that  it  involves  no  selfish  desires;  and  that  it  has never  been  mistaken  in  its  judgments  and  choices. I  think  perhaps\nyou  will  agree  with  me  that  if  we  heard  an  individual  speaking  in these  terms  we  would  recognize  at  once  that  this  must  be  a  fagade, that  such  statements  could  not  possibly  represent  the  real  process going  on  within  himself.\nSuppose  we  speculate  for  a  moment  as  to  how  we,  as  a  nation, might present ourselves in our foreign diplomacy if we were openly, knowingly, and acceptingly being what we truly are.  I do not know precisely what we are, but I suspect that if  we were trying to express ourselves as we are,  then our communications with foreign  countries would  contain  elements of this sort.\nWe  as  a  nation  are  slowly  realizing  our  enormous  strength,  and the  power  and  responsibility  which  go  with  that  strength.\nWe  are  moving,  somewhat  ignorantly  and  clumsily,  toward  ac­ cepting a  position  of  responsible  world  leadership.\nWe make many  mistakes.  W e  are  often  inconsistent.\nWe are far from perfect.\nWe are deeply frightened  by the  strength  of Communism,  a view of life different from  our  own.\nWe  feel  extremely  competitive  toward  Communism,  and  we  are angry  and  humiliated  when  the  Russians  surpass  us  in  any  field.\nWe have  some  very  selfish  foreign  interests,  such  as  in  the  oil  in the  Middle  East.\nOn  the  other  hand,  we  have  no  desire  to  hold  dominion  over peoples.\nWe have complex and  contradictory  feelings  toward the  freedom and  independence  and  self-determination  of  individuals  and  coun­ tries: we  desire  these  and  are  proud  of  the  past  support  we  have given  to  such  tendencies,  and  yet  we  are  often  frightened  by  what they  may  mean.\nWe tend  to  value  and  respect  the  dignity  and  worth  of  each  in­ dividual, yet when we are frightened, we move away from this direc­ tion.\nSuppose  we  presented  ourselves  in some  such  fashion,  openly  and transparently,  in  our  foreign  relations. We would  be  attempting  to be  the  nation  which  we  truly  are,  in  all  our  complexity  and  even contradictoriness. What  would  be  the  results? To  me  the  results would be similar to the experiences of a client when  he  is more truly\n180\nthat  which  he  is. Let  us  look  at  some  of  the  probable  outcomes. We  would  be  much  more  comfortable,  because  we  would  have nothing  to  hide.\nWe  could  focus  on  the  problem  at  hand,  rather  than  spending our  energies  to  prove  that  we  are  moral  or  consistent.\nWe could  use  all  of  our  creative  imagination  in  solving  the  prob­ lem,  rather  than  in  defending  ourselves.\nWe could openly advance both  our selfish  interests,  and  our sym­ pathetic  concern  for  others,  and  let  these  conflicting  desires  find the  balance  which  is  acceptable to  us  as  a  people.\nWe could  freely  changc  and  grow  in  our  leadership  position,  be­ cause  we  would  not  be  bound  by  rigid  concepts  of  what  we  have been,  must  be,  ought  to  be.\nWe  would  find  that  we  were  much  less  feared,  because  others would be less inclined to suspect what lies behind the fa£ade.\nWe would,  by  our  own  openness,  tend  to  bring  forth  openness and  realism  on  the  part  of  others.\nWe would  tend  to  work  out  the  solutions  of  world  problems  on the  basis  of  the  real  issues  involved, rather  than  in  terms  of  the facades  being  worn  by  the  negotiating  parties.\nIn  short  what  I  am  suggesting  by  this  fantasied  example  is  that nations  and  organizations  might  discover,  as  have  individuals,  that it  is  a  richly  rewarding  experience  to  be  what  one  deeply  is. I am suggesting  that  this  view  contains  the  seeds  of  a  philosophical  ap­ proach  to  all  of  life,  that  it  is  more  than  a  trend  observed  in  the experience  of  clients.",

        "text": "I  began  this  talk  with  the  question  each  individual  asks  of  himself - what  is  the  goal,  the  purpose,  of  my  life? I have  tried  to  tell you  what  I  have  learned  from  m y  clients,  who  in  the  therapeutic relationship,  with  its  freedom  from  threat  and  freedom  of  choice, exemplify  in  their  lives  a  commonality  of  direction  and  goal.\nI  have pointed  out that they tend to move away from self-conceal-\nnient,  away  from  being  the  expectations  of  others. The  character­ istic  movement,  I  have  said,  is  for  the  client  to  permit  himself  freely to  be  the  changing,  fluid,  process  which  he  is. He  moves  also  to­ ward a friendly openness to  what  is  going on within  him - learning to  listen  sensitively  to  himself. This  means  that  he  is  increasingly  a harmony  of  complex  sensings  and  reactions,  rather  than  being  the clarity  and  simplicity  of  rigidity. It  means  that  as  he  moves  toward acceptance of the  'is-ness' of himself,  he  accepts others  increasingly in  the  same  listening,  understanding  way. He  trusts  and  values  the complex  inner  processes  of  himself,  as  they  emerge  toward  expres­ sion. He  is  creatively  realistic,  and  realistically  creative. He  finds that  to  be  this  process  in  himself  is  to  maximize  the  rate  of  change and  growth  in  himself. He  is  continually  engaged  in  discovering that  to  be  all  of  himself  in  this  fluid  sense  is  not  synonymous  with being  evil  or  uncontrolled. It  is  instead  to  feel  a  growing  pride  in being  a  sensitive,  open,  realistic,  inner-directed  member  of  the  hu­ man species, adapting with  courage and imagination to the complexi­ ties  of  the  changing  situation. It  means  taking  continual  steps  to­ ward  being,  in  awareness  and  in  expression,  that  which  is  congruent with  one's  total  organismic  reactions. To  use  Kierkegaard's  more aesthetically  satisfying  terms,  it  means  ' to  be  that  self  which  one truly  is.' I trust  I have  made  it  evident  that  this  is  not  an  easy direction  to  move,  nor  one  which  is  ever  completed. It  is  a con­ tinuing  way  of  life.\nIn  trying to  explore  the  limits of such  a  concept,  I  have  suggested that this  direction  is  not a  way which is  necessarily  limited  to  clients in  therapy,  nor  to  individuals  seeking  to  find  a  purpose  in  life. It would seem to make the same kind of sense for a group, an organiza­ tion, or a nation, and would seem to have the same  kind of rewarding concomitants.\nI recognize  quite  clearly  that  this  pathway  of  life  w'hich  I  have outlined  is  a  value  choice  which  is  decidedly  at  variance  wT ith  the goals usually chosen or behaviorally  followed.  Yet because  it springs from  individuals  who  have  more  than  the  usual  freedom  to  choose, and  because  it  seems  to  express  a  unified  trend  in  these  individuals, I  offer  it  to  you  for  your  consideration.",

It  was  an  attempt  to  spell  out  the  picture  of the person who woidd emerge if  therapy  were maximally  successful. 1  was  somewhat  frightened  by  the  fluid,  relativistic,  individualistic person  who  seemed  to  be  the  logical  outcome  of  the  processes  of therapy.  I felt two questions. Was my logic correct?  If correct, was this the sort of person I valued? To give myself opportunity  to mull over these ideas, I had the paper duplicated, and in  the  ensuing years have  distributed  hundreds  of  copies  to  interested  inquirers. As  I became more sure  of the ideas  it  contained,  I submitted  it  to  one  of the  major  psychological  journals. The  editor  wrote  that  he  would publish it, but felt that  it  needed  to  be  cast  in  a much  more  conventio?ial  psychological  framework. He  suggested  many  fundamental changes. This made  me feel  that  it  was probably  not  acceptable  to psychologists  in  the  form  in  which  I  had  written  it,  and  I  dropped the  idea  of  publication. Since  then it  has  continued to  be a  focus  of interest for a  wide  diversity  of people, and  Dr.  Hayakawa  has writ­ ten  an  article  about  the  concept  in  the  journal  of  the  semanticists, ETC.  Consequently  this  was  one  of  the  papers  which  came first  to my mind when I contemplated the present book.\n183\nWhen I  re-read  it  however  1  found  that  in  the  intervening  years many  of  its  most  central  themes  and  ideas  had  been  absorbed,  and perhaps  better  expressed,  in  other  papers  I  have  included. So,  with some  reluctance  I  have  again  put  it  aside,  and  present  here  instead  a paper  on  my  view  of  the  good  life,  a  paper  which  was  based  upon ' The  Fully  Functioning Person,' and which  expresses, 1  believe,  the essential  aspects  of  that  paper  in  briefer  and  viore  readable  form. My  only  concession  to the  past is  to give  the  chapter  heading a sub­ title.\n&\nM y  views  regarding  the  meaning  of  the  good  life  are  largely based  upon  my  experience  in  working  with  people  in  the very  close  and  intimate  relationship  which  is  called  psychotherapy. These  views  thus  have  an  empirical  or  experiential  foundation,  as contrasted  perhaps  with  a  scholarly  or  philosophical  foundation. I have learned what the good life seems to be by observing and partici­ pating  in  the  struggle  of  disturbed  and  troubled  people  to  achieve that  life.\nI  should  make  it  clear  from  the  outset  that  this  experience  I  have gained  comes  from  the  vantage  point  of  a  particular  orientation  to psychotherapy  which  has  developed  over  the  years. Quite  possibly all  psychotherapy  is  basically  similar,  but since  I  am  less  sure  of that than  I  once  was,  I  wish  to  make  it  clear  that  my  therapeutic  experi­ ence has been along the  lines that seem  to me most effective, the type of  therapy termed  'client-centered.'\nLet  me  attempt  to give  a very  brief  description  of  what  this therapy  would  be  like  if  it  were  in  every  respect  optimal,  since  I feel  I have  learned  most  about  the  good  life  from  therapeutic  ex­ periences in which a great deal of movement occurred.  If the therapy were optimal, intensive  as  well as  extensive,  then  it would  mean  that the  therapist  has  been  able  to  enter  into  an  intensely  personal  and subjective  relationship  with  the  client -  relating  not  as  a  scientist to  an  object  of  study,  not  as  a  physician  expecting  to  diagnose  and\ncurc,  but  as  a  person  to  a  person. It  would  mean  that  the  therapist feels  this  clicnt  to  be  a  person  of  unconditional  self-worth:  of  value no matter what his condition,  his  behavior,  or his  feelings. It  would mean  that the therapist is genuine, hiding behind no defensive fagadc,  but  meeting  the  clicnt  with  the  feelings  which  organically he  is  experiencing. It  would  mean  that  the  therapist  is  able  to  let himself  go  in  understanding  this  client;  that  no  inner  barriers  keep him  from  sensing  what  it  feels  like  to  be  the  clicnt  at  each  moment of  the  relationship;  and  that  he  can  convey  something  of  his  empathic  understanding  to  the  clicnt. It  means  that  the  therapist  has been  comfortable  in  entering  this  relationship  fully,  without  know­ ing cognitively  where  it  will  lead,  satisfied  with  providing  a  climate which  will  permit  the  clicnt  the utmost  freedom  to  become  himself.\nFor  the  client,  this  optimal  therapy  would  mean  an  exploration of increasingly  strange  and unknown and  dangerous  feelings in  him­ self,  the  exploration  proving  possible  only  because  he  is  gradually realizing  that  he  is  acccptcd  unconditionally. Thus  he  bccomcs  ac­ quainted with elements of his experience which  have in  the  past been denied to awareness as too threatening, too damaging to the structure of the self. He  finds  himself  experiencing  these  feelings  fully,  com­ pletely,  in  the  relationship,  so  that  for  the  moment  he  is  his  fear,  or his  anger,  or  his  tenderness,  or  his  strength. And  as  he  lives  these widely  varied  feelings,  in  all  their  degrees  of  intensity,  he  discovers that he has experienced himself, that he  is all  these  feelings. He finds his  behavior changing in  constructive  fashion  in  accordance  with  his newly  experienced  self. He  approaches  the  realization  that  he  no longer  needs  to  fear  what  experience  may  hold,  but  can  welcome it  freely  as  a  part  of  his  changing  and  developing  self.\nThis  is  a  thumbnail  sketch  of what  client-centered  therapy  comes close  to,  when  it  is  at  its  optimum. I  give  it  here  simply  as  a  brief picture of the context in which  I  have  formed my  views  of the good life.",

It  seems  to  me  that  the  good  life  is  not  any  fixed  state.\nIt  is  not, in  my  estimation,  a  state  of  virtue,  or  contentment, or nirvana,  or  happiness. It  is  not  a  condition  in  which  the  individual is  adjusted,  or  fulfilled,  or  actualized. To  use  psychological  terms, it  is  not  a  state  o f  drive-reduction,  or  tension-reduction,  or  homeo­ stasis.\nI believe  that  all  of  these  terms  have  been  used  in  ways  which imply that if one  or  several  of  these  states  is  achieved,  then  the  goal of  life  has  been  achieved. Certainly,  for  many  people  happiness,  or adjustment,  are  seen  as  states  of  being  which  are  synonymous  with the  good  life. And  social  scientists  have  frequently  spoken  of  the reduction  of  tension,  or  the  achievement  of  homeostasis  or  equilib­ rium  as  if  these  states  constituted  the  goal  of  the  process  of  living. So  it  is  with a certain  amount  of  surprise  and  concern  that  I realize  that  my  experience  supports  none  of  these  definitions. If  I focus  on  the  experience  of  those  individuals  who  seem  to  have  evi­ denced  the  greatest degree  of movement during the therapeutic rela­ tionship,  and who,  in the  years  following this  relationship,  appear  to have made and to be making real progress  toward the good life, then it  seems  to  me  that  they  are  not  adequately  described  at  all  by  any of  these  terms  which  refer  to  fixed  states  of  being. I  believe  they would  consider  themselves  insulted  if  they  were  described  as  ' ad­ justed,'  and  they  would  regard  it  as  false  if  they  were  described  as 'happy'  or  'contented,'  or  even  ' actualized.' As  I have  known them  I  would  regard  it as  most  inaccurate  to  say  that  all  their  drive tensions have been reduced, or that they are in a state of homeostasis. So  I  am  forced  to  ask  myself  whether  there  is  any  way  in  which I  can  generalize  about  their  situation,  any  definition  which  I  can give  of  the  good  life  which  would  seem  to  fit  the  facts  as  I  have observed them.  I  find  this  not at  all  easy,  and  what  follows  is  stated very  tentatively.",

        "text": "In the first place, the process seems  to involve an increasing openness  to  experience. This  phrase  has  come  to  have  more  and more meaning for me.  It is  the  polar opposite  of  defensiveness. De­ fensiveness  I  have  described  in  the  past  as  being  the  organism's  re­ sponse  to  experiences  which  are  perceived  or  anticipated  as  threat­ ening, as incongment with the individual's existing picture  of himself, or  of  himself  in  relationship  to  the  world. These  threatening  ex­ periences  are  temporarily  rendered  harmless  by  being  distorted  in awareness,  or being denied to  awareness.  I  quite  literally  cannot see, with accuracy, those  experiences, feelings,  reactions in myself which are  significantly  at  variance  with the  picture  of  myself  which  I already possess.  A large part of the  process  of therapy  is the  contin­ uing  discovery  by  the  client  that  he  is  experiencing  feelings  and attitudes which heretofore he has not been able to be aware of, which he has not been able to ' own' as being a part of himself.\nIf  a  person  could  be  fully  open  to  his  experience,  however,  every stimulus - whether  originating  within  the  organism  or  in  the  en-\n188\nvironmcnt - would  be  freely  relayed  through  the  nervous  system without  being distorted  by  any  defensive  mechanism. There  would be no need of the mechanism of 'subception' whereby  the organism is  forewarned  of any experience threatening to the self.  On  the con­ trary,  whether  the  stimulus  was  the  impact  of  a  configuration  of form,  color,  or  sound  in  the  environment  on  the  sensory  nerves, or  a  memory  trace  from  the  past,  or  a  visceral  sensation  of  fear  or pleasure  or  disgust,  the  person  would  be  ' living'  it,  would  have  it completely available to awareness.\nThus,  one  aspect  of  this  process  which  I  am  naming  ' the  good life'  appears  to  be  a  movement  away  from  the pole  of  defensiveness toward  the  pole  of  openness  to  experience. The  individual  is  be­ coming more able to listen to himself,  to experience what is going on within  himself. He is  more  open to  his  feelings  of  fear  and  discour­ agement  and  pain. He  is  also  more  open  to  his  feelings  of  courage, and  tenderness,  and  awe. He  is  free  to  live  his  feelings  subjectively, as they exist in  him, and also free to be aware of these feelings.  He is more  able  fully  to  live  the  experiences  of  his  organism  rather  than shutting them out of awareness.",

        "text": "A  second  characteristic  of  the  process  which  for  me  is  the  good life,  is  that  it  involves  an  increasing  tendency  to  live  fully  in  each moment.  This  is  a  thought which  can  easily  be  misunderstood,  and which  is  perhaps  somewhat vague  in  my  own  thinking. Let  me  try to  explain  what  I  mean.\nI believe  it  would  be  evident  that  for  the  person  who  was  fully open  to  his  new  experience,  completely  without  defensiveness,  each moment  would  be  new. The  complex  configuration  of  inner  and outer  stimuli  which  exists  in  this  moment  has  never  existed  before in  just  this  fashion. Consequently  such  a  person  would  realize  that 'What I  will  be  in  the  next  moment,  and  what  I  will  do,  grows  out of that moment, and cannot be predicted in advance either by  me or by  others.' Not infrequently  we  find  clients  expressing  exactly  this sort of feeling.\nOne  way  of  expressing  the  fluidity  which  is  present  in  such  ex­ istential  living  is  to  say  that  the  self  and  personality  emerge  from\nexperience,  rather  than  experience  being  translated  or  twisted  to  fit preconceived self-structure.  It means that one  becomes  a  participant in  and  an  observer of the  ongoing  process  of  organismic  experience, rather than being in control of it.\nSuch  living  in  the  moment  means  an  absence  of  rigidity,  of  tight organization,  of the  imposition  of structure  on  experience. It  means instead a maximum  of  adaptability, a discovery of structure in experience,  a  flowing,  changing  organization  of self and  personality.\nIt  is  this  tendency  toward  existential  living  which  appears  to  me very evident in  people  who  are  involved  in  the  process  of  the  good life. One might almost say  that  it  is  the  most  essential  quality  of  it. It  involves  discovering  the  structure  of  experience  in  the  process  of living  the  experience. Most  of  us,  on  the  other  hand,  bring  a  pre­ formed  structure  and  evaluation  to  our  experience  and  never  re­ linquish  it,  but  cram  and  twist  the  experience  to  fit  our  preconcep­ tions, annoyed at the fluid qualities which make it so unruly in  fitting our carefully  constructed  pigeonholes.  T o   open  one's  spirit  to  what is  going  on  ?iow,  and  to  discover  in  that  present  process  w hatever structure it appears to have - this to me is one of the qualities  of the good life, the mature life, as I see clients approach it.",

        "text": "Still  another  characteristic  of  the  person  who  is  living  the  process of  the  good  life  appears  to  be  an  increasing  trust  in  his  organism  as a means of arriving at the  most satisfying behavior in each existential situation. Again  let  me  try  to  explain  what  I  mean.\nIn  choosing  what  course  of  action  to  take  in  any  situation,  many people rely upon guiding principles,  upon a code of action laid  down by  some  group  or  institution,  upon  the  judgment  of  others  (from wife and friends to Emily Post), or upon the way they have behaved in some similar  past  situation. Yet as  I  observe  the  clients  whose  ex­ periences  in  living  have  taught  me  so  much,  I  find  that  increasingly such individuals  arc  able  to  trust  their  total  organismic  reaction  to  a new situation because they discover to an ever-increasing degree  that if  they  are  open  to  their  experience,  doing  what  ' feels  right'  proves to  be a  competent and  trustworthy  guide  to  behavior  which  is  truly satisfying.\nAs I  try to  understand the reason  for this,  I  find  myself  following this  line  o f  thought. The person  who  is fully open to  his experience would  have  access  to  all  of  the  available  data  in  the  situation,  on which to base  his behavior; the social  demands,  his own complex and possibly  conflicting needs, his memories  of  similar  situations, his perception  of  the  uniqueness  of  this  situation,  etc.,  etc. The  data would  be  very  complex  indeed. But  he  could  permit  his  total  or­ ganism,  his  consciousness  participating,  to  consider  each  stimulus, need,  and  demand,  its  relative  intensity  and  importance,  and  out  of this  complex weighing and  balancing,  discover  that course  of  action which would come closest to satisfying all  his  needs in  the  situation. An  analogy  which  might  come  close  to  a  description  would  be  to compare this person to a  giant electronic  computing machine.  Since he is open to his experience, all of the data from his sense impressions, from  his  memory,  from  previous  learning,  from  his  visceral  and  in­ ternal  states,  is  fed  into  the  machine. The machine  takes  all  of these multitudinous pulls and  forces  which are  fed  in  as  data,  and  quickly computes the course of action which would be  the most economical vector  of  need  satisfaction  in  this  existential  situation. This  is  the behavior of our hypothetical person.\nThe  defects which  in  most of us make  this  process  untrustworthy are the inclusion  of information  which  does  not  belong  to this present  situation,  or  the  exclusion  of  information  which  does. It  is when memories and previous learnings are fed into  the computations as  if  they  were  this  reality,  and  not  memories  and  learnings,  that erroneous behavioral answers arise.  Or when certain threatening ex­ periences are inhibited from awareness, and hence are withheld  from the  computation  or  fed  into  it  in  distorted  form,  this  too  produces error. But  our  hypothetical  person  would  find  his  organism  thor­ oughly trustworthy,  because all  of the  available  data  would  be  used, and  it  would  be  present  in  accurate  rather  than  distorted  form. Hence  his  behavior would  come  as  close  as  possible  to  satisfying  all his needs - for  enhancement,  for  affiliation  with  others,  and  the like.\nIn  this weighing,  balancing,  and  computation,  his  organism  would not  by  any  means  be  infallible. It  would  always  give  the  best  pos­ sible  answer  for  the  available  data,  but  sometimes  data  would  be\nmissing.  Bccause  of the element of openness to  experience,  however, any  errors,  any  following  of  behavior  which  was  not  satisfying, would  be  quickly  corrected. The  computations,  as  it  were,  would always be in process of being corrected, because they would  be con­ tinually checked in behavior.\nPerhaps you will  not like my  analogy  of an  electronic  computing machine.  Let me return to the clients I  know.  As they become more open  to  all  of  their  experiences,  they  find  it  increasingly  possible  to trust  their  reactions. If  they  ' feel  like'  expressing  anger  they  do  so and  find  that  this  comes  out  satisfactorily,  because  they  are  equally alive  to  all  of  their  other  desires  for  affection,  affiliation,  and  re­ lationship. They are  surprised  at  their  own  intuitive  skill  in  finding behavioral  solutions  to  complex  and  troubling  human  relationships. It  is  only  afterward  that  they  realize  how  surprisingly  trustworthy their  inner  reactions  have  been  in  bringing  about  satisfactory  be­ havior.",

It appears that the  person  who  is  psychologically  free  moves  in  the  direction  of becoming a  more  fully  functioning  person. He  is  more  able  to  live fully in and with each and all of his feelings and reactions.  He makes increasing use  of all  his  organic  equipment  to  sense,  as  accurately  as possible,  the  existential  situation  within  and  without. He  makes  use of all  of  the  information  his  nervous  system  can  thus  supply,  using it  in  awareness,  but  recognizing  that  his  total  organism  may  be,  and often  is,  wiser  than  his  awareness. He  is  more  able  to  permit  his total  organism  to  function  freely  in  all  its  complexity  in  selecting, from  the  multitude  of  possibilities,  that  behavior  which  in  this  mo­ ment of time will be  most generally  and  genuinely  satisfying. He  is able  to  put  more  trust  in  his  organism  in  this  functioning,  not  be­ cause  it  is  infallible,  but  because  he  can  be  fully  open  to  the  conse­ quences  of  each  of  his  actions  and  correct  them  if  they  prove  to  be less than satisfying.\nHe  is  more  able  to  experience  all  of  his  feelings,  and  is  less  afraid of  any  of  his  feelings;  he  is  his  own  sifter  of  evidence,  and  is  more\nopen  to  evidence  from  all  sources;  he  is  completely  engaged  in  the process of being and becoming himself,  and thus discovers that  he is soundly  and  realistically  social;  he lives more  completely  in  this moment, but learns that this is  the  soundest  living for  all  time. He is becoming  a  more  fully  functioning  organism,  and  because  of  the awareness  of  himself  which  flows  freely  in  and  through  his  experi­ ence, he is becoming a more fully functioning person.",

Let  me  endeavor to  spell  out the  way  in  which  this issue  now  appears to me  in  a  new light.\nFor  some  time  I  have  been  perplexed  over  the  living  paradox which exists in psychotherapy between freedom and determinism.  In the  therapeutic  relationship  some  of  the  most  compelling  subjective experiences  are  those  in  which  the  client  feels  within  himself  the power  of  naked  choice. He  is  free - to  become  himself  or  to  hide behind a fagade; to move forward or to  retrogress; to behave in ways which  are  destructive  of  self  and  others,  or  in  ways  which  are  en­ hancing;  quite  literally  free  to  live  or  die,  in  both  the  physiological and psychological meaning of those  terms.  Yet as we enter this field of psychotherapy  with  objective  research  methods,  we  are,  like  any other  scientist,  committed  to  a  complete  determinism. From  this point  of  view  every  thought,  feeling,  and  action  of  the  client  is  de­ termined  by  what  preceded  it. There  can  be  no  such  thing  as  free­ dom.  The  dilemma  I  am  trying  to  describe  is  no  different  than  that found  in  other  fields -  it  is  simply  brought  to  sharper  focus,  and appears more insoluble.",

We  could  say  that  in  the  optimum  of  therapy the  person  rightfully  experiences  the  most  complete  and  absolute freedom.  He wills or chooses to follow  the course of action which is the most economical vector in relationship  to  all  the  internal  and  ex­ ternal  stimuli,  because  it  is  that  behavior  which  will  be  most  deeply satisfying. But  this  is  the  same  course  of action  which  from  another vantage  point may be said  to be  determined  by all  the  factors in  the existential  situation. Let  us  contrast  this  with  the  picture  of  the person  who  is  defensively  organized. He  wills  or  chooses  to  follow a  given  course  of  action,  but  finds  that  he  cannot  behave  in  the fashion  that  he  chooses. He  is  determined  by  the  factors  in  the  ex­ istential situation, but  these factors  include his defensiveness, his denial  or  distortion  of  some  of  the  relevant  data. Hence  it  is  cer­ tain  that  his  behavior  will  be  less  than  fully  satisfying. His behavior is  determined,  but  he  is  not  free  to  make  an  effective  choice. The fully  functioning  person,  on  the  other  hand,  not  only  experiences, but  utilizes, the most  absolute freedom  when  he  spontaneously, freely,  and voluntarily chooses and wills that which is also absolutely determined.\nI  am  not  so  naive  as  to  suppose  that  this  fully  resolves  the  issue between  subjective  and  objective,  between  freedom  and  necessity. Nevertheless it has meaning for me that the  more the  person is living the  good  life,  the  more  he  will  experience  a  freedom  of  choice,  and the  more  his  choices  will be  effectively  implemented in his be­ havior.",

For  me  this  is  an inescapable conclusion from a quarter-century  of experience in psychotherapy. When  we  are  able  to  free  the  individual  from  de­ fensiveness,  so  that  he  is  open  to  the  wide  range  of  his  own  needs, as  well  as  the  wide  range  of  environmental  and  social  demands,  his reactions  may  be  trusted  to  be  positive,  forward-moving,  construc­ tive. We do  not  need  to  ask  who  will  socialize  him,  for  one  of  his own deepest  needs  is  for  affiliation  and  communication  with  others. As he becomes more fully himself,  he will  become  more  realistically socialized. We  do  not  need  to  ask  who  will  control  his  aggressive impulses;  for  as  he  becomes  more  open  to  all  of  his  impulses,  his need  to  be  liked  by  others  and  his  tendency  to  give  affection  will be  as  strong  as  his  impulses  to  strike  out  or  to  seize  for  himself. He will be aggressive in situations  in  which  aggression is realistically appropriate,  but  there  will  be  no  runaway  need  for  aggression. His total  behavior,  in  these  and  other  areas,  as  he  moves  toward  being open  to  all  his  experience,  will  be  more  balanced  and  realistic,  be­ havior  which  is  appropriate  to  the  survival  and  enhancement  of  a highly  social  animal.\nI  have  little  sympathy  with  the  rather  prevalent concept  that  man is  basically  irrational,  and  that  his  impulses,  if  not  controlled,  will lead  to  destruction  of  others  and  self. Man's  behavior  is  exquisitely rational,  moving  with  subtle  and  ordered  complexity  toward  the\ngoals  his  organism  is  endeavoring  to  achieve. The  tragedy  for  most of us is that our defenses keep us from being aware of this rationality, so  that  consciously  we  are  moving  in  one  direction,  while  organismically we are moving in another.  But in our person who is living the process of the good life, there would be a decreasing number of such barriers, and he would be increasingly a participant in the  rationality of his organism.  The  only control of impulses which would  exist, or which  would  prove  necessary,  is  the  natural  and  internal  balancing of  one  need  against  another,  and  the  discovery  of  behaviors  which follow  the  vector  most  closely  approximating  the  satisfaction  of  all needs. The  experience  of  extreme  satisfaction  of  one  need  (for  ag­ gression, or sex,  etc.)  in such  a  way  as  to  do  violence  to  the  satisfac­ tion of other needs  (for  companionship,  tender relationship,  etc.) an  experience  yen'-  common  in  the  defensively  organized  person would be greatly decreased.  He would participate in the  vastly com­ plex self-regulatory activities  of  his  organism - the psychological  as well  as  physiological  thermostatic  controls - in  such  a  fashion  as  to live in  increasing harmony with  himself  and  with  others.",

To  be  a part  of  this  process  means  that  one  is  involved  in  the  frequently frightening and  frequently  satisfying  experience  of  a  more  sensitive living,  with  greater  range,  greater variety,  greater  richness. It  seems to me that clients who  have moved significantly in therapy live more intimately with their feelings of pain,  but also more vividly with their feelings of  ecstasy; that anger  is more  clearly  felt,  but so  also  is  love; that fear  is an  experience they know more  deeply,  but so  is  courage. And the  reason they can thus live  fully in a  wider  range  is that they have  this underlying  confidence  in  themselves as trustworthy  instru­ ments  for  encountering  life.\nI  believe  it will  have  become  evident why,  for me,  adjectives such as  happy,  contented,  blissful,  enjoyable,  do  not  seem  quite  appro­ priate  to  any  general  description  of  this  process  I  have  called  the good  life,  even  though  the  person  in  this  process  would  experience\neach  one  of  these  feelings  at  appropriate  times. But  the  adjcctives which  seem  more  generally  fitting  are  adjectives  such  as  enriching, cxciting,  rewarding,  challenging,  meaningful. This  proccss  of  the good  life  is  not,  I  am  convinced,  a  life  for  the  faint-hearted. It  in­ volves  the  stretching  and  growing  of  becoming  more  and  more  of one's potentialities.  It involves the  courage to be.  It means launching oneself  fully  into  the  stream  of  life. Yet  the  deeply  exciting  thing about  human beings is  that  when  the  individual  is  inwardly  free,  he chooscs as the  good  life  this  proccss  of becoming.",

A  Philosophical  Question\nT his paper stands out for vie as one  which /  found very  satisfying to  'writey   and  which  has  continued  to  be  a  satisfying  expression of my  views.  I  believe  that  one  of  the  reasons  I  have  liked  it  is  that it  was  written  solely  for  ?nyself. I  had  no  thought  of  publishing  it or using  it  for  any  purpose  other  than  to  clarify  a  growing  puzzle­ ment and conflict within myself.\nAs I  look  back  on  it  I  can  recognize  the  origin  of  the  conflict. It was  between  the  logical  positivism  in  which  I  was  educated,  for which I  had a  deep  respect, and  the  subjectively  oriented  existential thinking which was taking root in vie because it seemed to fit so well with  viy  therapeutic  experience.\n1  am  not  a  student  of  existential  philosophy. I  first became  ac­ quainted  with  the  work  of  S0ren  Kierkegaard  and  that  of  Martin Buber at the insistence of some of the theological students at Chicago who were  taking work with me. They  were  sure  that  I  would  find the  thinking  of  these  men  congenial,  and  in  this  they  were  largely correct. While there is much  in Kierkegaard, for  example, to which I respond not at all, there are, every  now and then, deep  insights and convictions  which  beautifully  express  views  1  have  held  but  never been  able  to  formulate. Though  Kierkegaard  lived  one  hundred years ago, I cannot help but regard him as a sensitive and highly  per-\n190\nceptive  friend. I think  this  paper  shows  my  indebtedness  to  him, mostly  in  the  fact  that  reading  his  work  loosened  me  up  and  made me  more  willing  to  trust  and  express  my  own  experience.\nAnother  helpful  element  in  writing  the  paper  was  that  I  was  fa? away  from colleagues, wintering in  Taxco,  when  I  wrote  the majoi portion  of  it. A  year  later,  on  the  Caribbean  island  of  Grenada,  / completed the  paper by  writing  the final section.\nAs with several of  the  other  papers in  this  volume,  /  had  it  dupli­ cated for reading by my colleagues and students.  After several years, at  the  suggestion  of  others,  I  submitted  it  for  publication  and  it  was accepted,  rather  to  my  surprise,  by  the  American  Psychologist. I have included it here because it seems to express, better than anything else  I  have  written,  the  context  in  which  I  see  research,  and  makes clear the reason for my  ' double life'  of subjectivity  and  objectivity.\n5:",

It  will  be  of  interest  to  others  only  to  the  extent  that the  issue  exists for  them. I  shall  therefore  describe  in  this  introduction,  something of  the  way  in  which  the  paper  grew.\nAs  I  have  acquired  experience  as  a  therapist,  carrying  on  the  ex­ citing, rewarding experience of psychotherapy, and as I have worked as a  scientific investigator  to  ferret out some  of the  truth  about ther­ apy,  I  have  become  increasingly  conscious  of  the  gap  between  these two  roles. The  better  therapist  I  have  bccomc  (as  I  believe  I  have) the  more  I  have  been  vaguely  aware  of  my  complete  subjectivity when  I  am  at  my  best  in  this  function. And  as  I have  become  a better  investigator,  more  ' hard-headed'  and  more  scientific (as  I believe  I  have)  I  have  felt  an  increasing  discomfort  at  the  distance between  the  rigorous  objectivity  of  myself  as  scientist  and  the  al­ most mystical  subjectivity  of  myself  as  therapist. This  paper  is  the result.\nWhat I  did  first was to  let  myself go  as  therapist,  and  describe,  as well  as  I  could  do  in  a  brief  space,  what  is  the  essential  nature  of psychotherapy  as  I  have  lived  it  with  many  clients. I would  stress the  fact that  this is  a  very  fluid  and  personal  formulation,  and  that  if it  were  written  by  another  person,  or  it  were  written  by  me  two years ago, or two years hence,  it would be different in some respects. Then  I  let  myself  go  as  scientist -  as  tough-minded  fact-findcr  in this  psychological  realm,  and  endeavored  to  picture  the meaning which  science  can  give  to  therapy. Following  this  I  carried  on  the debate  which  existed  in  me,  raising  the  questions  which  each  point of  view  legitimately  asks  the  other.\nWhen  I  had  carried  my  efforts  this  far  I  found  that  I  had  only sharpened  the  conflict. The  two  points  of  view  seemed  more  than ever irreconcilable.  I  discussed the material with a seminar of faculty and  students,  and  found  their  comments  very  helpful. During  the following  year  I  continued  to  mull  over  the  problem  until  I  began to  feel  an  integration  of  the  two  views  arising  in  me. More  than  a year after the first sections were  written I  tried  to  express this  tenta­ tive  and  perhaps  temporary  integration  in  words.\nThus  the  reader  who  cares  to  follow  my  struggles  in  this  matter will  find  that  it  has  quite  unconsciously  assumed  a  dramatic  form all  of  the dramatis  personae  being  contained  within  myself;  First Protagonist, Second  Protagonist, The  Conflict, and finally, The Resolution.  W ithout more ado let me introduce the first protagonist, myself as  therapist,  portraying  as  well  as  I  can,  what  the  experience of  therapy  seems  to  be.",

I  enter  the  relationship  not  as  a  scientist,  not  as  a  physician  who  can accurately  diagnose  and  cure,  but  as  a  person,  entering  into  a  per­ sonal  relationship. Insofar  as  I  see  him  only  as  an  object,  the  client will  tend  to  become  only  an  object.\nI  risk myself,  because if,  as the  relationship  deepens,  what  develops\nis  a  failure,  a  regression,  a  repudiation  of me  and  the  relationship  by the  client,  then  I  sense  that  I  will  lose  myself,  or  a  part  of  myself. At times  this  risk  is  very  real,  and  is  very  keenly  experienced.\nI  let  m yself  go  into  the  immediacy  of  the  relationship  where  it  is my  total  organism  which  takes  over  and  is  sensitive  to  the  relation­ ship, not simply  my  consciousness. I  am  not  consciously  responding in  a  planful  or analytic  way,  but simply  react in  an  unreflective way to the other  individual,  my  reaction  being  based, (but  not  con­ sciously) on  my  total  organismic  sensitivity  to  this  other  person. I  live  the  relationship  on  this  basis.\nThe  essence  of  some  of  the  deepest  parts  of  therapy  seems  to  be a  unity  of  experiencing. The  client  is  freely  able  to  experience  his feeling  in  its  complete  intensity,  as  a  ' pure  culture,'  without  intel­ lectual  inhibitions or cautions, without  having it bounded  by  knowl­ edge of contradictory  feelings; and  I  am  able  with  equal  freedom  to experience  my  understanding  of  this  feeling,  without  any  conscious thought about it,  without any  apprehension  or  concern  as  to  where this  will  lead,  without  any  type  of  diagnostic  or  analytic  thinking, without  any  cognitive  or  emotional  barriers  to  a  complete  'letting go' in understanding.  When there  is this complete unity,  singleness, fullness of experiencing in  the  relationship,  then  it acquires  the  'outof-this-world'  quality  which  many  therapists  have  remarked  upon, a  sort  of  trance-like  feeling  in  the  relationship  from  which  both  the client  and  I  emerge  at  the  end  of  the  hour,  as  if  from  a  deep  well or  tunnel. In  these  moments  there  is,  to  borrow  Buber's  phrase,  a real  ' I-Thou'  relationship,  a  timeless  living  in  the  experience  which is  between  the  client  and  me. It  is  at  the  opposite  pole  from  seeing the  client,  or  myself,  as  an  object. It  is  the  height  of  personal  sub­ jectivity.\nI am often aware of the fact that I do not know, cognitively, where this  immediate  relationship  is  leading. It  is  as  though  both  I  and  the client,  often  fearfully,  let ourselves  slip  into  the  stream  of becoming, a  stream  or  process  which  carries  us  along. It  is  the fact  that  the therapist  has  let  himself  float  in this  stream  of  experience  or  life previously,  and  found  it  rewarding,  that  makes  him  each  time  less fearful of taking the  plunge.  It  is my confidence  that makes it easier for  the  client  to  embark  also,  a  little  bit  at  a  time. It  often  seems\nas  though  this  stream  of  experiencing  leads  to  some  goal. Probably the truer  statement  however,  is  that its rewarding  character  lies within  the  process  itself,  and  that  its  major  reward  is  that  it  enables both  the  client  and  me,  later,  independently,  to  let  ourselves  go  in the  process  of  becoming.\nAs  to  the  client,  as  therapy  proceeds,  he  finds  that  he  is  daring  to become  himself,  in  spite  of  all  the  dread  consequences  which  he  is sure  will  befall  him  if  he  permits  himself  to  become  himself. What docs  this  becoming  one's  self  mean? It  appears  to  mean  less  fear  of the  organismic,  non-reflective  reactions  which  one  has,  a  gradual growth  of  trust  in  and  even  affection  for  the  complex,  varied,  rich assortment  of  feelings  and  tendencies  which  exist  in  one  at  the  or­ ganic or organismic level. Consciousness, instead of being the watchman  over  a  dangerous  and  unpredictable  lot  of  impulses,  of which  few  can  be  permitted  to  sec  the  light  of  day,  becomes  the comfortable  inhabitant  of  a  richly  varied  society  of  impulses  and feelings  and  thoughts,  which  prove  to  be  very  satisfactorily  selfgoverning  when  not  fearfully  or  authoritatively  guarded.\nInvolved in this  process  of becoming himself is a profound experi­ ence  of personal  choice. He  realizes  that  he  can  choose  to  continue to  hide  behind  a  fagade,  or  that  he  can  take  the  risks  involved  in being himself;  that  he  is a  free  agent  who  has  it  within  his  power  to destroy  another,  or  himself,  and  also  the  power  to  enhance  himself and  others. Faced  with  this  naked  reality  of  decision,  he  chooses to  move in  the  direction  of  being  himself.\nBut being  himself  doesn't  'solve  problems.' It  simply  opens  up  a new way of living in  which  there  is more  depth  and  more  height  in the  experience  of  his  feelings;  more  breadth  and  more  range. He feels more unique and  hence more alone, but  he is so  much more  real that  his  relationships  with  others  lose  their  artificial  quality,  become deeper,  more  satisfying,  and  draw  more  of  the  realness  of  the  other person into the relationship.\nAnother  way  of  looking  at  this  process,  this  relationship,  is  that it is  a  learning by the client  (and by  the  therapist,  to  a  lesser extent). But  it  is  a  strange  type  o f  learning. Almost  never  is  the  learning notable by its complexity,  and at its  deepest the  learnings never seem to  fit  well  into  verbal  symbols. Often  the  learnings  take  such  simple\nforms  as  ' I  am  different  from  others' ;  ' I  do  feci  hatred  for  him' ; ' I  am  fearful  of  feeling  dependent' ;  ' I  do  feel  sorry  for  myself' ; ' I  am self-centered' ;  ' I  do  have tender and loving feelings' ; '1  could be  what  1   want  to  be' ;  etc. But  in  spite  of  their  seeming  simplicity these  learnings are  vastly significant  in  some  new way  which  is very difficult  to  define. We  can  think  of  it  in  various  ways. They  are self-appropriated  learnings,  for  one  thing,  based  somehow  in  experi­ ence, not in symbols.  They arc analogous to the learning of the child who knows that 'two and two make four' and who one day playing with  two  objccts  and  two  objects,  suddenly  realizes  in  experience  a totally  new  learning,  that  'two  and  two  do  make  four.'\nAnother  manner  of  understanding  these  learnings  is  that  they  are a  belated  attempt  to  match  symbols  with  meanings  in  the  world  of feelings,  an  undertaking  long  since  achieved  in  the  cognitive  realm. Intellectually,  we  match  carefully  the  symbol  we  select  with  the meaning which an experience has for  us.  Thus I say  something  hap­ pened  ' gradually,'  having  quickly  (and  largely  unconsciously)  re­ viewed such terms as ' slowly,' ' imperceptibly,' ' step-by-step,' etc.,  and  rejected  them  as  not  carrying the  precise  shade  of meaning of the experience.  But in the realm of feelings, we have never learned to attach symbols to experience with any accuracy of meaning.  This something  which  I  feel  welling  up  in  myself,  in  the  safety  of  an acccptant  relationship - what  is  it? Is  it  sadness,  is  it  anger,  is  it regret,  is  it  sorrow  for  myself,  is  it  anger  at  lost  opportunities -  I stumble around  trying out a wide  range  of symbols,  until  one  ' fits,' 'feels  right,'  seems  really  to  match  the  organismic  experience. In doing  this  type  of  thing  the  client  discovers  that  he  has  to  learn  the language  of  feeling  and  emotion  as  if  he  were  an  infant  learning  to speak;  often  even  worse,  he  finds  he  must  unlearn  a  false  language before  learning  the  true  one.\nLet  us  try  still  one  more  way  of  defining  this  type  of  learning, this  time  by  describing  what it  is not. It  is  a  type  o f  learning  which cannot be  taught. The  essence  of  it  is  the  aspect  of  self-discovery. With  'knowledge'  as we  are  accustomed  to  think  of  it,  one  person can  teach  it  to  another,  providing  each  has  adequate  motivation  and ability. But  in  the  significant  learning  which  takes  place  in  therapy, one  person  cannot  teach  another. The  teaching  would  destroy  the",

Thus  I  might  teach  a  client  that  it  is  safe  for  him  to  be himself,  that  freely  to  realize  his  feelings  is  not  dangerous,  etc. The more  he  learned  this,  the  less  he  would  have  learned  it  in  the  signif­ icant,  experiential,  self-appropriating  way. Kierkegaard  regards  this latter type of learning as true  subjectivity,  and  makes the  valid  point that  there  can  be  no  direct  communication  of  it,  or  even  about  it. The most that one person can do to further  it in  another,  is to  create certain  conditions which  make this  type  of learning possible. It  can­ not  be  compelled.\nA  final  way  of  trying  to  describe  this  learning  is  that  the  client gradually  learns  to  symbolize  a  total  and  unified  state,  in  which  the state  of  the  organism,  in  experience,  feeling,  and  cognition  may  all be  described  in  one  unified  way. To  make  the  matter  even  more vague  and  unsatisfactory,  it  seems  quite  unnecessary  that  this  sym­ bolization  should  be  expressed. It  usually  does  occur,  because  the client  wishes  to  communicate  at  least  a  portion  of  himself  to  the therapist,  but  it  is  probably  not  essential. The only  necessary aspect is  the  inward  realization  of  the  total,  unified,  immediate,  'at-this-instant,'  state  of  the  organism  which  is  me. For  example,  to  realize fully  that  at  this  moment  the  oneness  in  me  is  simply  that  'I  am deeply frightened at the possibility of becoming something different' is  of  the  essence  o f  therapy. The  client  who  realizes  this  will  be quite  certain  to  recognize  and  realize  this  state  of  his  being  when it  recurs  in  somewhat  similar  form. He  will  also,  in  all  probability, recognize  and  realize  more  fully  some  o f  the  other  existential  feel­ ings which occur  in  him.  Thus  he  will  be  moving  toward  a  state  in which he is more truly himself. He  will  be,  in  more  unified  fashion, what he organismically is, and this seems to be the essence of therapy.",

        "text": "I shall  now let the second protagonist, myself  as scientist,  take over and  give  his  view  of  this  same  field.\nIn  approaching  the  complex  phenomena  of therapy  with  the  logic and  methods  of science,  the  aim  is  to  work  toward  an understanding of the  phenomena.  In science this  means  an  objective  knowledge  of\nevents and  of  functional  relationships  between  events. Science  may also  give  the  possibility  of  increased  prediction  of  and  control  over these  events,  but  this  is  not  a  necessary  outcome  of  scientific  en­ deavor. If  the  scientific  aim  were  fully  achieved  in  this  realm,  we would  presumably  know  that,  in  therapy,  certain elements  were associated  with  certain  types  of  outcomes. Knowing  this  it  is  likely that  we  would  be  able  to  predict  that  a  particular  instance  of  a therapeutic relationship would have a certain outcome (within certain  probability  limits)  because  it  involved  certain  elements. We could then very likely control outcomes of therapy by our manipula­ tion  of  the  elements  contained  in  the  therapeutic  relationship.\nIt  should  be  clear  that  no  matter  how  profound  our  scientific  in­ vestigation,  we  could  never  by  means  of  it  discover  any  absolute truth,  but  could  only  describe  relationships  which  had  an  increas­ ingly  high  probability  of  occurrence. Nor  could  we  ever  discover any underlying reality in  regard  to  persons,  relationships  or  the  uni­ verse. We  could  only  describe relationships  between  observable events.  If science  in  this field  followed  the course  of science  in  other fields,  the  working  models  of  reality  which  would  emerge  (in  the course  of  theory  building) would  be  increasingly  removed  from the  reality  perceived  by  the  senses. The  scientific  description  of therapy  and  therapeutic relationships  would  become  increasingly unlike  these  phenomena  as  they  are  experienced.\nIt is  evident at the outset that since therapy is a  complex  phenome­ non, measurement  will  be  difficult. Nevertheless  'anything  that exists  can  be  measured,'  and  since  therapy  is  judged  to  be  a  signif­ icant  relationship,  with  implications  extending  far  beyond  itself,  the difficulties may  prove  to  be  worth  surmounting  in  order, to  discover laws  of  personality  and  interpersonal  relationships.\nSince, in client-centered therapy, there already  exists a crude theory  (though  not  a  theory  in  the  strictly  scientific  sense) we have a starting point for the selection of hypotheses.  For purposes of this  discussion,  let  us  take  some  of  the  crude  hypotheses  which  can be  drawn  from  this  theory,  and  see  what  a  scientific  approach  will do  with  them. We will,  for  the  time  being,  omit  the  translation  of the  total  theory  into  a  formal  logic  which  would  be  acceptable  and consider  only a  few  of the  hypotheses.\nPersons  or  Science?\nLet  us  first  state  three  of  these  in  their  crude  form.\n1. Acceptance  of  the  client  by  the  therapist  leads  to  an  increased acceptance  of  self  by  the  client.\n2.  The  more  the  therapist  perceives  the  client  as  a  person  rather than as an  object,  the  more  the  clicnt  will  come  to  perceive  himself as  a  person  rather  than  an  object.\n3.  In  the  course  of  therapy  an  experiential  and  effective  type  of learning  about  self  takes  place  in  the  client.\nHow  would  we  go  about  translating  each  of  these*  into  opera­ tional  terms  and  how  would  we  test  the  hypotheses? What would be  the  general  outcomes  of such  testing?\nThis  paper  is  not  the  place  for  a  detailed  answer  to  these  ques­ tions,  but  research already  carried  on  supplies  the  answers  in  a  gen­ eral  way. In  the  case  of  the  first hypothesis,  certain  devices  for measuring  acceptance  would  be  selected  or  devised. These  might be  attitude  tests,  objective  or  projective,  Q  technique  or  the  like. Presumably the same instruments, with slightly different instructions or  mind  set,  could  be  used  to  measure  the  therapist's  acceptance  of the  client,  and  the  client's  acceptance  of  self. Operationally  then, the  degree  of  therapist  acceptance  would  be  equated  to  a  certain score  on  this  instrument. Whether  client  self-acceptance  changed during  therapy  would  be  indicated  by  pre-  and  post-measurements. The  relationship  of  any  change  to  therapy  would  be  determined bv  comparison  of  changes  in  therapy  to  changes  during  a  control period  or  in  a  control  group. We  would  finally  be  able  to  say whether  a  relationship existed between  therapist  acceptance and client  self-acceptance,  as  operationally  defined,  and  the  correlation between  the  two.\nThe  second  and  third  hypotheses  involve  real  difficulty  in  meas-\n· It  may  be  surprising  to  some  to  find  hypotheses  regarding  such  subjective experience treated  as  matters  for  an  objective  science. Yet  the  best  thinking in  psychology  has  gone  far  beyond  a  primitive  behaviorism,  and  has  recog­ nized  that  the objectivity  of  psychology  as  science rests upon  its  method, not  upon  its  content. Thus  the  most  subjective  feelings,  apprehensions,  ten­ sions, satisfactions,  or reactions,  may be  dealt  with  scientifically,  providing  only that  they may  be  given  clearcut operational definition. Stephenson,  among others,  presents  this  point  o f  view  forcefully  (in  his  Postulates  of  Behaviorism) and  through  his  Q  Technique,  has  contributed  importantly  to  the  oojcctification of such subjective materials for scientific study.\nuremcnt,  but  there  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  they  could  not  be objectively  studied,  as  our  sophistication  in  psychological  measure­ ment  increases. Some  type  of  attitude  test  or  Q-sort  might  be  the instrument  for  the second  hypothesis, measuring  the  attitude of therapist  toward  client,  and  of  clicnt  toward  self. In  this  case  the continuum would  be  from  objective  regard  of  an  external  object  to a personal  and  subjective  experiencing. The  instrumentation for hypothesis  three  might  be  physiological,  since  it  seems  likely  that experiential  learning  has  physiologically  measurable  concomitants. Another  possibility  would  be  to infer  experiential  learning from its effectiveness,  and  thus  measure  the  effectiveness  of  learning  in different  areas. At the  present  stage  of our  methodology  hypothesis three might be beyond us, but certainly within the foreseeable future, it  too  could  be  given  operational  definition  and  tested.\nThe  findings  from  these  studies  w ould  be  o f  this  order. Let  us become suppositious,  in  order to  illustrate more  concretely. Suppose ure  find  that  therapist  acceptance  leads  to  clicnt  self-acceptance,  and that  the  correlation  is  in  the  neighborhood  of  .70  betw een  the  tw o variables. In  hypothesis  tw o  w e  m ight  find  the  hypothesis  unsup­ ported,  but  find  that  the  more  the  therapist  regarded  the  client  as  a person,  the  more  the  client's  self-acceptance  increased. Thus  we would  have  learned  that  person-centeredncss  is  an  element  of  ac­ ceptance,  but  that  it  has  little  to  do  w ith  the  client  becom ing  more of  a  person  to  himself. Let  us  also  suppose  hypothesis  three  upheld with  experiential  learning  o f  ccrtain  dcscribable  sorts  taking  place much  more  in  therapy  than  in  the  control  subjects.\nGlossing over all  the  qualifications and  ramifications  which would be present  in  the  findings,  and  omitting  reference  to  the  unexpected leads  into  personality  dynamics  which  would  crop  up  (since  these are  hard  to  imagine  in  advance) the  preceding  paragraph  gives  us some  notion  of  what  science  can  offer  in  this  field. It  can  give  us  a more  and  more  exact  description  of  the  events  of  therapy  and  the changes which  take  place. It  can  begin  to  formulate  some  tentative laws  of  the  dynamics  of  human  relationships. It  can  offer  public and replicable  statements,  that if certain operationally  definable  con­ ditions exist  in  the therapist  or  in  the  relationship,  then  certain  clicnt behaviors  may  be  expected  with  a  known  degree  of  probability. It\ncan  presumably  do  this  for  the  field of  therapy  and  personality change  as  it  is  in  the  process  of  doing  for  such  fields  as  perception and  learning. Eventually  theoretical  formulations  should  draw  to­ gether  these  different  areas,  enunciating  the  laws  which  appear  to govern  alteration  in  human  behavior,  whether  in  the  situations  we classify  as  perception,  those we  classify  as  learning, or  the  more global  and  molar  changes  which  occur  in  therapy,  involving  both perception  and  learning.",

As presented  here,  and  as they frequently  exist,  there  seems  almost  no  common  meeting  ground between  the  two  descriptions. Each  represents  a  vigorous  way  of seeing  therapy. Each seems to  be  an avenue  to  the  significant  truths of therapy.  When each of these  views are held  by  different  individ­ uals  or  groups,  they constitute  a  basis  of sharp  disagreement. When each  of  these  approaches  seems  true  to  one  individual,  like  myself, then  he  feels  himself  conflicted  by  these  two  views. Though  they may  superficially  be  reconciled,  or  regarded  as  complementary  to each  other,  they  seem  to  me  to  be  basically  antagonistic  in  many ways.

        "text": "First  let  me  pose  some  of  the  questions  which  the scientific  view­ point asks of the  experiential  (using scientific  and  experiential  simply as  loose  labels to  indicate  the  two  views). The  hard-headed scientist listens  to  the  experiential  account,  and  raises  several  searching  ques­ tions.\n1. First  of  all  he  wants  to  know,  ' How  can  you  know  that  this account,  or  any  account  given  at  a  previous  or  later  time,  is  true? How do you know that it has any  relationship  to  reality? If we  are to  rely  on  this  inner  and  subjective  experience  as  being  the  truth\nabout  human  relationships  or  about  ways  of  altering  personality, then  Yogi,  Christian  Scicnce,  dianetics,  and  the  delusions  of  a  psy­ chotic individual who believes  himself to  be Jesus Christ, are all true, just  as  true  as  this  account. Each  of  them  represents  the  truth  as perceived  inwardly  by  some individual or group  of  individuals. If  we  are  to  avoid  this  morass  of  multiple  and  contradictory  truths, we  must  fall  back  on  the  only  method  we  know  for  achieving  an evcr-closer  approximation  to  reality,  the  scientific  method.'\n2. ' In  the  second  place,  this  experiential  approach  shuts  one  off from  improving  his  therapeutic  skill,  or  discovering  the  less  than satisfactory  elements in the relationship. Unless  one  regards  the present description as a perfect one,  which is unlikely, or  the present level  of experience  in  the  therapeutic  relationship  as  being  the  most effective possible,  which is equally unlikely,  then there  are  unknown flaws,  imperfections,  blind  spots,  in  the  account  as  given. How  are these to be discovered and corrected?  The experiential approach can offer  nothing but a trial  and  error process for achieving this,  a  proc­ ess which is slow and which offers no real guarantee of achieving this goal. Even  the  criticisms  or  suggestions  of  others  are  of  little  help, since  they do not arise from within  the  experience and  hence  do  not have  the  vital  authority  of  the  relationship  itself. But  the  scientific method,  and  the  procedures  of  a  modern  logical  positivism,  have much  to  offer  here. Any  experience  which  can  be  described  at  all can  be  described  in  operational  terms. Hypotheses  can  be  formu­ lated  and  put  to  test,  and  the  sheep  of  truth  can  thus  be  separated from  the  goats of error. This seems the  only sure  road  to  improve­ ment,  self-correction,  growth  in  knowledge.'\n3. The scientist  has  another  comment to  make. ' Implicit  in  your description of the  therapeutic  experience seems to be  the  notion that there  are  elements  in  it  which  cannot  be  predicted - that  there  is some  type  of  spontaneity  or  (excuse  the  term)  free  will  operative here. You  speak  as  though some  of  the  client's  behavior - and  per­ haps  some  of  the  therapist's - is  not  caused,  is  not  a  link  in  a  se­ quence of cause and  effect. Without desiring to become  metaphysi­ cal,  may  I  raise  the  question  as  to  whether  this  is  defeatism? Since surely  we  can  discover  what  causes  much  of  behavior - you  your­ self  speak  of  creating  the  conditions  where  certain  behavioral  re­\nsuits  follow - then  why  give  up  at  any  point? Why  not  at  least aim  toward  uncovering  the  causes  of  all  behavior? This  does  not mean  that  the  individual  mui>t  regard  himself  as  an  automaton,  but in  our search  for  the  facts  we  shall  not  be  hampered  by a  belief that some doors are closed to us.'\n4. Finally,  the  scientist  cannot  understand  why  the  therapist,  the experientialist,  should  challenge  the  one  tool  and  method  which  is responsible  for almost all  the  advances which we  value. ' In  the  cur­ ing of  disease,  in  the  prevention  of  infant  mortality,  in  the  growing of  larger  crops,  in  the  preservation  of  food,  in  the  manufacture  of all  the  things  that  make  life  comfortable,  from  books  to  nylon,  in the  understanding  of  the  universe,  what  is  the  foundation  stone? It is  the  method of science, applied to  each  of these,  and to many other problems. It  is  true  that  it  has  improved  methods  of  warfare,  too, serving  man's  destructive  as  well  as  his  constructive  purposes,  but even  here the potentiality for social  usefulness is very great.  So why should  we  doubt  this  same  approach  in  the  social  science  field? To be sure  advances here  have  been  slow,  and  no  law  as  fundamental  as the  law  of  gravity  has  as  yet  been  demonstrated,  but are  we  to  give up this approach out of impatience? What possible alternative offers equal  hope? If  we  are  agreed  that  the  social  problems  of  the  world are  very  pressing  indeed,  if  psychotherapy  offers  a  window  into the  most  crucial  and  significant  dynamics  of  change  in  human  be­ havior, then surely the course of action is to apply  to  psychotherapy the  most  rigorous  canons  of  scientific  method,  on  as  broad  a  scale as  possible,  in  order  that  we  may  most  rapidly  approach  a  tentative knowledge  of  the  laws  of  individual  behavior  and  of  attitudinal change.'",

        "text": "While  the  scientist's  questions  may  seem  to  some  to  settle  the matter,  his  comments  are  far  from  being  entirely  satisfying  to  the therapist who  has  lived  the  experience  of  therapy. Such  an  individ­ ual  has  several  points  to make  in  regard  to  the  scientific  view.\n1. ' In  the  first  place,'  this  ' experientialist'  points  out,  'science always  has  to  do  with  the  other,  the  object. Various  logicians  of science,  including  Stevens,  the  psychologist,  show  that  it  is  a  basic\nelement  of  science  that  it  always  has  to  do  with  the  observable  ob­ ject,  the  observable  other. This  is  true,  even  if  the  scientist  is  ex­ perimenting  on  himself,  for  to  that  degree  he  treats  himself  as  the observable  other. It  never  has  anything to  do  with  the  experiencing me.  Now does not this quality  of science  mean  that  it must  forever be  irrelevant  to  an  experience  such  as  therapy,  which  is  intensely personal,  highly  subjective  in  its  inwardness,  and  dependent  entirely on  the relationship of two individuals each  of whom  is an  experienc­ ing  me?  Science  can  of  course  study  the  events  which  occur,  but always in a way which is irrelevant to what is occurring.  An analogy would  be  to  say  that  science  can  conduct  an  autopsy  of  the  dead events of therapy,  but by  its  very  nature  it  can  never  enter  into  the living  physiology  of  therapy. It is for  this  reason  that  therapists recognize - usually  intuitively - that  any  advance  in  therapy,  any fresh  knowledge  of  it,  any  significant  new  hypotheses  in  regard  to it - must  come  from  the  experience  of  the  therapists  and  clients, and  can  never  come  from  science. Again  to  use  an  analogy. Cer­ tain  heavenly  bodies  were  discovered  solely  from  examination  of the  scientific  measurements  of  the  courses  of  the  stars. Then  the astronomers searched for these hypothesized bodies and  found  them. It seems decidedly unlikely that there will  ever be  a similar  outcome in  therapy,  since  science  has  nothing  to  say  about  the  internal  per­ sonal  experience  which  T   have  in  therapy. It  can  only  speak  of the  events  which  occur  in  'him.' '\n2. 'Because science  has as its  field the  'other,'  the  'object,*  it means that  everything  it  touches  is  transformed  into  an  object. This  has never presented a problem in the physical sciences. In  the  biological sciences  it  has  caused  certain  difficulties. A  number of medical  men feel some concern as to whether the increasing tendency  to  view  the human  organism  as  an  object,  in  spite  of  its  scientific  efficacy,  may not  be  unfortunate  for  the  patient. They  would  prefer  to  see  him again  regarded  as a  person. It  is  in  the  social  sciences,  however,  that this  becomes  a  genuinely  serious  issue. It means  that  the  people studied  by  the  social  scientist  are  always  objects. In  therapy,  both client  and  therapist  become  objects  for  dissection,  but  not  persons with  whom  one  enters  a  living  relationship. At  first  glance,  this may not seem  important.  W e may say that only in  his role  as scien­\ntist  does  the  individual  regard  others  as  objects. He  can  also  step out of this  role  and  become  a  person. But if  we  look  a  little  further we  will  see  that  this  is  a  superficial  answer. If  we  project  ourselves into  the  future,  and  suppose  that we  had  the  answers  to  most  of  the questions  which  psychology  investigates  today,  what  then? Then we would find ourselves increasingly impelled to treat all  others, and even ourselves, as objects.  The knowledge of all  human  relationships would  be  so  great  that  we  would  know  it  rather  than  live  the  rela­ tionships unreflectively.  We see some foretaste of this  in  the attitude of  sophisticated  parents  who  know  that  affection  'is  good  for  the child.' This  knowledge  frequently  stands  in  the  way  of  their  being themselves,  freely,  unreflectivclv -  affectionate  or  not. Thus  the development of  science  in  a  field  like  therapy  is  either  irrelevant  to the  experience,  or  may  actually  make  it  more  difficult  to  live  the relationship  as  a  personal,  experiential  event.'\n3. The experientialist has a further concern.  'When science trans­ forms people  into  objects,  as  mentioned  above,  it  has  another  effect. The end result of scicnce  is  to  lead  toward manipulation.  This is less true  in  fields  like  astronomy,  but  in  the  physical  and  social  sciences, the knowledge of the events and  their  relationships lead  to manipula­ tion of some  of the  elements of  the  equation.  This  is unquestionably true  in  psychology,  and  would  be  true  in  therapy. If  we  know  all about how learning takes place, we use that knowledge to manipulate persons  as objects. This  statement  places  no  value judgment  on manipulation. It  may  be  done  in  highly  cthical  fashion. Wc  may even  manipulate  ourselves  as  objects,  using  such  knowledge. Thus, knowing  that  learning  takes  place  more  rapidly  with  repeated  re­ view rather  than  long periods of concentration  on  one  lesson,  I  may use this knowledge to manipulate my learning in Spanish.  But knowl­ edge is power. As  I  learn the  laws  o f learning  I  use them  to  manipu­ late  others  through  advertisements,  through  propaganda, through prediction  of  their  responses  and  the  control  of  those  responses. It is  not  too  strong  a  statement  to  say  that  the  growth  of  knowledge in  the social  sciences  contains within  itself  a powerful  tendency toward  social  control,  toward  control  of  the  many  by  the  few. An equally  strong  tendency is toward  the  weakening  or  destruction of  the  existential  person. When all  are  regarded  as  objects,  the  sub­\njective individual, the  inner self, the person  in the process of becom­ ing,  the  unrcflective  consciousness  of  being,  the  whole  inward  side of  living  life,  is  weakened,  devalued,  or  destroyed. Perhaps  this  is best exemplified by two books.  Skinner's  Walden  Tw o  is  a psychol­ ogist's  picture  of  paradise. To  Skinner  it  must  have  seemed  de­ sirable,  unless  he  wrote  it as  a  tremendous  satire. At any  rate  it  is  a paradise  of  manipulation,  in  which  the  extent  to  which  one  can  be a  person  is  greatly  reduced,  unless  one  can  be  a  member  of  the  rul­ ing council. Huxley's  Brave  New  World  is  frankly  satire,  but  por­ trays vividly the loss of personhood which  he sees as associated  with increasing  psychological  and  biological  knowledge. Thus,  to  put it  bluntly, it  seems  that  a  developing  social  science (as  now  con­ ceived  and  pursued)  leads  to  social  dictatorship  and  individual  loss of  personhood. The  dangers  perceived  by  Kierkegaard  a  century ago  in  this  respect  seem  much  more  real  now,  with  the  increase  of knowledge,  than  they  could  have  then.'\n4. ' Finally,'  says  the  experientialist,  ' doesn't  all  this  point  to  the fact  that  ethics  is  a  more  basic  consideration  than  science? I am not blind  to  the  value  of  science  as  a  tool,  and  am  aware  that  it  can be  a  very  valuable  tool. But  unless  it  is  the  tool  of  ethical  persons, with  all  that  the  term  persons  implies,  may  it  not  become  a  Jugger­ naut? We  have  been  a  long  time  recognizing  this  issue,  because  in physical  science  it  took  centuries  for  the  ethical  issue  to  become crucial, but it has at last become so. In  the social  sciences  the  ethical issues  arise  much  more  quickly,  because  persons  are  involved. But in  psychotherapy  the  issue  arises  most  quickly  and most  deeply. Here  is  the  maximizing  of  all  that  is  subjective,  inward,  personal; here  a  relationship  is  lived,  not  examined,  and  a  person,  not  an  ob­ ject,  emerges;  a  person  who  feels,  chooses,  believes,  acts,  not  as  an automaton,  but  as  a  person. And  here  too  is  the  ultimate  in  science -  the  objective  exploration  of  the  most  subjective  aspects  of  life; the  reduction  to  hypotheses,  and  eventually  to  theorems,  of  all  that has  been  regarded  as  most  personal,  most  completely  inward,  most thoroughly a  private  world. And  because  these  two  views  come  so sharply  into  focus  here,  we  must  make  a  choice - an  ethical  per­ sonal  choice  of values. We may do it by  default,  by  not  raising the question. We  may  be  able  to  make  a  choice  which  will  somehow\nconserve  both  values - but  choose  we  must. And  I  am  asking  that we think long and  hard  before we  give  up  the  values that pertain  to being a person, to experiencing,  to  living a relationship,  to becoming, that  pertain  to  one's  self  as  a  process,  to  one's  self  in  the  existential moment,  to  the  inward  subjective  self  that  lives.'",

        "text": "In  the  year  which  has  elapsed  since  the  foregoing  material  was written,  I  have  from  time  to  time  discussed  the  issues  with  students, colleagues and  friends.  T o   some  of  them  I  am  particularly  indebted for  ideas  which  have  taken  root  in  me.* Gradually  I  have  come  to believe  that  the  most  basic  error  in  the original  formulation  was in  the description of science. I  should  like,  in  this  section,  to  attempt to  correct  that  error,  and  in  the  following  section  to  reconcile  the revised  points  of  view.\nThe major shortcoming wras, I  believe, in viewing  science as some­ thing  'out  there,'  something  spelled  with  a  capital  S,  a  'body  of knowledge' existing somewhere in space and time.  In common with many  psychologists  I  thought  of  science  as  a  systematized  and  or-\n· I  would  like  to  mention  my  special  debt  to  discussions  with,  and  published and unpublished  papers  by  Robert M.  Lipgar, Ross  L. Alooney,  David A. Rodgers  and  Eugene  Streich. My  own  thinking  has  fed  so  deeply  on  theirs, and  become so intertwined  with  theirs,  that I  would  be  at a  loss  to  acknowledge specific  obligations. I only  know  that  in  what  follows  there  is  much  which springs  from  them,  through  me. I have  also profited from  correspondence regarding the  paper  with  Anne  Roe  and  W alter  Smet.\nganized collection of tentatively verified facts, and saw the methodol­ ogy  of  science  as  the  socially  approved  means  of  accumulating  this body  of  knowledge,  and  continuing  its  verification. It  has  seemed somewhat  like  a  reservoir  into  which  all  and  sundry  may  dip  their buckets  to  obtain  water - with  a  guarantee  of  99%  purity. When viewed  in  this  external  and  impersonal  fashion,  it  seems  not  un­ reasonable  to see  Science  not only as  discovering knowledge  in  lofty fashion,  but  as  involving  depersonalization,  a  tendency  to  manipu­ late,  a  denial  of  the  basic  freedom  o f  choice  which  I  have  met  experientially  in  therapy. I should  like now  to  view  the  scientific approach  from  a  different,  and  I  hope,  a  more  accurate  perspective.",

        "text": "Science  has  its  inception  in  a  particular  person  who  is  pursuing aims,  values,  purposes,  which  have  personal  and  subjective  meaning for  him. As  a  part  of  this  pursuit,  he,  in  some  area,  ' wants  to  find out.' Consequently,  if  he is to be  a good  scientist, he  immerses himself  in  the relevant experience, whether  that  be the physics laboratory, the world of plant or animal life, the hospital,  the psycho­ logical  laboratory  or  clinic,  or  whatever. This  immersion  is  com­ plete  and  subjective,  similar  to  the  immersion of  the therapist  in therapy,  described  previously. He  senses  the  field  in  which  he  is interested,  he  lives  it. He  does  more  than  ' think'  about  it - he  lets his organism take  over and  react to  it,  both  on  a  knowing and  on  an\nunknowing  level. He  comes  to  sense  more  than  he  could  possibly verbalize  about  his  field,  and  reacts  organismically  in  terms  of  re­ lationships  which  are  not present in  his  awareness.\nOut  of this complete subjective immersion comes  a creative forming,  a  sense  of  direction,  a  vague  formulation  of  relationships hitherto  unrecognized. Whittled  down,  sharpened,  formulated  in clearer  terms,  this  creative  forming  becomes  a  hypothesis - a  state­ ment of a tentative, personal, subjective  faith.  The scientist is saying, drawing  upon  all  his  knowrn  and  unknown  experience,  that  ' I  have a  hunch  that  such  and  such  a  relationship  exists,  and  the  existence of  this  phenomenon  has  relevance  to  my  personal  values.'\nWhat  I  am  describing  is  the  initial  phase  of  science,  probably  its most  important  phase,  but  one  which  American  scientists,  particu­ larly  psychologists,  have been  prone  to  minimize  or ignore. It  is  not so  much  that  it  has  been  denied  as  that  it  has  been  quickly  brushed off. Kenneth  Spence  has  said  that  this  aspect  of  science  is  'simply taken  for  granted.' * Like  many  experiences  taken  for  granted,  it also  tends  to  be  forgotten. It  is  indeed  in  the  matrix  of  immcdinrc personal,  subjective  experience  that  all  science,  and  each  individual scientific  research,  has  its  origin.",

Experience  has  shown each  one  of  us  that  it  is  very  easy  to  deceive  ourselves,  to  believe something  which  later  experience  shows  is  not  so. How  can  I  tell whether  this  tentative  belief  has  some  real  relationship  to  observed facts? I can  use,  not  one  line  of  evidence  only,  but  several. I can surround  my  observation  of  the  facts  with  various  precautions  to make  sure  I  am  not  deceiving  myself. I can  consult  with  others\n· It may  be  pertinent  to  quote the scntcnces from  which  this  phrase taken. ' .  . .  the  data  of  all  sciences  have  the  same  origin -  namely,  the  imme­ diate  experience  of  an  observing  person,  the  scientist  himself. That  is  to  say, immediate  experience,  the  initial  matrix  out  of  which  all  scien ce s  develop,  is  no longer  considered  a  matter of concern  for the  scientist qua  scientist. He simply takes  it  for granted  and  then  proceeds  to  the  task  of  describing  the  events occurring  in  it  and  discovering  and  formulating  the  nature  of  the  relationships holding  among  them.'

I  can,  in  short,  begin  to  use  all the  elaborate  methodology  which  science  has  accumulated. I dis­ cover  that  stating  my  hypothesis  in operational  terms  will  avoid many  blind  alleys  and  false  conclusions. 1 learn  that  control  groups can  help  me  to  avoid  drawing  false  inferences. I  learn  that  correla­ tions, and t tests and critical ratios and a whole array of statistical pro­ cedures  can  likewise  aid  me  in  drawing  only  reasonable  inferences.\nThus scientific  methodology  is  seen  for  what  it  truly  is -  a  way of  preventing  me  from  deceiving  myself in  regard  to  my  creatively formed  subjective  hunches  which  have  developed  out  of  the  rela­ tionship between  me  and  my material. It  is  in  this  context,  and  per­ haps  only  in  this  context,  that  the  vast  structure  of  operationism, logical  positivism,  research  design, tests  o f significance, etc. have their  place. They  exist,  not  for  themselves,  but  as  servants  in  the attempt  to  check  the  subjective  feeling  or  hunch  or  hypothesis  of  a person with the objective  fact.\nAnd  even  throughout  the  use  of  such  rigorous  and  impersonal methods,  the  important  choices  are  all  made  subjectively  by  the scientist. To  which  of  a  number of  hypotheses  shall  I  devote  time? What land of control  group is most suitable  for avoiding self-decep­ tion  in  this  particular  research? How far shall  I  carry  the  statistical analysis? How  much  credence  may  I  place  in  the  findings? Each of  these  is  necessarily  a  subjective  personal  judgment,  emphasizing that  the  splendid  structure  of  science  rests  basically  upon  its  sub­ jective  use  by  persons. It  is  the  best  instrument  we  have  yet  been able to  devise  to  check  upon  our organismic sensing  of  the  universe.",

I  will regard  them  as  a  springboard  for  further  investigation  and  further seeking.\nIt  seems  to  me  that  in  the  best  of  science,  the  primary  purpose  is to  provide  a  more  satisfactory  and  dependable  hypothesis,  belief, faith,  for  the  investigator  himself. To  the  extent  that  the  scientist is endeavoring  to  prove  something  to  someone  else - an  error  into which  I  have  fallen more  than  once - then  I  believe  he  is  using  sci­ ence to  bolster  a  personal  insecurity,  and  is  keeping  it  from  its truly creative role in the service of the person.\nIn  regard  to  the  findings  of  science,  the  subjective  foundation  is well  shown  in  the  fact  that  at  times  the  scientist  may  refuse  to  be­ lieve  his  own  findings. ' The  experiment  showed  thus  and  so,  but I believe it is wrong,'  is a  theme which  every scientist has experienced at  some  time  or  other. Some  very  fruitful  discoveries  have  grown out of the persistent  disbelief, by  a  scientist,  in  his  own  findings  and those  of  others. In  the  last  analysis  he  may  place  more  trust  in  his total  organismic  reactions  than  in  the  methods  of  science. There  is no  doubt  that  this  can  result  in  serious  error  as  well  as  in  scientific discoveries,  but  it  indicates  again  the  leading  place  of  the  subjective in the use of science.",

This  is  what  is known as  intersubjective  verification,  and  it  plays  an  important  part in  our  understanding  of  science. If  I  take  you  (whether  in  conver­ sation  or  in  print  or  behaviorally)  through  the  steps  I  have  taken  in an investigation, and it seems to you  too that I  have not deceived my­ self,  and  that  I  have  indeed  come  across  a new  relationship  which  is relevant  to  my  values,  and  that  I  am  justified  in  having  a  tentative faith  in this relationship, then we have the beginnings of Science with a  capital  S. It  is  at  this  point  that  we  are  likely  to  think  we  have created  a  body  of  scientific  knowledge. Actually  there  is  no  such body  of  knowledge. There  are  only  tentative  beliefs,  existing  sub­ jectively,  in  a  number  of  different  persons. If  these  beliefs  arc  not tentative,  then  what  exists  is  dogma,  not  science.

The Australian  bushman  will  be quire  unimpressed  with  the  findings of science  regarding bacterial  infection. He  knows that  illness truly is  caused  by  evil  spirits. It  is  only  w  hen  he  too  agrees  to  scientific method as a good means of preventing sclf-dcception, that lie will  be likely to accept its findings.\nBut  even  among  those  who  have  adopted  the  ground  rules  of scicnce,  tentative  belief  in  the  findings  of  a  scientific  research  can only  occur  where  there  is  a  subjective  readiness  to  believe. One could find many examples.  Most psychologists are quite  ready to  be­ lieve  evidence  showing  that  the  lecture  system  produces  significant increments  of  learning,  and  quite  unready  to  believe  that  the  turn of  an  unseen  card  may  be  called  through  an  ability  labelled  extra­ sensory perception. Yet  the  scientific  evidence  for  the  latter  is  con­ siderably  more  impeccable  than  for  the  former. Likewise  when  the so-called  ' Iowa  studies'  first  came  out,  indicating  that  intelligence might  be  considerably  altered  by  environmental  conditions,  there was  great  disbelief  among  psychologists,  and  many  attacks  on  the imperfect  scientific  methods  used. The  scientific  evidence  for  this finding  is  not  much  better  today  than  it  was  when  the  Iowa  studies first  appeared,  but  the  subjective  readiness  of  psychologists  to  be­ lieve  such  a  finding  has  altered  greatly. A  historian  of  science  has noted that empiricists, had they existed at  the  time,  would  have  been the  first  to  disbelieve  the  findings  o f  Copernicus.\nIt  appears  then  that  whether  I  believe  the  scientific  findings  of others,  or  those  from  my  own  studies,  depends  in  part on  my  readi­ ness  to  put  a  tentative  belief  in  such  findings.* One  reason  we  are\n* One  example  from  my  own  experience  may  suffice.

' Science'  will  never  depersonalize,  or manipulate,  or  control  individuals. It  is  only  persons  who  can  and will do  that.  T hat is surely a most obvious and trite  observation,  yet a  deep  realization of it  has  had  much  meaning  for me. It  means  that the  use  which  will  be  made  of  scientific  findings  in  the  field  of  per­ sonality  is  and  will  be  a  matter  o f  subjective  personal  choice - the same type of choice as a person makes in therapy.  T o  the extent that he  has  defensively  closed  off  areas  of  his  experience  from  awareness, the  person  is more  likely  to make  choices which are socially  destruc­ tive.

The  instrument  was  a  crude  one,  but  it was a  better  predictor  than  measures  of  family environment,  hereditary  capaci­ ties,  social  milieu,  and  the  like. At  that  time  I  was  simply  not  ready  to  believe such  a  finding, because  my  own  belief,  like  that  of  most  psychologists,  was  that such  factors  as  the  emotional  climate  in  the  family  and  the influence  of  the peer  group  were  the  real  determinants  of  fumre  delinquency  and  non-delin­ quency. Only  gradually',  as  my  experience  with  psychotherapy  continued  and deepened,  was  it  possible  for  me  to  give  my  tentative  belief  to  the  findings  of this  study  and  of  a  later  one  (1944)  which  confirmed  it. (For a  report  of  these two  studies  see  'The  role  of  self-understanding  in  the  prediction  of  behavior' by  C.  R.  Rogers,  B.  L.  Kell,  and  II.  M cNeil,  /.  Consult.  Psychol.,  12,  1948,  pp. 17+- 1S6.\n· I  have  spelled  out  more  fully  the  rationale  for this  view  in  another  paper 'Toward a Theory of Creativity.'\nthreatening  and  dangerous  in  their  defensiveness,  and  modern  sci­ entific  knowledge  multiplies  the  social  threat  and  danger,  this  is  not the whole picture.  There are two other significant facets. (1)  There are  many  persons  who  are  relatively  open  to  their  experience  and hence  likely  to  be  socially  constructive. (2) Both  the  subjective experience  of  psychotherapy  and  the  scientific  findings  regarding it indicate  that  individuals  are  motivated  to  change,  and  may  be helped  to change,  in  the  direction  of  greater  openness  to  experience, and hence in the direction of behavior which is enhancing of self and society, rather than destructive.\nTo put it briefly, Science can  never threaten  us. Only persons can do  that. And  while  individuals  can  be  vastly  destructive  with  the tools placed  in  their  hands  by  scientific  knowledge,  this  is  only  one side of the picture.

        "text": "What this  line  of  thought  has  achieved  for  me  is  a  fresh  integra­ tion  in which  the  conflict  between  the ' experientialist' and  the ' scientist' tends to  disappear.  This particular integration may  not be acceptable to others, but it does have meaning to me.  Its major tenets have  been  largely  implicit  in  the  preceding section,  but  I  will  try  to state  them  here  in  a  way  which  takes  cognizance  of  the  arguments between the opposing points of view.\nScience,  as  well  as  therapy,  as  well  as  all  other  aspects  of  living, is rooted in and based upon the immediate, subjective experience  of a person. It  springs  from  the  inner, total, organismic  experiencing which  is  only  partially  and  imperfectly  communicable. It is one phase of subjective living.\nIt  is  because  I  find  value  and  reward  in  human  relationships  that I  enter  into  a  relationship  known  as  therapeutic,  where  feelings  and cognition  merge  into  one  unitary  experience  which  is  lived  rather\nthan  examined,  in  which  awareness  is  non-reflective,  and  w T here  I am participant rather than observer. But because  I  am curious about the exquisite  orderliness which appears  to  exist in the universe and  in this  relationship  I  can  abstract  myself  from  the  experience  and  look upon  it  as  an  observer,  making  myself  and/or  others  the  objects  of that  observation. As  observer  I  use  all  o f  the  hunches  which  grow out of the  living  experience. To avoid deceiving myself as observer, to gain a more accurate picture  of the order which exists, I make use of all  the  canons of science. Science  is  not  an impersonal something, but simply  a person  living subjectively  another  phase  of  himself. A deeper  understanding  of  therapy  (or  of  any  other  problem)  may come  from  living  it,  or  from  observing  it  in  accordance  with  the rules of science, or  from  the  communication  within  the self between the  two  types  of  experience. As  to  the  subjective  experience  of choice, it  is not only primary in therapy,  but it is also primary in  the use of scientific method by a person.\nWhat  I  will  do  with  the  knowledge  gained  through  scientific method - whether  I  will  use  it  to  understand,  enhance,  enrich,  or use  it  to  control,  manipulate  and  destroy -  is  a  matter  of  subjec­ tive  choice  dependent  upon  the  values  which  have  personal  mean­ ing for me.  If, out of fright and  defensiveness,  I  block out  from  my awareness  large  areas  of  experience, - if  I  can  see  only  those  facts which  support  my  present  beliefs,  and  am  blind  to  all  others - if  I can  see  only  the  objective  aspects  of  life,  and  cannot  perceive  the subjective - if  in  any  way  I  cut  off  my  perception  from  the  full range  of  its  actual  sensitivity - then  I  am  likely  to  be  socially  de­ structive,  whether  I  use  as  tool  the  knowledge  and  instruments  of science,  or  the  power  and  emotional  strength  of  a  subjective  rela­ tionship.  And on the  other  hand  if I  am open to  my  experience,  and can  permit  all  of  the  sensings  of  m y  intricate  organism  to  be  avail­ able  to  my  awareness,  then  I  am  likely  to  use  myself,  my  subjective experience,  and my  scientific  knowledge,  in  ways which  are  realisti­ cally constructive.\nThis  then  is  the  degree  of  integration  I  have  currently  been  able to  achieve  between  two  approaches  first  experienced  as  conflicting. It  does  not  completely  resolve  all  the  issues  posed  in  the  earlier  sec­\ntion,  but  it  seems  to  point toward a  resolution. It  rewrites  the  prob­ lem  or  rcperceives  the  issue,  by  putting  the  subjective,  existential person,  with  the  values  which  he  holds,  at  the  foundation  and  the root of the therapeutic  relationship  and  of  the  scicntific  relationship. For science  too,  at  its  inception,  is  an  ' I-Thou'  relationship  with  a person  or  persons. And  only as  a  subjective  person  can  I  enter into either of these relationships.\n11\nPersonality  Change in  Psychotherapy\n%\nT he  paper  'which  follows  gives  a  few  of  the  salient  features  of  a very large scale research carried on at  the  University  of Chicago Counseling  Center  from  1950-1954,  viade  possible  by  the  generous support  of the  Rockefeller Foundation,  through its Medical Sciences Division. 1  was  invited  to  present  a  paper  to  the  Fifth  International Congress  on  Mental  Health  in  Toronto,  in  1954,  and  chose  to  attempt to  describe  certain portions  of that program. Within a viomh of  the  delivery  of  this  paper,  our  book  describing  the  whole  pro­ gram  was  published  by  the  University  of  Chicago  Press. Although Rosalind Dymond and 1 served as editors as well as authors of certain portions  of the  book,  the  other  authors  deserve  equal  credit  for  the book and for  the vast amount  of work  from which  this  paper skims a  few of the more striking points. These other authors are:  John  M. Butler,  Desmond  Cartwright,  Thomas  Gordon,  Donald  L.  Grw/:mon,  Gerard  V.  Haigh,  Eve  S.  John,  Esselyn  C.  RvdikofJ,  Julws Seeman, Rolland R. Tonyas, and Manuel J.  Vargas.\nA  special  reason  for  including  this  presentation  in  this  volume  L that it gives in brief form some of the exciting progress we have made in  the  measurement  of  that  changing,  nebulous,  highly  significant and determining aspect of personality, the self.\nI t  is t h e   p u r p o se   o f  this  paper  to  present  some  o f  the  high  lights of  the experience  which  I  and  my  colleagues  have  had  as  we endeavored  to  measure,  by  objective  scientific  methods,  the  out­ comes  of  one  form  of  individual  psychotherapy. In  order  to  make these  high  lights  understandable,  I  shall  describe  briefly  the  context in  wr hich  this  research  undertaking  has  been  carried  on.\nFor many  years I  have  been  working,  with  my  psychologist  col­ leagues,  in the  field of  psychotherapy. We  have  been  trying  to learn,  from  our  experience  in  carrying  on  psychotherapy,  what  is effective  in  bringing  about  constructive  change  in  the  personality and  behavior  of  the  maladjusted  or  disturbed  person  seeking  help. Gradually we  have formulated an approach  to psychotherapy, based upon this experience,  which  has  variously been  termed non-directive or client-centered. This approach  and  its theoretical  rationale  have\nbeen described in a number of books  (1, 2, 5,  6,  8)  and many articles. It  has  been  one  of  our  persistent  aims  to  subject  the  dynamics  of therapy and the results of therapy  to  rigorous  research  investigation. It  is  our  belief  that  psychotherapy  is  a  deeply  subjective  existential experience  in  both  client  and  therapist,  full  of  complex  subtleties, Yet  it  is  also our  conviction  that  if  this  experience  is  a  significant  one,  in  which deep  learnings  bring  about  personality  change,  then  such  changes\nand  involving  many  nuances  of  personal  interaction. should be amenable to research investigation.\nOver  the  past  fourteen  years  we  have  made  many  such  research studies, of  both the process  and the outcomes  of  this form  of therapy. (Sec  5,  particularly  chapters  2,  4,  and  7,  for  a  summarized account of this body of research.) During the  past five years,  at the Counseling Center of the  University of Chicago, we  have been push­ ing  forward  the  boundaries  of  such  research  by  means  of  a  co­ ordinated  series  of  investigations  designed  to  throw  light  upon  the outcomes of this  form of psychotherapy.  It is  from  this  current re­ search  program  that  I  wish  to  present  certain  significant  features.",

        "text": "What  is  the  criterion  for  research  in  psychotherapy? This  is  a most perplexing issue which we faced early in our planning.  There is widespread  acceptance  of  the  idea  that  the  purpose  of  research  in this  field  is  to  measure  the  degree  o f  ' success'  in  psychotherapy,  or the degree of 'cure' achieved.  While we have not been uninfluenced by  such  thinking,  we  have,  after  careful  consideration, given  up these  concepts  because  they  are  undefinable,  are  essentially  value judgments,  and  hence  cannot  be  a  part  of  the  science  of  this  field. There  is  no  general  agreement  as  to  what  constitutes  'success' whether it is removal  of symptoms,  resolution  of  conflicts,  improve­ ment in social behavior, or some other type of change.  The  concept of  'cure'  is  entirely  inappropriate,  since  in  most  of  these  disorders we are dealing with learned behavior, not with a disease.\nAs  a  consequence  of  our  thinking,  we  have  not  asked  in  our  re­ search,  ' W as  success  achieved? Was the  condition  cured?' Instead we  have  asked  a  question  which  is  scientifically  much more  de­ fensible, namely, 'W hat are the concomitants of therapy?'\nIn  order to  have a basis for  answering  this question  we  have  taken the  theory  of  psychotherapy  w'hich  we  have  been  developing  and have  drawn  from  it  the  theoretical  description of those  changes which we hypothesized as occurring in therapy.  The purpose of the research is to determine whether the  changes which are hypothesized do  or  do  not  occur  in measurable  degree. Thus  from  the  theory  of client-centered  therapy  wre  have  drawrn  hypotheses  such  as  these: during therapy feelings which have previously been denied to aware­ ness  are  experienced,  and  are  assimilated  into  the  concept  of  self; during therapy the concept of the self becomes more congruent with the  concept  of  the  ideal  self;  during  and  after  therapy  the  observed behavior  of  the  client  becomes  more  socialized  and  mature;  during and  after  therapy  the  client  increases  in  attitudes  of  self-acceptance, and  this  is  correlated  with  an  increase  in  acceptance  of  others.\nThese  are  a  few  of  the  hypotheses  we  have  been  able  to  investi­ gate. It  will  perhaps  be  clear  that  we  have  abandoned  entirely  the idea  of  one  general  criterion  for  our  studies,  and  have  substituted instead a number of clearly defined  variables, each one specific to the hypothesis  being  investigated. This  means  that  it  was  our  hope  in the  research  to  be  able  to  state  our  conclusions  in  some  such  form as this: that client-centered psychotherapy  produces measurable changes  in  characteristics  a,  b,  d,  and  f,  for  example,  but  does  not produce  changes  in  variables  c  and  e. When statements  of  this  sort are available then  the professional worker and the layman will be in a position  to  make  a  value  judgment  as  to  whether  he  regards  as  a ' success' a process  which produces  these changes. Such value judgments  will  not,  however,  alter  the solid facts in our  slowly growing  scientific  knowledge  of  the  effective  dynamics  of  person­ ality change.\nThus in our research we have, in place of the usual global criterion of 'success,' many specific  criterion  variables, each  drawn  from  our theory of therapy, and each operationally defined.\nThis  resolution  of  the  problem  of  criteria  was  of  great  help  in making  an  intelligent  selection  of  research  instruments  to  use  in  our battery  of  test. We  did  not  ask  the  unanswerable  question  as  to what instruments would measure success or cure.  W e asked  instead, specific  questions  related  to  each  hypothesis. What  instrument  can",

        "text": "The fact that there has been no  objective  evidence of constructive personality change brought about by psychotherapy, has been mentioned  by  a  number  of  thoughtful  writers. Hebb  states  that ' there  is  no  body  of  fact  to  show  that  psychotherapy  is  valuable' (4,  p.  271). Eysenck,  after  surveying  some  of  the  available  studies, points  out  that  the  data  ' fail  to  prove  that  psychotherapy,  Freudian or  otherwise,  facilitates  the  recovery  of  neurotic  patients' (3, p. 322).\nMindful  of  this  regrettable  situation  we  were  eager  to  set  up  our investigation  in  a  sufficiently  rigorous  fashion  that  the  confirmation or  disproof  of  our  hypotheses  would  establish  two  points: (a)  that significant change had or had not occurred, and  (b)  that such change, if it did occur, was attributable to the  therapy  and  not to some  other factor. In  such  a  complex  field  as  therapy  it  is  not  easy  to  devise  a research design which will accomplish these aims, but we believe that we have made real progress in this direction.\nHaving  chosen  the  hypotheses  which  we  wished  to  test,  and  the instruments  most  suitable  for  their operational measurement,  we were  now  ready  for  the  next step. This  selected  scries  of  objective research  instruments  were  used  to  measure  various  characteristics of  a  group  of  clients  before  their  therapy,  after  the  completion  of therapy,  and  at  a  followup  point  six  months  to  one  year  later,  as indicated  in  Figure 1. The  clients  were  roughly  typical  of  those coming  to  the  Counseling Center of  the  University  of  Chicago,  and the  aim  was to  collect  this  data,  including  the  recording  of  all  inter­ views,  for  at  least  25  clicnts. The  choice  was  made  to  make  an  in­ tensive  study of a group  of  moderate size,  rather  than  a more super­ ficial analysis of a larger number.\nA  part  of  the therapy  group  was  set  aside as an  own-control group. This  group  was  given  the  battery  of  research  instruments, asked  to  wait  during  a  two  month  control  period,  and  then  given the  battery  a  second  time  before  counseling. The  rationale  of  this procedure is that if change occurs in individuals simply because  they are  motivated  for  therapy,  or  because  they  have  a  certain  type  of personality  structure,  then  such  change  should  occur  during  this control period.\nAnother  group  of  individuals  not  in  therapy  was  selected  as  an equivalent-control  group.  This group  was equivalent in age and  age distribution  to  the  therapy  group,  and  roughly  equivalent  in  socio­ economic status,  in  the  proportion  of  men  and  women,  and  of  stu­ dents  and  non-students.  This  group  was  given  the  same  tests  as  the therapy  group,  at  matched  time  intervals. A  portion  of  this  group was given the test battery  four times,  in  order  to make  them  strictly\ncomparable to the own-control  therapy group.  The  rationalt of this equivalent-control  group  is  that  if  change  occurs  in  individuals  as the  result  of  the  passage  of  time,  or  the  influence  of  random  vari­ ables,  or  as  an  artifact  of  the  repeated  administration  of  tests,  then such change  should  be  evident  in  the  findings  from  this  group.\nThe  over-all  logic  of  this  doubly  controlled  design  is  that  if  the therapy  group  shows  changes  during  and  after  the  therapy  period which  are  significantly  greater  than  those  which  occur  in  the  owncontrol  period  or  in  the  equivalent-control  group,  then  it  is  reason­ able to attribute these changes to the influence of the therapy.\nI  cannot,  in  this  brief  report,  go  into  the  complex  and  ramified details  of  the  various  projects  which  were  carried  out  within  the framework  of  this  research  design. A  more  complete  account  (7) has been prepared which describes thirteen of the projects completed thus  far. Suffice  to  say  that  complete  data  on  29  clients,  dealt  with by  16 therapists,  was obtained, as well as complete  data  on a matched control group. The  careful evaluation of the research findings enables us to  draw  certain  conclusions  such  as  these:  That profound changes  occur  in  the  perceived  self  of  the  client  during  and  after therapy;  that there  is  constructive  change  in  the  client's  personality characteristics  and  personality  structure,  changes  which  bring  him closer  to  the  personality characteristics  of the  well-functioning  per­ son; that  there  is change  in  directions  defined  as  personal  integration and adjustment; that there are  changes  in the maturity  of the client's behavior  as  observed  by  friends. In  each instance the  change is significantly  greater  than  that  found  in  the  control  group  or  in  the clients  during  the  own-control  period. Only  in  regard  to  the  hy­ potheses  having  to  do  with  acceptant  and  democratic  attitudes  in relation to others  are the findings  somewhat  confused  and am­ biguous.\nIn  our  judgment,  the  research  program  which  has  already  been completed  has  been  sufficient  to  modify  such  statements  as  those made by  Hebb and  Eysenck. In  regard  to  client-sponsored  psycho­ therapy, at  least,  there  is now objective  evidence  of  positive  changes in  personality and  behavior  in  directions which  are  usually  regarded as constructive  and  these  changes  arc  attributable  to  the  therapy. It is the  adoption  of multiple specific  research  criteria  and  the  use  of a\nrigorously  controlled  research  design  which  makes  it  possible  to make such a statement.",

        "text": "Since  I  can  only  present  a  very  small  sample  of  the  results,  I  will select  this sample  from  the  area  in  which  we  feel  there  has  been  the most significant  advance  in  methodology,  and  the  most  provocative findings,  namely,  our  attempts to  measure  the  changes in  the  client's perception of himself,  and  the  relationship  of self-perception  to  cer­ tain other variables.\nIn  order  to  obtain  an  objective  indication  of  the  client's  self-per­ ception,  we  made  use  of  the  newly  devised  Q-technique,  developed by Stephenson  (9).  A  large  ' universe'  of  self-descriptive  statements was drawn  from  recorded  interviews and  other sources. Some  typi­ cal  statements  are: ' I am  a  submissive  person' ;  ' I  don't  trust  my emotions' ;  ' I  feel  relaxed  and  nothing  bothers  me' ;  'I  am  afraid  of sex' ;  ' I  usually  like  people' ;  ' I  have  an  attractive  personality' ;  ' I am  afraid  of  what  other  people  think  of  me.'  A  random  sample  of one  hundred of these,  edited  for clarity,  was  used  as  the  instrument. Theoretically we now had a sampling of all the ways in which  an  in­ dividual  could  perceive  himself. These  hundred  statements,  each printed  on  a  card,  were  given  to  the  client. He  was  asked  to  sort the  cards  to  represent  himself  'as  of  now,'  sorting  the  cards  into nine  piles  from  those  items  most  characteristic  of  himself  to  those least  characteristic. He  was  told  to  place  a  certain  number  of items in  each pile so  as to  give an  approximately  normal distribution of the items.  The  client  sorted  the  cards  in  this  way  at  each  of  the  major points,  before  therapy,  after,  and  at  the  followup  point,  and  also  on several occasions during therapy. Each time  that he sorted  the cards to  picture  himself  he  was  also  asked  to  sort  them  to  represent  the self he would like to be, his ideal self.\nWe thus  had  detailed  and  objective  representations  of  the  client's self-pcrception at various  points,  and  his  perception  of  his  ideal  self. These various sortings were  then  inter-correlated,  a  high  correlation between  two  sortings  indicating  similarity  or  lack  of  change,  a  low correlation  indicating  a  dissimilarity,  or  a  marked  degree  of  change.\nIn order to  illustrate  the  way in which this instrument was used  to\ntest some  of our hypotheses in regard  to  the  self,  I  am  going  to  pre­ sent some  of  the  findings  from  the  study  of  one  client  (from  7,  ch. 15)  as  they  relate  to  several  hypotheses. I believe  this  will  indicate the provocative nature of the results more adequately  than presenting the  general  conclusions  from  our  study  of  self-perception,  though I  will  try  to  mention  these  generalized  results  in  passing.\nThe  client  from  whose  data  I  will  draw  material  was  a  woman of  40,  most  unhappy  in  her  marriage. Her  adolescent  daughter  had had  a  nervous  breakdown,  about  which  she  felt  guilty. She  was  a rather deeply  troubled  person  who was rated  on  diagnostic measures as  seriously  neurotic. She  was  not  a  member  of  the  own-control group,  so  entered  therapy  immediately  after  taking  the  first  battery of  tests. She  came  for  40  interviews  over  a  period  of  5 /2 months, when  she  concluded  therapy. Followup  tests  wrere administered seven  months  later,  and  at  that  time  she  decided  to  come  in  for  8 more interviews.  A second followup study  was done  5  months later. The  counselor  judged  that  there  had  been  very  considerable  move­ ment in therapy.\nFigure  2  presents  some  of  the  data  regarding  the  changing  selfperception  of  this  client. Each  circle  represents  a  sorting  for  the ideal  self  or  the  self. Sortings  were  done  before  therapy,  after  the seventh  and  twenty-fifth  interviews,  at  the  end  of  therapy,  and  at the first and  second  followup  points. The  correlations  are  given  be­ tween many of these sortings.\nLet us now examine this data in  reference to one  of the hypotheses which we  were  interested  in  testing,  namely,  that  the  perceived  self of the  client  will  change  more  during  therapy  than  during  a  period of no  therapy. In  this  particular  case  the  change  was  greater  during therapy (r  =   .39) than during either of the followup periods ( r = 7 4 , .70) or the whole twelve month period of followup (r  =   .65). Thus  the  hypothesis  is  upheld  in  this  one  case. In  this respect she was characteristic of our clients, the general finding being that the change in the perceived self during therapy was significantly greater than during the control or followup periods, and significantly greater  than  the  change  occurring  in  the  control  group.\nLet  us  consider  a  second  hypothesis. It  was  predicted  that  during and after therapy the perceived self would be more positively valued,\nFigure  2 The  changing  relationships  between  Self  and  Self-Ideal\ni.e., would  become  more  congruent  with  the  ideal,  or  valued,  self. This  client  exhibits  considerable  discrepancy  between  the  self  she is and the  self she would like to be, when  she first comes  in (r  =   .21). During and after therapy this discrepancy decreases, a de­ cided  degree  of  congruence  existing  at  the  final  followup  study (r =   .79),  thus  confirming  our  hypothesis. This  is  typical  of  our general  findings,  which  showed  a  significant  increase  in  congruence between self and ideal,  during therapy,  for the  group as  a whole.\nClose  study  of  Figure  2  will  show  that  by  the  end  of  our  study, the  client  perceives  herself  as  having  become  very  similar  to  the person  she  wanted  to  be  when  she  came  in  (rIB'SF2  =  .70). It  may also  be  noted  that  her  final  self-ideal  became  slightly  more  similar to her initial self  (rSB*IF2  =   .36)  than was her initial ideal.\nLet us briefly  consider  another  hypothesis,  that  the  change  in  the perceived  self  will  not  be  random,  but  will  be  in  a  direction  which expert judges would term adjustment.\nAs one part of our study the  Q-sort  cards  were  given  to  a  group of  clinical  psychologists  not  associated  with  the  research,  and  they were  asked  to  sort  the  cards  as  they  would  be  sorted  by  a  ' well-ad­ justed' person-  This gave  us a  criterion sorting with which  the sclfperception  of  any  client  could  be  compared. A  simple  score  was developed  to  express  the  degree  of  similarity  between  the  client's self-perception and  this representation of the 'adjusted'  person. This  was  called  the  'adjustment  score,'  higher  scores  indicating  a higher degree of 'adjustment.'\nIn  the  case  o f  the  client  we  have  been  considering  the  adjustment scores  for  the  six  succcssive  self-sorts  shown  in  Figure  2,  beginning with  the  self  as  perceived  before  therapy,  and  ending  at  the  second followup  point,  are  as  follows: 35,  44,  41, 52, 54, 51. The  trend toward  improved  adjustment,  as  operationally  defined,  is  evident This  is  also  true  for  the  group  as  a  whole,  a  marked  increase  in adjustment score  occurring  over  the  period  of  therapy,  and  a  very slight  regression  in  score  during  the  followup  period. There  was essentially no  change  in  the  control  individuals. Thus,  both for this  particular  client,  and  for  the  group  as  a  w  hole,  our  hypothesis is upheld.\nWhen  a  qualitative  analysis  of  the  different  self-sorts  is  made,\nthe  findings  further  confirm  this  hypothesis. When  the  initial  self­ picture  is  compared  with  those  after  therapy,  it  is  found  that  after therapy  the  client sees herself as  changed  in  a  number  of ways. She feels  she  is  more  self-confident  and  self-reliant,  understands  herself better,  has  more  inner  comfort,  and  more  comfortable  relationships with  others. She  feels  less  guilty,  less  resentful,  less  driven  and  in­ secure,  and  feels  less  need  for  self-concealment. These  qualitative changes  are  similar  to  those  shown  by  the  other  clients  in  the  re­ search  and  are  in  general  in  accord  with  the  theory  of  client-ccntercd therapy.\n1 should  like  to  point  out  certain  additional  findings  of  interest which arc illustrated in Figure 2.\nIt  will  be  evident  that  the  representation  of  the  ideal  self is  much more  stable  than  the  representation  of  the  self. The  inter-corrclations  are  all  above  .70,  and  the  conception  of  the  person  she  would like  to  be  changes  relatively  little  over  the  whole  period. This  is characteristic  of  almost all  of  our clients. While we had  formulated no  hypothesis  on  this  point  it  had  been  our  expectation  that  some clients  would  achieve  greater  congruence  of self  and  ideal  primarily through  alteration  of  their  values,  others  through  the  alteration  of self. Our  evidence  thus  far  indicates  that  this  is  incorrect,  and  that with  only  occasional  exceptions,  it  appears  to  be  the  concept  of  the self which exhibits the greater change.\nSome change,  however,  does  occur  in  the  ideal  self  in  the  case  of our  client  and  the  direction  of  this  slight  change  is  of  interest. If we  calculate  the previously  described ' adjustment  score' of  the successive  representations  of  the  ideal  self  of  this  client,  we find that  the  average  score  for  the  first  three  is  57,  but  the  average  of the  three  following  therapy  is  51. In  other  words  the  self-ideal  has become  less  perfectly  ' adjusted,'  or  more  attainable. It  is  to  some degree  a  less  punishing  goal. In  this  respect  also,  this  client  is  char­ acteristic of the trend in  the whole group.\nAnother  finding  has  to  do  with  the  ' remembered  self*  which  is shown  in  Figure  2. This sorting  was  obtained  by  asking  the  client, at  the  time  of  the  second  followup  study,  to  sort  the  cards  once more  to  represent  herself  as  she  was  when  she  first  entered  therapy. This  remembered  self turned  out to  be  very  different from  the  selfpicture  she  had  given  at  the  time  of  entering  therapy. It  correlated\nonly  .44  with  the  self-representation  given  at  that  time. Further­ more,  it  was  a  much  less  favorable  picture  of  her  self,  being  far more discrepant from her ideal  (r  =   -.21), and having a low adjust­ ment score - a score  of  26  compared  to  a  score  of  35  for  the  initial self-picture. This  suggests  that  in  this  sorting  for  the  remembered self we have a crude objective measure of the  reduction  in  defensive­ ness  which  has  occurred  over  the  eighteen-month  period  of  our study. At  the  final  contact  she  is  able  to  give  a  considerably  truer picture  of  the  maladjusted  and  disturbed  person  that  she  was  when she  entered therapy, a picture which  is confirmed by other evidence, as  we  shall  see. Thus  the  degree  of  alteration  in  the  self  over  the total  period  of a  year  and  a  half  is  perhaps  better  represented  by  the correlation  of  -.13  between  the  remembered  self  and  the  final  self, than by the correlation of .30 between the initial and final self.\nLet  us  now  turn  to  a  consideration  of  one  more  hypothesis. In client-centered  therapy our theory is that in the  psychological safety of  the  therapeutic  relationship the  client is able to permit  in his awareness  feelings  and  experiences  which  ordinarily  would  be  re­ pressed,  or denied to awareness.  These previously denied experiences now  become  incorporated  into  the  self. For  example,  a  client  who has  repressed  all  feelings  of  hostility  may  come,  during  therapy,  to experience  his  hostility  freely. His concept of himself then becomes reorganized  to  include  this  realization  that  he  has,  at  times,  hostile feelings  toward  others. His  self-picture  becomes  to  that  degree  a more  accurate  map  or  representation  of  the  totality  of  his  experi­ ence.\nWe  endeavored  to  translate  this  portion  of  our  theory  into  an operational  hypothesis, which we  expressed  in  this  way:  During and after  therapy  there  will  be  an  increasing  congruence  between  the self  as perceived  by  the  client  and  the  client  as perceived  by  a diagnostician.  The assumption  is  that a  skilled  person  making  a  psy­ chological diagnosis  of the client  is  more  aware of the totality of the client's  experience  patterns,  both  conscious  and  unconscious,  than is  the  client. Hence  if  the  client  assimilates  into  his  own  conscious self-picture  many  of  the  feelings  and  experiences  which  previously he  has  repressed,  then  his  picture  of  himself  should  become  more similar to the picture which the diagnostician has of him.\nThe  method  of  investigating  this  hypothesis  was  to  take  the  pro­\njective  test  (the  Thematic  Apperception  Test)  which  had  been  ad­ ministered  to  the  client  at  each  point  and  have  these  four  tests examined  by  a  diagnostician. In  order  to  avoid  any  bias,  this  psy­ chologist was not told the order in which  the  tests had  been adminis­ tered. He  was  then  asked  to  sort  the  Q-cards  for  each  one  of  the tests  to  represent  the  client  as  she  diagnostically  was  at  that  time. This procedure  gave  us an  unbiased  diagnostic  evaluation,  expressed in  terms  of  the  same  instrument  as  the  client  had  used  to  portray herself, so that a direct and  objective comparison  was  possible, through correlation of the different Q-sorts.\nThe  result  of  this  study,  for  this  particular  client,  is  shown  in Figure  3. The  upper  portion  of  this  diagram  is  simply  a  condensa­ tion  of  the  information  from  Figure  2. The  lowest  row  shows  the sortings  made  by  the  diagnostician,  and  the  correlations  enable  us to  test  our  hypothesis. It  will  be  observed  that  at  the  beginning  of therapy  there  is  no  relationship  between  the  client's  perception  of herself  and  the  diagnostician's  perception  of  the  client (r =   .00). Even  at  the  end  of  therapy  the  situation  is  the  same  (r =   .05). But by  the  time  of  the first followup (not  shown) and  the  second followup,  the  client's  perception  of  herself  has  become  substantially like  the  diagnostician's  perception  of  her (first  followup,  r =  .56; second  followup,  r =   .55). Thus  the  hypothesis  is  clearly  upheld, congruence  between  the  self  as  perceived  by  the  client  and  the\nclient  as  perceived  by  a  diagnostician  having  significantly  increased. There  are  other  findings  from  this  aspect  of  the  study  which  are of  interest. It  will  be  noted  that  at  the  time  of  beginning  therapy the  client  as  perceived  by  the  diagnostician  is  very  dissimilar  to  the ideal  she  had  for  herself  (r =   -  .42). By  the  end  of  the  study  the diagnostician  sees  her  as  being  decidedly  similar  to  her  ideal  at  that time  (r =   .46)  and  even  more  similar  to  the  ideal  she  held  for  her­ self  at  the  time  she  came  in  (r =   .61). Thus  we  may  say  that  the objective evidence indicates that the client has become, in her self-perception  and  in  her  total  personality  picture,  substantially  the person she wished to become when she entered therapy.\nAnother noteworthy point is that the change in  the  diagnostician's perception  of  the  client  is  considerably  sharper  than  is  the  change in  the  perceived  self  of  the  client  (r  =   -.33,  compared  with  r  of\nFigure  3 Relationship  between  Self,  Self-Ideal,  and  Diagnosis (Figures are  correlations , decimal points omitted)\n.30). In  view  of  the  common  professional  opinion  that  clients  over­ rate  the  degree  of  change  they  have  undergone,  this  fact  is  of  in­ terest. The  possibility is also suggested that an individual may change  so  markedly  over  a  period  of  eighteen  months  that  at  the conclusion his personality ii more  dissimilar than similar to his personality at the outset.\nOne  last  comment  on  Figure  3  is  in  relation  to  the  ' remembered self.' It  will  be  noted  that  this  remembered  picture  of  the  self  cor­ relates positively with the diagnostic  impression  (r  =   .30),  thus tend­ ing  to  confirm  the  previous  statement  that  it  represents  a  more  ac­ curate  and  less  defensive  picture  than  the  client  was  able  to  give  of herself at the time she entered therapy.",

        "text": "In this paper I  have  endeavored  to  indicate  at  least  a  skeleton  out­ line of the comprehensive investigation of psychotherapy now  going forward  at  the  University  of  Chicago. Several  features  have  been mentioned.\nFirst  is  the  rejection  of  a  global  criterion  in  the  study  of  therapy, and the adoption of specific  operationally  defined  criteria  of change, based  upon  detailed  hypotheses  growing  out  of  a theory  of  the dynamics  of therapy.  The  use  of  many  specific  criteria  has  enabled us  to  make  scientific  progress  in  determining  the  types  of  change which do and do not occur concomitant with client-centered therapy.\nA  second  feature  is  a  new  approach  to  the  hitherto  unresolved problem  of  controls  in  studies  of  psychotherapy. The  research  de­ sign  has  included  two  control  procedures, (1) a matched  control group which accounts for the influence of time,  repeated  test-taking, and  random variables,  and  (2)  an  own-control  group  in  which  each client  in  therapy  is  matched  with  himself  during  a  period  of  no therapy,  in  order  to  account  for  the  influence  of  personality  varia­ bles  and  motivation. With  this  double-control  design  it  has  been possible  to  conclude  that  changes  during  therapy  which  are nor accounted  for  by  the  controlled  variables,  are  due  to  the  therapy itself.\nAnother  feature  selected  for  presentation  was  a  sample  of  the\nprogress  which  has  been  made  in  carrying  on  rigorous  objective investigation  of  subtle elements  of  the client's subjective world. Evidence  has been presented as to:  the  change  in  the self-concept of the  client;  the  degree  to  which  the  perceived self becomes similar  to the  valued  self;  the  extent  to  which  the  self  as  perceived  becomes more  comfortable and adjusted; and  the  degree to which  the  client's perception  of  self  becomes  more  congruent  with  a  diagnostician's perception of the client.  These findings tend  to confirm the theoreti­ cal  formulations  which  have  been  made  as  to  the  place  of  the  selfconcept in the dynamic process of psychotherapy.\nThere  are  two  conclusions  which  I  would  like  to  leave  with  you in  closing. The  first  is  that  the  research  program  I  have  described appears  to  make  it  quite  clear  that  objective  evidence,  meeting  the usual  canons  of rigorous  scientific investigation, can  be  obtained as to the personality  and  behavioral changes brought  about  by psychotherapy,  and  has  been  obtained  for  one  psychotherapeutic orientation. This  means  that  in the  future  similar  solid  evidence can  be  obtained  as  to  whether  personality  change  occurs  as  a  result of other psychotherapies.\nThe  second  conclusion  is  in  my  judgment  even  more  significant. The  methodological  progress  made  in  recent  years  means  that  the many  subtleties  of  the  therapeutic  process  are  now  wide  open  for research  investigation. I  have  endeavored  to  illustrate  this  from  the investigation  of  changes  in  the  self-concept. Rut  similar  methods make  it  equally  possible  to  study  objcctivclv  the  changing  relation­ ship between client and therapist, ' transference' and ' countertransference'  attitudes,  the  changing  source  of  the  client's  value system, and  the  like. I believe it may  be  said that almost  any theoretical  construct  which  is  thought  to  be  related  to  personality change  or  to  the  process  of  psychotherapy,  is  now  amenable  to research  investigation. This  opens  a  new  vista  of  scientific  investi­ gation. The  pursuit  of  this  new  path  should  throw  much  light  on the  dynamics  of  personality,  particularly on  the  proccss  of per­ sonality change  in an interpersonal relationship.",

This  was  the  task  which  was  set for me by  the  fact  that  Dr.  G.  Marian  Kinget and  1   were  writing  a book on client-centered  therapy  to  be published first in  Flemish and then  in French. Dr. Kinget  presented  the clinical principles of such  therapy. I presented  the  central  theories of client-centered therapy  (almost  identical  with  the  English  presentation,  A  Theory of  Therapy, Personality  and  Interpersonal Relationships,  in  S.  Koch {ed.) Psychology: A  Study  of  a  Science,  vol.  III. (New  York: McGraw-Hill, 1959),  184-256). 1  now wished  to  introduce  them  to the research  in which  we  had  engaged  to  confirm  or  disconfirm  our theories. This  chapter  (slightly  modified  for  this  volume) is the result,  and  I  hope  it  may have  meaning  for  Americans  as  well  as Europeans.\nIn  one  small  matter  I  beg  the  reader's  indulgence.

Thus I have tried  to present  at  least a  small sampling  of more than a score of years of research effort.\n&\nT he  S t im u la t io n of  R esearch\nOne  of  the  most  important  characteristics  of  the  client-centered orientation to therapy is that from the  first  it  has not only stimulated research  but  has  existed  in a contcxt  of  research thinking. The number and variety  of the  completed  studies  is  impressive. In  1953 Seeman and  Raskin  described  or  mentioned  nearly fifty  research  in­ vestigations  having  to  do  with  client-centered  therapy  with  adults, in  their critical  analysis  of the  trends  and  directions  of such  research (9). In 1957  Cartwright  published  an  annotated  bibliography  of research  and  theory  construction  in  client-centered  therapy,  and found  it  nccessary  to  include  122  references  (4). He,  like  Seeman and  Raskin,  omitted  all  references  having  to  do  with  research in play  therapy and  group  therapy  of  a  client-centered  nature. There seems  then  no  question  but  that  the  theory  and  practice  of  clientcentered therapy have set in motion a surprising number of objective empirical  investigations. It  seems  reasonable  to  ask  ourselves  why.\nIn  the  first  place  the  theory  of  client-centered  therapy  has  been seen  from  the  first  not  as  dogma  or  as  truth  but  as  a  statement  of hypotheses,  as  a  tool  for  advancing  our  knowledge. It has  been felt that a  theory,  or any  segment of a  theory,  is useful  only  if  it  can be put to test.  There has been a sense of commitment to the objective testing  of  each  significant  aspect  of  our  hypotheses,  believing  that the  only  way  in  which  knowledge  can  be  separated  from  individual prejudice  and  wishful  thinking  is  through  objective  investigation.\nTo he  objective  such  investigation  must  be  of  the  sort  that  another investigator collecting  the  data  in  the  same  wav and  performing  the same  operations  upon  it,  will  discover  the  same  or  similar  findings, and  come  to  the  same  conclusions. In  short  we  have  believed  from the  first  that  the  field  of  psychotherapy  will  be  advanced  bv  the open,  objective  testing  of  all  hypotheses  in  ways  which  are  pub­ licly communicable and  replicable.\nA  second  reason  for  the  stimulating  effect  of  the  client-centered approach upon research is the orienting attitude that scientific study  can  begin  anywhere,  at  any  level  of  crudity  or  refinement; that  it  is  a  direction,  not  a  fixed  degree  of  instrumentation. From this point  of  view, a recorded  interview  is  a  small beginning  in scientific  endeavor,  because  it  involves  greater  objectification  than the  memory  of  an  interview;  a  crude  conceptualization  of  therapy, and crude instruments for measuring these concepts, arc more scientific  than  no  such  attempt. Thus  individual  research  workers have  felt  that  they  could  begin  to  move  in  a  scientific  direction  in the areas of  greatest  interest  to  them. Out  of  this  attitude  has  come a  scries  of  instruments  of  increasing  refinement  for  analyzing  inter­ view'  protocols,  and  significant  beginnings  have  been  made  in  meas­ uring  such  seemingly  intangible  constructs  as  the  self-concept,  and the psychological climate of a therapeutic relationship.\nThis  leads  me  to  what  I  believe  to  be  the  third  major  reason  for the  degree  of  success  the  theory  has  had  in  encouraging  research. The  constructs  of  the  theory  have,  for  the  most  part,  been  kept  to those  which  can  be  given  operational  definition. This  has  seemed to  meet a  very pressing  need  for  psychologists  and  others  who  have wished  to  advance  knowledge  in  the  field  of  personality,  but  who have  been  handicapped  by  theoretical  constructs  which  cannot  be defined  operationally. Take  for  example the  general phenomena encompassed in such terms as  the self,  the  ego,  the  person. If  a  con­ struct  is  developed - as  has  been  done  by  some  theorizers - w  hich includes  those inner  events  not  in  the  awareness  of  the  individual  as well  as  those  in  awareness,  then  there  is  no  satisfactory  way  at  the present  time  to  give  such  a  construct  an  operational  definition. But by  limiting the self-concept to  events in  awareness,  the  construct can be given increasingly refined operational definition through the\n246\nQ-technique,  the  analysis  of  interview  protocols,  etc.,  and  thus  a whole  area  of  investigation  is  thrown  open. In  time  the  resulting studies  may  make  it  possible  to  give  operational  definition  to  the cluster of events not in awareness.\nThe  use  of  operationally  definable  constructs  has  had  one  other effect. It has  made  completely  unnecessary  the  use  of  'success' and  ' failure' - two  terms  which  have  no  scientific  usefulness - as criteria  in  studies  of  therapy. Instead  of  thinking  in  these  global and  ill-defined  terms  research  workers can  make  specific  predictions in  terms  of  operationally  definable  constructs,  and  these  predictions can be  confirmed  or  disconfirmed,  quite  apart  from  any  value  judg­ ment  as  to  whether  the  change  represents  'success'  or  ' failure.' Thus one of the major barriers  to  scientific  advance  in  this  area  has been removed.\nAnother  reason  for  whatever  effectiveness  the  system  has  had  in mediating  research,  is  that  the  constructs  have  generality. Because psychotherapy  is  such  a  microcosm  of  significant  interpersonal  re­ lationship,  significant  learning,  and  significant  change  in  perception and  in  personality,  the  constructs  developed  to  order  the  field  have a  high  degree  of  pervasiveness. Such  constructs  as  the  self-concept, or  the need  for  positive  regard,  or  the  conditions  of  personality change,  all  have  application  to  a  wide  variety  of  human  activities. Hence  such  constructs may be  used  to study  areas  as  widely  variant as  industrial  or  military  leadership,  personality  change  in  psychotic individuals,  the  psychological  climate  of  a  family  or a  classroom,  or the inter-relation of psychological and physiological change.\nOne final fortunate circumstance deserves mention.  Unlike psycho­ analysis,  for  example,  client-centered  therapy  has  always  existed  in the context of a university setting.  This means a continual process of sifting  and  winnowing of  the  truth  from  the  chaff,  in  a  situation  of fundamental personal security. It means being exposed to the friendly criticism of colleagues,  in the  same  way that  new views  in  chemistry or biology or genetics  are subjected  to  critical  scrutiny. Most of  all it  means  that  the  theory  and  the  technique  are  thrown  open  to  the eager  searching  of  younger  minds. Graduate  students  question  and probe; they suggest  alternative  formulations;  they  undertake  empiri­",

From  a  limited  view point  largely  centered  on  technique,  with  no empirical  verification,  it  has  grown  to  a  ramifying  theory  of  per­ sonality  and  interpersonal  relations  as  well  as  of  therapy,  and  it  has collected  around  itself  a  considerable  body  of  replicable  empirical knowledge.",

Up  to 1940 there had  been  a  few  attempts to record therapeutic  interviews  electronically,  but  no  research  use  had  been made  of  such material. There had  been  no  serious  attempts  to utilize  the  methods  of  science  to  measure  the  changes  which  were thought  to  occur  in  therapy. So  we  are  speaking  of  a  field  w  hich is  still,  relatively  speaking,  in  its  sw'addling  clothes. But  a  beginning has been made.\nSometime  in  1940  a group  of us  at  Ohio  State  University  success­ fully  recorded  a  complete  therapeutic  interview. Our  satisfaction was  great,  but  it  quickly  faded. As  we  listened  to  tliis  material,  so formless,  so  complex,  wr e  almost  despaired  of  fulfilling  our  purpose of  using  it  as  the  data  for  research  investigations. It  seemed  almost impossible  to  reduce  it  to  elements  which  could  be handled  ob­ jectively.\nYet  progress  was  made. Enthusiasm  and  skill on the part of graduate students  made  up  for  the  lack  of  funds  and  suitable  equip­ ment. The  raw  data  of  therapy  was  transformed  by  ingenious  and creative  thinking  into  crude  categories  of  therapist  techniques  and equally  crude  categories  of  client  responses. Porter  analyzed  the therapist's  behavior  in  significant  ways. Snyder  analyzed  clicnt  re­ sponses  in several cases, discovering  some of the trends which existed. Others  were  equally  creative,  and  little  by  little  the  pos­ sibility of research in this field became a reality.\nThese  early  studies  were  often  unsophisticated,  often  faulty  in research  design, often  based upon  inadequate  numbers,  but  their contribution as an opening wedge wras nonetheless great.",

        "text": "In  1949  Raskin  (5)  completed  a  study  concerned  with  the  per­ ceived  source  of values,  or the  locus  of  the  evaluating  process. This started  from  the  simple  formulation  that  the  task  of  the  counselor was  not  to  think  for  the  client,  or  about  the  client,  but  with  the client. In  the  first  two  the  locus  of  evaluation  clearly  resides  in  the counselor,  but  in  the  last  the  counselor  is  endeavoring  to  think  and empathize  with  the  client  within  the  latter's  own  frame  of  refer­ ence, respecting the client's own valuing process.\nThe  question  Raskin  raised  was  wT hether  the  client's perceived locus of evaluation changed  during  therapy.  Putting it  more  specifi­ cally,  is there  a  decrease  in  the  degree  to  which  his  values  and  stand­ ards  depend  upon  the  judgments  and  expectations  of  others,  and  an increase  in  the  extent  to  which  his  values  and  standards  are  based upon a reliance upon his own experience?\nIn  order  to  study  this  objectively,  Raskin  undertook  the  follow­ ing steps.\n1. Three  judges  working  independently  were  asked  to  select,  in several  recorded  interviews,  those  statements  which  had  to  do  with the  source  of  the  client's  values  and  standards. It was  found  that there  was  more  than  80  per  cent  agreement  in  the  selection  of  such statements,  indicating  that  the  study  was  dealing  with  a  discrimin­ a t e  construct.\n2. Selecting  22  of these  items  to  represent a  wide  range  of  source of  values, Raskin  gave  these  items to 20 judges, asking  them  to distribute  these  statements  in  four  piles  according  to  the  continuum being  studied, with equal-appearing intervals between  the piles. Twelve of  the  items  rated  most  consistently  were  used  to  form  and illustrate  a  scale  of  locus  o f  evaluation,  with  values  from  1.0  to  4.0. Step  1 represented  an  unqualified  reliance  on  the  evaluations  made bv  others. Step  2 included  those  instances  in  which  there  was  a predominant  concern  with  what  others  think,  but  some  dissatis­ faction  with  this  state  of  dependence. Step  3 represented  those  ex­ pressions  in  which  the  individual  showed  as  much  respect  for  his own  valuing  process  as  for  the  values  and  expectations  of  others, and  showed  an  awareness  of  the  difference  between  self-evaluation and  dependence  on  others'  values. Step  4  was  reserved  for those  in­ stances in which  there was clear evidence of reliance  upon one's own experience and judgment as the basic source of values.\nAn example  illustrating  stage  3   may  give  a  more  vivid  picture  of this  scale. The following client  statement  was  rated  as  belonging  in this step of the scale.\n'So I've made a decision that I  wonder  if it  is  right. When you're in  a  family  where  your  brother  has  gone  to  college  and  everybody has a  good  mind,  I  wonder  if  it  is  right  to  sec  that  I  am  as  I  am  and I  can't  achieve  such  things. I've  always  tried  to  be  what  the  others thought  I  should  be,  but  now  I'm  wondering  whether  I  shouldn't just sec that I am what I am.' (6,  p.  151).\n3. Raskin  now  used  this  scale  to  rate  each  of  59  interviews  in  ten hricf but  fully  recorded  cases  which  had  been  made  the  subject  of other  research  investigations. After  he  had  made  these  ratings,  hut befcre  analyzing  them,  he  wished  to  determine  the  reliability  of  his judgments. Consequently  he  chose  at  random  one  item  relating  to locus  of  evaluation  from  each  of  the  59  interviews,  and  had  these rated  independently  by  another  judge  who  knew  nothing  of  the source  of  the  items,  or  whether  they  camc  from  early  or  late  in­ terviews. The  correlation  between  the  two  sets  of  ratings  was  .91, a  highly satisfactory  reliability.\n4. Having  constructed  a  scale  of  equal-appearing  intervals,  and having  demonstrated  that  it  was  a  reliable  instrument,  Raskin  was\nnow  ready  to  determine  whether  there  had  been  any  shift  in  the locus  of  evaluation  during  therapy. The  average  score  for  the  first interviews  in  the  ten  cases  was  1.97,  for  the  final  interviews  2.73, a  difference  significant  at  the  .01 level. Thus  the  theory  of  clicntcentered  therapy  on  this  point  was  upheld. A  further  confirmation was  available. These  10  cases  had  been  studied  in  other  objective wavs,  so  that  there  were  objective  criteria  from  other  studies  as  to which  cases  were  more,  and  which  less  successful. If  one  takes  the five  cases  judged  as  more  suiiessful,  the  shift  in  locus  of  evaluation in  these  cases  is  even  sharper,  the  average  for  the  first  interviews being 2.12, and for the final interviews 3.34.\nThis  study  is,  in  a  number  of  respects,  typical  of  a  large  group of  the  research  investigations  which  have  been  made. Starting  with one  of  the  hypotheses  of  client-centered  theory,  an  instrument  is devised  to  measure  varying  degrees  of  the  construct  in  question. The  instrument  is  then  itself  put  to  the  test  to  determine  whether it  does  in  fact  measure  what  it  purports  to  measure,  and  whether any qualified person can  use  it and  obtain  the  same  or similar  results. The instrument is then applied  to the data of therapy in  a way which can  be  shown  to  be  unbiassed. (In  Raskin's  case  the  checking  of 59  randomly  selected  items  by  another  judge  shows  that  bias,  con­ scious  or  unconscious,  did  not  enter  appreciably  into  his  ratings.) The  data  acquired  from  the use of the instrument  can  then  be analyzed  to  determine  whether  it  does  or  does  not  support  the  hy­ pothesis. In  this  case the hypothesis  was  upheld,  confirming  the theory  that  clients  in  client-centered  therapy  tend  to  decrease  in the  extent  to  which  they  rely  for  guidance  upon  the  values  and expectations  of  others,  and  that  they  tend  to  increase  in  reliance upon self-evaluations based upon their own experiences.\nAlthough  the  number  of  cases  studied  is  small,  and  the  therapy very  brief  (as  was  characteristic  o f  that  earlier  period) these  are the  only  major  flaws  in  this  study. It  is  probable  that  if  rcplicated on  a  larger  number  of  longer  cases  the  results  would  still  be  the same.  It marks an intermediate level of research sophistication, some­ where  between  the  very  crude  initial  studies,  and  the  more  meticu­ lously designed recent studies.\nT iie R elation  of  A uto nom ic  F unction  to  T herapy\nThetford  undertook  a  study  of  quite  a  different  sort,  also  com­ pleted  in  1949  (11). His  hypothesis  went  well  beyond  the  theory of  client-centered therapy, predicting  physiological consequences which  were  consistent  with  the  theory,  but  which  had  never  been formulated.\nBriefly  his  major  hypothesis  was  that  if  therapy  enables  the  indi­ vidual  to  reorient  his  pattern  of  life  and  to  reduce  the  tension  and anxiety  he  feels  regarding  his  personal  problems,  then  the  reactions of his  automatic nervous system  in,  for example,  a  situation  of stress, should  also  be  altered. Essentially  he  was  hypothesizing  that  if  a change  in  life  pattern  and  in  internal  tension  occurred  in  therapy, this  should  show  up  in  organismic  changes  in  autonomic  function­ ing,  an  area over  which  the  individual  has  no  conscious  control. Essentially  he  was  asking,  H ow  deep  are  the  changes  wrought  by client-centered  therapy? Are  they  deep  enough  to  affect  the  total organismic functioning of the individual?\nAlthough  his  procedure  was  decidedly  complex,  it  can  be  de­ scribed simply enough in  its essentials. A  therapy  group  of nineteen individuals  was  recruited,  composed  of  clients  coming to  the  Coun­ seling Center of  the  University  of  Chicago  for personal  help. They were  invited  to  volunteer  for  a  research  in  personality. Since  all who were  invited participated,  except a  few  who  could  not  arrange testing  appointments,  this was  a representative group  of  student clients from the Center. Ten individuals went into individual therapy,  three  into  individual  and  group  therapy  concurrently,  and six  into  group  therapy. A  control  group  of  seventeen  individuals not in therapy was  recruited,  roughly similar  in  age  and  cduc.1tion.1 l status to the therapy group.\nEvery  individual,  whether  therapy  or  control,  went  through  the same  experimental  procedure. The  most  significant  aspects  were these. The  individual  was  connected  by  suitable  clcctrodcs  to  a polygraph  which recorded his palmar  skin conductance (GSR), heart  rate,  and  respiration. After  a  rest  period  to  establish  a  base line,  the individual  was  told  that  memory  for  digits  was  a  good\nindex  of  intelligence,  and  thnr  the  experimenter  wished  to  test  him for  this. The  series  of  digits  used  was  increased  in  length  until  the individual  clearly  failed. After  a  two  minute rest, another  series was  used  to  bring  another  clear  failure. After  another  rest,  there was  another  frustrating  failure. Since  these  were  all  students,  the ego-involvement  and  the  frustration  were  clearly  real  since  the  ex­ perience  seemed  to  cast  doubt  on  their  intellectual  ability. After another  rest  period  the  individual  was  released,  but  informed  that he  would  be  called  back  at  a  later  time. At  no  time  was  there any hint that the experiment had anything to do with the  individual's therapy, and the testing was carried on in another building.\nFollowing  the  completion  of  therapy  the  clients  were recalled and went through the same  experimental procedure - three  episodes of  frustration  and  recovery,  with  continuous  autonomic  measure­ ments  being  made. At  matched  time  intervals,  the  controls  were also recalled and put through an identical procedure.\nVarious physiological  indices  were  computed  for  the  therapy  and control  groups.  The  only significant differences between  the  groups were differences  in  the  rapidity  of  recovery  from  frustration  on  the pre as compared with the post test.  In  general  it may be said  that the group which had therapy recovered from its frustration more quickly  on  the  post-test  than  on  the  pre-test,  while  for  the  control group  the  results  were  the  reverse. They  recovered  more  slowly at the time of the second series of frustrations.\nLet  me  make  this  more  specific. The  therapy  group  showed  a change  in  the  ' recovery  quotient'  based  on  the  G SR   which  was significant  at  the .02 level of confidence,  and  which  was  in  the direction of  more  rapid  recovery  from  frustration. The  control group showed  a  change in the ' recovery quotient' which was significant  at  the 10  per  cent  level,  and  w'as  in  the  direction  of  a slower  recovery. In  other  words  they  were  less  able  to  cope  with the  frustration  during  the  post-test  than  during  the  pre-test. An­ other  G SR measure,  'per  cent of recovery,' again  showed the therapy  group  making  a  more  rapid  recovery  at  the  second  test, a  change  significant  at  the  5  per  cent  level,  while  the  control  group showed no change.  As to  cardiovascular activity  the  therapy  group, on  the  average,  showed  less  heart-rate  variation  at  the  time  of  the\npost-test  frustration,  a  changc  significant  at the 5 per  cent  level. The control group showed no changc. Other indices showed changes consistent with those mentioned, hut not as significant.\nIn  general it may be said that  the  individuals who  had  experienced therapy developed a higher frustration threshold during their series of therapeutic contacts, and w ere  able to  recover their homeo­ static  balance  more  rapidly  following  frustration. In the  control group,  on  the  other  hand,  there  was  a  slight  tendency  toward  a lower  threshold  for  the  second frustration, and a definitely less rapid recovery of homeostasis.\nIn  simple  terms,  the  significance  of  this  study  appears  to  be  that after  therapy  the  individual  is  able  to  meet,  with  more  tolerance and  less  disturbance,  situations  of  emotional  stress  and  frustration; that  this  description  holds,  even  though  the  particular  frustration  or stress was  never  considered in therapy; that the more  effective meeting  of  frustration  is  not  a  surface  phenomenon  but  is  evident in autonomic  reactions which the  individual  cannot consciously  con­ trol and of which he is completely unaware.\nThis study of Thetford's is characteristic  of a  number  of the  more pioneering  and  challenging  of  those  which  have  been  carried  on. It went  beyond  clicnt-ccntercd  theory  as  it  had  been  formulated,  and made  a  prediction  consistent  with  the  theory,  and  perhaps  implicit in  it,  but  well  beyond  the  limits  of  the  theory  as  it  stood. Thus  it predicted that if therapy enabled the individual better to handle stress at  the  psychological  level,  then  this  should  be  evident  also  in  his autonomic  functioning. The  actual  research  was  the  testing  of  the correctness of the  prediction.  There  is no  doubt that the  confirming effect  on  the  theory  is  somewhat  greater  when  rather  remote  pre­ dictions are tested and found to be correct.",

        "text": "A  small  study  completed  by  Bergman  (2)  in  1950  is  an  example of the  wav  in  which  recorded  interviews  lend  themselves  to  micro­ scopic  studies  of  the  therapeutic  proccss. He  wished  to  study  the question,  W hat  is  the  nature  of  the  relationship  between  the  coun­ selor's method or technique and the client's response?\nHe  chose  to  study  all  the  instances  in  ten recorded  cases (the\nsame  cases  studied  by  Raskin  and  others)  in  which  the  client  re­ quested  an  evaluation  from  the  counselor. There  were  246  such instances  in  the  ten  cases,  in  which  the  client  requested  some  solu­ tion  for  his problems, or an evaluation of his  adjustment or progress, or  a  confirmation  of  his  own  view,  or  a  suggestion  as  to  how  he should  proceed. Each  of  these  instances  was  included  in  the  study as  a  response  unit. The  response  unit  consisted  of  the  total  client statement  which  included  the  request,  the  immediately  following response  by  the  counselor,  and  the  total  client  expression  which followed the counselor statement.\nBergman  found  that  the  counselor  responses  to these requests could be categorized in the following ways.\n1. An  evaluation-based  response. This  might  be  an  interpreta­ tion  of  the client material, agreement  or  disagreement  with the client, or the giving of suggestions or information.\n2. A  'structuring' response. The  counselor  might  explain  his own role, or the way in which therapy operates.\n3. A  request  for  clarification. The  counselor  might  indicate  that the meaning of the client's request is not clear to him.\n4. A reflection of the context of the request.  The counselor might respond  by  trying  to  understand  the  client  material  encompassing the request, but with no recognition of the request itself.\n5. A  reflection  o f  the  request. The  counselor  might  endeavor  to understand  the client's request, or the  client's  request in  a context  of other feelings.\nBergman developed  the  following categories  to  contain  the  client expression subsequent to the counselor response.\n1. Client again presents a request for evaluation, either a repetition of  the  same  request  or  some  enlargement  or  modification  of  it,  or another request.\n2. Client,  whether  accepting  or  rejecting  the  counselor  response, abandons  the  attempt to  explore  his  attitudes  and  problems  (usually going off into other less relevant material.)\n3.  Client continues to explore his attitudes and problems.\n4.  Client verbalizes an understanding  of relationships between feelings - expresses an insight.\nHaving  checked  the reliability of this categorization of both client and  counselor  material and  having  found  it satisfactory,  Berg­ man proceeded to analyze  his data. He determined which categories occurred in conjunction  w'ith other categories more frequently than  could  be  accounted  for  by  chance. Some  of  the  significant findings are these.\nThere  was  essentially  only  a chance relationship between  the categories  of  initial  client  request  and  subsequent  client  response. The  same  was  true  of  initial  client  request  and  counselor  response. Thus neither the counselor's  response  nor  the client's subsequent  ex­ pression seemed to be 'caused' by the initial request.\nOn  the  other  hand  there  was  significant  interaction  found  be­ tween  the  counselor's  response  and  the  client's  subsequent  expres­ sion.\n1. Reflection  of  feeling  by  the  counselor  is  followed,  more  often than would be  expected by chance,  by continued self-exploration or insight.  This relationship  is significant at the  1   per cent level.\n2. Counselor  responses  of  types  1   and  2 (evaluation-based  and  in­ terpretive responses  or ' structuring' responses) are\n3. and  insight. and  5 per cent level, respectively.\nfollowed, more  often  than  would  be  expected  by  chance,  by  abandonment of self-exploration. This too  is  significant  at  the  1   per  cent  level. A counselor response  requesting clarification tends to be  followed by  repetition  of  the  request,  or  by  a  decrease  in  self-exploration These  consequences  are  significant at  the  1   per  cent\nThus  Bergman  concludes  that  self-exploration  and  insight,  posi­ tive  aspects  of  the  therapeutic  process,  appear  to  be  furthered  pri­ marily by responses which are  'reflections  of feeling,'  while  evalua­ tive,  interpretive,  and  'structuring'  responses  tend  to  foster  client reactions which are negative for the process of therapy.\nThis study  is  an  illustration  of  the  wav  in  which,  in  a  number  of investigations, the verbal recording  of  therapeutic  interviews  lus been  examined  in  a  very minute and  molecular  way,  in order  to  cast light  upon  some  aspect  of  client-centered  theory. In  these  studies the  internal  events  of  therapy  have  been  examined  objectively  for the light they can throw upon the process.",

        "text": "Many investigations  have  been  made  of the  changes  in  the  client's concept  of  self,  a  construct  which  is  central  to  the  client-centered theory  of  therapy  and  personality. One,  a  study  by  Butler  and Haigh  (3), will be briefly reported  here.\nA  method which  has  frequently  been  used  for  this  purpose  is  the Q-tcchniquc  developed  by  Stephenson  (10),  and  adapted  for  the study  of  the  self. Since  an  instrument  based  on  this  technique  is used  in  the  Butler  and  Haigh  study,  it  may  be  simply  described  be­ fore giving the findings of the study itself.\nFrom a number of recorded counseling cases a  large  population of all the  self-referent  statements  was  gleaned. From  this  a  selection of  100  statements  was  made,  and  the  statements  edited  for  the  sake of clarity. The aim was to  select  the  widest  possible  range  of  ways in which  the  individual  could  perceive  himself. The  list  included such  items as:  ' I  often  feel  resentful' ;  ' I  am  sexually  attractive' ;  ' I really am disturbed' ;  ' I  feel  uncomfortable  while talking with some­ one' ; ' I  feel relaxed and nothing really bothers me.'\nIn  the  Butler  and  Haigh  study  each  person  was  asked  to  sort the cards  containing  the 100  items. First  he  was  to ' Sort  these  cards to  describe  yourself  as  you  sec  yourself  today.' He  was  asked  to sort  the  cards  into  nine  piles,  from  those  most  unlike  him,  to  those most like  him. He was asked  to place  a  ccrtain  number  in  cach  pile. (The  numbers  in  each  pile  were  1,  4, 11,  21, 26,  21, 11,  4, 1, thus giving  a forced  and  approximately  normal, distribution.) When he had  completed  this  sort  he  was  asked  to  sort  the  cards  once more  ' to  describe  the  person  you  would  most  like  within  yourself to  be.' This  meant  that  for  each  item  one  would  obtain  the  in­ dividual's  self-perception, and  also the value he attached to this characteristic.\nIt  will  be  evident  that  the  various  sortings  can  be  correlated.  One can  correlate  the  self  pre-therapy  with the  self post-therapy, or the  self  with  the  ideal  self,  or  the  ideal  self  of  one  client  with  the ideal  of  another. High  correlations  indicate  little discrepancy  or change,  low  correlations  the  reverse. Study  of  the  specific  items which  have  been  changed  in  their  placement  over  therapy,  for  ex­ ample,  gives  a  qualitative  picture  of  the  nature  of  the  change. Be­",

By and large this pro­ cedure  has  enabled  investigators  to  turn  subtle  phenomenological perceptions into objective and manipulable data.\nLet  us  turn  to  the  use  made  of  the  Q-sort  of  self  items  in  the Butler  and  Haigh  study. The  hypotheses  were: (1) that clientcentered therapy results in  a  decrease in the  discrepancy between  the pcrceivcd  self  and  the  valued  self;  and  (2)  that  this  decrease  in  dis­ crepancy will  be  more  marked  in  clients  who  have  been  judged,  on the  basis  of  independent  criteria,  as  having  exhibited  more  move­ ment in therapy.\nAs part of a  much  more  comprehensive  total  program  of  research (8)  the  Q-sort  for  self  and  for  ideal  self  was  given  to  25  clients  be­ fore therapy  started, after the conclusion of therapy, and at a follow-up point six to twelve months after the conclusion of therapy. The  same  program  of  testing  was  followed  in  a nonthcrapv  control  group  matched  for  age,  sex  and  socio-economic status.\nThe  findings  are  of  interest. The  self-ideal  correlations  in  the client  group  before  therapy  ranged  from  -.47,  a  very  marked  dis­ crepancy  between  self  and  ideal,  to  .59,  indicating  that  the  self  is quite  highly  valued  as  it  is. The  mean  correlation  at  prc-thernpy was  -.01. At  the  conclusion  of  therapy  the  mean  was  .34,  and  at the  follow-up  point  it  was  .31. This  represents  a  highly  significant changc,  supporting  the  hypothesis. It  is  of  spccial  interest  that  the correlation decreases only very slightly during the follow-up period. When attention  is  directed  to  the  17  cases  who  on  the  basis of counselor ratings and changc  on  the Thematic  Apperception I cst had  shown the  most  definite  improvement  in  therapy,  the  changc  is even  sharper. Here  the  mean  at  pre-therapy  was  .02,  at  follow-up time, .44.\nFifteen members of the group constituted an 'own-control' group. They  had  been  tested  when  they  first  requested  help,  then  asked  to wait  for  60  days  before  beginning  therapy. They  were  re-tcstcd at  the  end  of  the  60-day  period,  as  well  as  at  the  post-therapy  and follow-up  times. In  this  group  of  fifteen  the  self-ideal  correlation  at the  first  test  wr as  -.01 and  at  the  end  of  the  60-day  period  it  was identical,  -.0 1 . Thus  the  change  which  occurred  during  therapy\nis  clearly  associated  'with  therapy,  and  does  not  result  simply  from the passage of time, or from a determination to obtain help.\nThe  control  group  showed  a  very  different  picture  from  the therapy  clients. The  initial  correlation  of  self  and  ideal  was  .58, and  this  did  not  change,  being  .59 at the follow-up  point. Ob­ viously  this  group  did  not  feel  the  tension  felt  by  the  client  group, tended  to  value  themselves,  and  did  not  change  appreciably  in  this respect.\nIt is reasonable  to conclude  from  this  study  that  one of  the changes  associated with client-centered therapy is that self-perception  is  altered  in  a  direction  which  makes  the  self  more  highly valued.  This change  is not a transient one, but persists after therapy. This  decrease  in  internal tension is a highly  significant  one,  but even  at  the  end  of  therapy  the  self  is  somewhat  less  valued  than  is found  to  be  the  case  in  a  non-therapy  control  group. (Therapy, in  other  words,  has  not  brought  about  'perfect  adjustment,'  or  a complete absence of tension.) It is  also  clear  that  the  changes  under discussion  have  not  occurred  simply  as  a  result  of  the  passage  of time,  nor as the  result  of a decision  to  seek  help. They are  definitely associated with the therapy.\nThis  study  is  an  example  of  many  which  have  thrown  light  on the  relationship  of  therapy  to  self-perception. From  other  studies (reported  in  Rogers and Dymond  (8 ))  we  know that it is primarily the  self-concept  which  changes  in  therapy,  not  the  ideal  self. The latter tends  to  change  but slightly,  and  its  change  is  in  the  direction of  becoming  a  less  demanding,  or  more  achievable  self. We  know that  the  self-picture emerging  at  the  end  of  therapy  is  rated  by clinicians  (in  a  manner  which  excludes  possible  bias)  as  being  bet­ ter adjusted. We know  that this  emerging self  has  a  greater  degree of  inner  comfort,  of self-understanding  and  self-acceptance,  of self­ responsibility. We  know  that  this  post-therapy  self  finds  greater satisfaction  and  comfort  in  relationships  with  others. Thus  bit  by bit  we  have  been  able  to  add  to  our  objective  knowledge  of  the changes wrought by therapy in the client's perceived self.\nD oes  P sych o th era py  B ring  C h ange  in E veryday  B ehavior?\nThe  studies  described  thus  far  in  this  chapter,  and  others  which might be  cited, provide  evidence  that client-centered  therapy brings\nmany changcs.  The  individual  makes  choices  and  establishes  values differently;  he  meets  frustration  with  less  prolonged  physiological tension,  he changes  in  the  way  he  perceives  himself  and  values  him­ self. But  this  still  leaves  unanswered  the  question  of  practical  con­ cern to the layman  and  to  society, ' Does  the client's everyday behavior  change  in  such  a  way  that  the  changcs  can  be  observed, and  is the  nature  of  these changcs  positive?' It was  to try to answer this  question  that  I,  with  the  help  of  colleagues,  undertook an  investigation  of  changes  in  the  maturity  of  the  client's  behavior as  related  to  therapy,  a  study  published  in 1954  (6).\nThe theory of client-centered  therapy  hypothesizes that  the  inner changcs  taking  place in therapy will causc the individual after therapy to behave in ways  which  are  less  defensive,  more  socialized, more  acceptant  of  reality  in  himself  and  in  his  social  environment, and  which  give  evidence  of  a  more  socialized  system  of  values. He will,  in  short,  behave  in  ways  which  are  regarded  as  more  mature, and  infantile  ways  of  behaving  will  tend  to  decrease. The  difficult question to which we addressed ourselves was whether an operational definition  could  be  given  to  such  a  hypothesis  in  order  to  put  it  to empirical test.\nThere  are  few  instruments  which  even  purport  to  measure  the quality  of  one's  everyday  behavior. The  best  for  our  purposes  was that  developed  by  W illoughby  a  number  of  years  ago,  and  termed the  Emotional  Maturity  Scale. He  constructed  many  items  descrip­ tive of  behavior  and had  them  rated  by 100  clinical workers psychologists  and  psychiatrists - as  to  the  degree  of  maturity  they represented. On  the  basis  of  these  judgments  he  sclccted  60  items to  compose  his  Scale. The  scores  range  from  1 (most  immature) to  9  (most  mature). Several  of  the  items,  and  their  score  values, are  listed  below  to  give  the  reader  something  of  the  flavor  of  the Scale.",

When driving  an  automobile,  S  is  unperturbed  in  ordin.iry  siiuitions but  becomes  angry with other drivers who  impede his progress  (Item  12).\n260 R e s e a r c h i n P s y c h o t h j  r a p y 5. On  unmistakable  demonstration  of  his inferiority  in some  respect, S is impressed but consoles himself  by the contemplation  of those activities in which he is superior (Item 45). 7. S  organizes  and  orders  his  efforts  in  pursuing  his  objective,  evi­ dently regarding  systematic method  as a means  of  achieving them  (Item  17). S  welcomes  legitimate  opportunities  for  sexual  expression;  is  not\n9. ashamed, fearful, or prcoccupicd  with the topic  (Item 53).\nHaving  selected  our  instrument  we  were  able  to  state  our  hy­ pothesis  in  operational  form: Following  the  completion  of  clicntccntcred  therapy,  the  behavior  of  the  client  will  be  rated,  by  him­ self  and  by  others  who  know  him  well,  as  being  more  mature,  as evidenced by a higher score on the E-M  Scale.\nThe  method  of  the  study  was  necessarily  complex,  since  accurate and reliable measurements  of  everyday  behavior  are difficult to obtain. The  study  was  made  as  a  part  of  a  larger  program  of  in­ vestigation  of  nearly  thirty  clicnts  and  an  equal  group  of  matched controls  (8).  The various steps were as follows.\n1. The  client,  prior  to  therapy,  was  asked  to  make  a  self-evalua­ tion of his behavior on the E-M  Scale.\n2.  The  client  was  asked  for  the  names  of  two  friends  who  knew him  well  and  who  would  be  willing  to  make  ratings  of  him. The contact  with  these  friends  was  by  mail,  and  their  ratings  on  the E-Al Scale were mailed dircctly to the Counseling Center.\n3. Each  friend  was  requested  to  rate,  at  the  same  time  that  he rated  the  client,  one  other  person  well  known  to  him. The  purpose of this was to determine the reliability of the friend's  ratings.\n4. That  half  of  the  therapy  group  which  had  been  designated  as the own-control  group,  filled out  the E-Al  Scale  when  first  re­ questing  help and  again,  sixty days later, before therapy began. Ratings  of  the  client  by  his  two  friends  were  also  obtained  at  each of these times.\n5.  At  the  conclusion  of  therapy  the  client  and  his  two  friends were again requested for a rating on the E-.M Scale.\n6. Six  to  twelve  months  following  the  conclusion  of  therapy  rat­\nings  of  his  behavior  were  again  obtained  from  the  client  and  his friends.\n7. The members of the matched control group rated their behavior on the E-Al Scale at each of the points from which such  ratings were obtained from the therapy group.\nThis  design  assembled  a  large  body  of  data  permitting  analysis from  various  angles. Only  the major  findings  will he reported here.\nThe  E-M  Scale  proved  to  have  satisfactory  reliability  when  used by any one rater, whether the client or an observcr-friend.  I Iowever the agreement between the different raters was not close.\nThe individuals in the matched non-thcrapy conrrol group showed  no  significant  change  in  their  behavior  ratings  during  any of the periods involved in the study.\nThe clients who were members of the own-control group  showed no significant behavioral change during the sixty-day waiting period, whether judged by their own ratings or that of their friends.\nThere  was  no  significant  change  in  the  observer's  ratings  of  the client's behavior  over the  period  of  therapy  or  the  combined  period of  therapy  and  follow-up. This  was,  of  course,  contrary  to  our hypothesis. It  seemed  desirable  to  determine  whether  this  negative finding held for all  clients regardless of the movement  they  appeared to make  in  therapy. Consequently  the  clients  were  divided into those  rated  by  counselors  as  showing  most,  moderate,  or  least  move­ ment in therapy.\nIt  was  found  that  for  those  rated  as  showing  the  most  movement in  therapy,  the  friend's  ratings  of  the  client's  maturity  of  behavior increased  significantly (5 per  cent  level). In the group  showing moderate movement  there was little change, and in the group showing least movement there was a negative change, in  the direction of less mature behavior.\nThere  was  a definite and significant correlation between the therapist's  ratings  of  movement  in  therapy,  and  the  friends'  obser­ vations  of  change  in  everyday  behavior. This  correlation  is  par­ ticularly interesting because the therapist's judgment was based solely on client reactions in the therapy hour, with  little or no knowl­\nedge  of  outside  behavior. The  friends'  ratings  were  based  solely  on outside  observation,  with  no  knowledge  of  what  was  going  on  in therapy.\nIn  general  these  findings  were  paralleled  by  the  clients'  ratings of their own behavior, with  one  interesting exception.  Those  clicnts who  were rated by  their counselors as showing  movement in therapy  rated  themselves  as  showing  an  increase in  maturity, the ratings  being  almost  identical with  those  made  by  the observers. But  those  clients  who  were  rated  by  the  counselors  as  being  least successful  in  therapy,  and  who  were  rated  by  observers  as  showing a  deterioration  in  the  maturity  of  behavior,  described  themselves  in ways that  gave  them  a  sharp  increase  in  maturity  score  both  at  the post-therapy and  follow-up  points. This  seems to  be  clear  evidence of a  defensive self-rating when therapy has not gone well.\nIn  general  then  the  conclusion  appears  justified  that  where  clientcentered  therapy  has  been  judged  to  show  progress  or  movement, there  is  a  significant  observable  change  in  the  client's  everyday  be­ havior  in  the  direction  of  greater  maturity. Where  the  therapist feels  that  there has  been  little or  no  movement  in  therapy,  then some deterioration in behavior is observed, in the direction of greater immaturity. This  last  finding  is  of  particular  interest  because  it  is the  first  evidence  that  disintegrative  consequences  may  accompany unsuccessful  efforts  to  obtain  help  in  a  relationship  with  a  clientcentered therapist.  While these  negative  consequences  are  not great, they nevertheless warrant further study.\nThis  research  illustrates  the  efforts  made  to  investigate various behavioral  results  of  psychotherapy. It also  suggests  some  of  the many  difficulties  involved in planning  a  sufficiently  rigorous de­ sign  such  that  one  can  be  sure  that  (a)  behavioral  changes  did  in fact  occur,  and (b) that  such  changes  are  a  consequence  of  the therapy and not of some other factor.\nHaving  made  this  global  study  of  everyday  behavior  changes, it seems possible  that  further  research  on  this  topic  might  better  be carried  on  in  the  laboratory,  where  changes  in  problem-solving  be­ havior. adaptive behavior,  response  to  threat  or  frustration, etc., might  be  carried  on  under  better-controlled  conditions. The  re­ ported  study  is  however  a  pioneering  one  in  indicating  both  that\nClient-Centered  Therapy  in  Contexr  of  Research 263 that\nsucccssful  therapy  produces positive behavioral  change,  and unsuccessful therapy can produce negative changes in behavior.",

        "text": "T he  final  stu d y   I wish  to report  is  one recently  com pleted  b y Barrett-L en n ard ( 1 ) . He  started  from   the  theoretical  form ulation o f   m in e r e g a r d in g   th e necessary  conditions  fo r  th erapeutic  change. He  hypothesized  that  if  five  attitu din al  con dition s  w ere  present  in the  relation sh ip ,  th e rap eu tic   c h a n g e   w o u ld o c c u r in  the  client. T o in v e stig a te this problem he developed a Relationship Inventory which  had  differen t  fo rm s  fo r  clien t  and  th erapist,  and  w hich  w as designed  to  stu d y   five  dim en sion s  o f  the  relation sh ip. T h u s   fa r he has analyzed on ly the data fro m  the  clien t p erception s o f the  relation­ ship, and it is these  fin d in gs w h ich  I  shall  re p o rt.\nIn  a  fresh  series  of  cases,  in  which  he  knew  that  he  would  have various  objective  measures  of  degree of  change,  Barrett-Lennard gave  his  Relationship  Inventory  to  each  client  after  the  fifth  in­ terview. In  order  to  give  more  of  the  flavor  of  his  study,  1 will give several of the  items regarding each variable.\nHe was interested,  for  example,  in  measuring  the  extent  to  which the client felt himself to  be  empathically understood.  So  he  included items such  as  these  regarding  the  therapist,  to  be  rated  by  the  client on a six-point scale from very true  to  very strongly not true. It  will be evident that  these  represent  different degrees of  empathic  under­ standing.\nHe appreciates what my experience feels like to me. He tries to see things thru my eyes.\nSometimes  he  thinks  that  I  feel  a  certain  way  because  he  feels that  way.\nHe  understands what  I  say  from  a  detached,  objective  point  of view.\nHe understands my words but not the way I  feel.\nA  second  element  he  wished  to  measure  was  the  level  of  regard, the  degree  of  liking  of  the  client  by  the  therapist. To  measure  this\nR e s e a r c h i n P s v c h o t h f r a p y\nthere  were  items  like the following, each  one  again rated from strongly true, to strongly not true.\nHe is curious about  ' what makes  me  tick,'  but  not  really  inter­\nI T e   cares about me. He is interested in me. ested in me as a person. He is indifferent to me. He disapproves of me.\nTo  measure  the  unconditionality  of  the regard, the extent to which  there  were  ' no  strings  attached'  to  the  counselor's  liking, items of this sort were included.\nWhether  I  am  expressing  ' good'  feelings  or  'bad'  ones  seems to make no difference to the way he feels toward me.\nSometimes  he  responds  to  me  in  a  more  positive  and  friendly way than he does at other times.\nII is  interest  in  me  depends  on  what  I  am  talking  to  him  about.\nIn order to measure the congruence or genuineness of the therapist in the  relationship, items of this sort were used.\nHe behaves just the wax- that he w, in our relationship.\nHe  pretends  that  he  likes  me  or  understands  me  more  than  he really does.\nThere  are  times  when  his  outward  response  is  quite  different from his inner reaction to me.\nHe is playing a role with me.\nBarrett-Lennard  also  wished  to  measure  another  variable  which he regarded as important- the counselor's psychological avail­ ability.  or  willingness  to  be  known. To  measure  this,  items  of  this sort were used.\nHe  will  freely  tell  me  his  own  thoughts  and  feelings,  when  I want to know them.\nHe is uncomfortable when I ask him something about himself. He is unwilling to tell me how he feels about me.\nSome of  his findings  are  of  interest. The more  experienced  of  his therapists  were  perceived  as  having  more  of  the  first  four  qualities than  the  less  experienced  therapists. In  ' willingness  to  he  known,' however, the reverse was true.\nIn the  more  disturbed  clients  in  his  sample,  the  first  four  measures all  correlated  significantly  with  the  degree  of  personality  change  as objectively measured, and  with  the  degree  of  change  as  rated  by  the therapist. Empathic  understanding was  most  significantly  associated with  change,  but  genuineness,  level  of  regard,  and  unconditionally of  regard  were  also  associated  with  successful  therapy. Willingness to be known was not significantly associated.\nThus we  can say,  with  some  assurance,  that a  relationship  charac­ terized by a  high  degree  of  congruence  or  genuineness  in  the  thera­ pist; by a sensitive and accurate empathy on the part  of the therapist; by  a  high  degree  of  regard,  respect,  liking  for  the  client  by  the therapist;  and  by  an  absence  of  conditionality  in  this  regard,  will have a high probability of being an  effective therapeutic  relationship. These  qualities  appear  to  be  primary  change-producing  influences on  personality  and  behavior. It seems  clear  from  this  and other studies  that  these  qualities  can  be measured  or  observed  in  small samples  of  the  interaction,  relatively  early  in  the  relationship,  and yet can predict the outcome of that relationship.\nThis study  is  an  example  of  recent  work  which  puts  to  test  c\\cr more  subtle  aspects  of  the  theory  of  clicnt-ccntered  therapy. It is to  be  noted  that  this  study  docs  not  deal  with  matters  of  technique or  conceptualizations. It  cuts  through  to  intangible  attitudin.il  and experiential  qualities. Research  in  psychotherapy  has,  in  my  judg­ ment,  come  a  long  way  to  be  able  to  investigate  such  intangibles. The positive  evidence  in  regard  to  four  ot  the variables,  and  the  Lick of  positive  evidence  in  regard  to  the  fifth  variable,  is  to  me  an  in­ dication  that  helpful and  discriminative  findings  may  conic from studies carried on at this level.\nIt  is  of  more  than  passing  interest  that  the  relationship  qualities associated  with progress in therapy  are all  attitudinal  qualities.  W   hile it  mav  be  that  degree  of  professional  knowledge,  or  skills  and  tech­ niques  will  also  be  found  to  be  associated  with  change,  this  study raises  the  challenging  possibility  that  certain  attitudinal  and  ex peri-\nntial  qualities  by  themselves,  regardless  of  intellectual  knowledge or  medical  or  psychological  training,  may  be  sufficient  to  stimulate a positive therapeutic process.\nThis  investigation  is  a  pioneering  one  in  still  another  respect. It is one of the first explicitly designed to study the  causative or changeproducing  elements  of  psychotherapy. In  this respect  theory  has advanced sufficiently,  and  methodological  sophistication  as well,  that we may look forward to an increasing number of  investigations into the  dynamics of personality  changc.  W e  may  in  time  be  able  to  dis­ tinguish  and  measure  the  conditions  which  cause  and  produce  con­ structive change in personality and behavior.",

        "text": "Investigations  relating  to psychotherapy  arc  burgeoning  in  the United  States. Even  the  psychoanalytic group  is embarking  on several objective studies of the process of analytic therapy. It would  be  quite  impossible  to  review  what  is  going  on  today,  since the picture  is  so  complex,  and  so  rapidly  changing.  I  shall  limit my­ self  to  very  brief  sketches  of  several  research  projects and  programs related  to  client-centered  therapy  of  which  I  have  personal  knowl­ edge.\nA study is going on at the  University  of Chicago  under the  direc­ tion  of  Dr.  John  Shlicn  to  investigate  the  changes  which  occur  in brief time-limited  therapy,  and  to  compare  these  changes  with  those which  occur  in  the  usual  unlimited  therapy. Clients  are  offered  a definite  number  of  interviews  (twenty  in  most  instances,  forty  in some)  and  therapy  is  concluded  at  the  end  of  this  time. Both  the way in  which  individuals  are  able  to  use  time,  and  the  possibility  of shortening  the  therapy  period,  arc  of  interest  to  the  investigators. This program should  be  completed  in  the  not-too-distant  future.\nA  study  which  is  closely  related  is  an  investigation  of  short-term Adlerian  therapy. With  the  active cooperation  of  Dr. Rudolph Dreikurs  and  his  colleagues,  Dr.  Shlicn  is  carrying  on  a  study  of Adlerian therapy exactly parallel  to  the  above. If  all  goes  well  with the  program  it  will  mean  that  a  direct  comparison  can  be  made  of\ntwo  sharply  divergent  therapies - Adlerian  and  client-centered in  which  the  same  pre-tests  and  post-tests  will  have  been  adminis­ tered,  the therapy  will  be identical in length, and  all interviews will  have  been  recorded.  This will  indeed be a milestone, and  should greatly  expand  our  knowledge  of  the  common  and  divergent  ele­ ments in different forms of therapy.\nAnother study at the University of Chicago is being carried  on  by Dr. Desmond Cartwright, Donald Fiske, William Kirtncr, and others. It  is  attempting  to  investigate,  on  a  very  broad  basis  indeed,  a  great many  of  the  factors  which may  be  associated  with therapeutic change. It  is  casting  a  broad  net  to  investigate  many  elements  not previously  considered  which  may  be  related  to  progress  or  lack  of progress in therapy.\nAt the University of Wisconsin,  Dr.  Robert Rocssler, Dr. Norman Greenfield, Dr.  Jerome  Berlin and  I  have  embarked  upon a  ramified group  of studies  which  it  is  hoped  will,  among  other  things,  throw light on the autonomic and physiological correlates of clientcentered  therapy. In  one  portion  of  the  investigation  continuous recordings of GSR,  skin  temperature,  and  heart  rate  are  being  made on  clients  during  the  therapy  hour. The  comparison  of  these  with the  recorded  interviews  will  perhaps  give  more  information  as  to the  fundamental  physiological-psychological  nature  of  the  process of personality change.\nA smaller project in  which several  individuals are at work  involves the  objective  study  of  the  process  of  psychotherapy. In  a recent paper  (7 )1   formulated a theoretical picture,  based upon  observation, of  the  irregularly  sequential  stages  in  the  process  of  psychotherapy. We  are  currently  at  work  translating  this  theoretical  description into  an  operational scale which  may  be  used  to  study  recorded therapeutic  interviews. Currently  studies  having  to  do  with  the  re­ liability  and  validity  of  this  scale  arc  being  carried  on.\nStill  another program at the  University of Wisconsin  in which  Dr. Eugene  Gendlin  and  I  are  the  principal  investigators,  concerns  it­ self  with  a  comparison  of  the  process  of  psychotherapy  in  schizo­ phrenic  patients  (both  chronic  and  acute)  with  that  in  normal  in­ dividuals. Each  therapist  in  the  study  will  take  on  three  clients  at a time,  matched  for  age,  sex,  socio-educational  status - one  chronic\nschizophrenic,  one  acute  schizophrenic,  and  one  person  of ' normal' adjustment  from  the  community. With  a  variety  of  pre-tests  and post-tests, and a recording of all interview s, it is hoped that this study will  have  many  findings  of  interest. It  pushes  the  testing  of  clientcentered  hypotheses  into  a  new  field,  that  of  the  hospitalized  psy­ chotic  person. Part  of  the  fundamental  In pothesis  of  the  study  is that  given  the  necessary  conditions  of  therapy (somewhat  as  de­ fined  in  the  Barrett-Lennard  study)  the  process  of  change  will  be found  to  be  the  same  in  the  schizophrenic  person  as  in  the  normal.\nPerhaps  these  brief  descriptions  are  sufficient  to  indicate  that  the body  of objective investigation stimulated by the practice and theory of client-centered  therapy  is  continuing to  grow and  ramify.",

T o  what end is all this research?'\nIts  major  significance,  it  seems  to  me,  is  that  a  growing  body  of objectively  verified  knowledge  of  psychotherapy  will  bring  about the  gradual  demise  of  'schools' of  psychotherapy,  including  this one. As solid  knowledge  increases  as  to  the  conditions  which  facili­ tate  therapeutic  change,  the  nature  of  the  therapeutic  process,  the conditions  which  block  or  inhibit  therapy,  the  characteristic  out­ comes of therapy  in  terms of personality  or behavioral  change,  then there  will be  less  and  less  emphasis  upon  dogmatic  and  purely  theo­ retical  formulations. Differences  of  opinion,  different  procedures  in therapy,  different  judgments  as  to outcome,  will  be  put  to  empirical test rather than being simply a matter of debate or argument.\nIn  mcdicine  today  we  do  not  find  a  ' penicillin  school  of  treat­ ment'  versus some other  school  of treatment. There  are  differences of  judgment  and  opinion,  to  be  sure,  but  there  is  confidence  that these will be  resolved  in the  foreseeable  future  by carefully  designed research. Just  so  I  believe  will  psychotherapy  turn  increasingly  to the facts rather than to dogma as an arbiter of differences.\nOut of this should  grow  an  increasingly  effective,  and  continually changing  psychotherapy  which  will  neither have nor need any",

It will  have  incorporated  whatever is  factually verified from any and every therapeutic orientation.\nPerhaps  I  should  close  here,  but  I  would  like  to  say  one  further word  to  those who  may abhor  research  in such  a  delicately  personal and  intangible  field  as psychotherapy.  They  may  feel  that  to  subject such  an intimate  relationship  to objective scrutiny  is somehow  to  de­ personalize  it,  to  rob  it  of  its  most  essential  qualities,  to  reduce  it  to a  cold system  of facts. 1 would  simply  like  to  point  out  that  to  date this  has  not been  its  effect. Rather the  contrary  has  been  true. The more  extensive  the  research  the  more  it has  become  evident  that  the significant  changes  in  the  client  have  to  do  with  very  subtle  and subjective  experiences - inner  choices,  greater  oneness  within  the whole person,  a  different  feeling  about  one's  self. And  in  the  thera­ pist  some  of  the  recent  studies  suggest  that  a  warmly  human  and genuine  therapist,  interested  only  in  understanding the  momcnt-bymoment  feelings  of  this  person  who  is  coming  into  being  in  the  re­ lationship  with  him,  is  the  most  effective  therapist. Certainly  there is nothing to indicate that the  coldly  intellectual  analytical  factuallyminded  therapist  is  effective. It  seems  to  be  one  of  the  paradoxes  of psychotherapy  that  to  advance  in  our  understanding  of  the  field the  individual  must  be  willing  to  put  his  most  passionate  beliefs  and firm  convictions  to  the  impersonal  test  of  empirical  research;  but  to be effective as a therapist,  he must use this  knowledge  only to  enrich and enlarge his subjective self, and  must be that self,  freely  and  with­ out fear, in his relationship to  his client.",

        "text": "/ have  found  the  experience  of  therapy to have  meaningful  and  sometimes  profound  implications for  education,  for  interpersonal  communication, for  family living,  fo r the  creative  process.\n13\nPersonal  Thoughts  on Teaching  and  Learning\nT his is  the shortest chapter in the  hook hut  if my  experience with it  is any  criterion, it  is  also  the  most  explosive. It  has  a  (to  me) mimsing history.\n/ had  agreed,  months  in  advance, to meet  'with  a conference orga?iized  by Harvard  University on  ' Classroom  Approaches  to Influencing  Human  B e h a v io r I   was  requested  to  put  on a  demon­ stration of ' student-centered teaching' - teaching based upon therapeutic  principles  as  1   had  been  endeavoring  to  apply  them  in education. I  felt  that  to  use  two  hours  with  a  sophisticated  group to  try  help  to  them  formulate  their  own  purposes,  and  to  respond to  their  feelings  as  they  did  so,  would  be  highly  artificial  and  un­ satisfactory. I did  not  know  what  I  would  do  or  present.\nAt  this  juncture  I  took  off  for  Mexico on  one  of  our  winterquarter  trips,  did  some  painting,  writing,  and  photography.  and  im­ mersed inyself in  the  writings  of Sdren  Kierkegaard. I  am  sure  ihat his honest willingness to  call a spade a spade influenced me more than I realized.\nAs the  time came  near to return I  had to face up  to  my  obligation. 1  recalled that  I  had sometimes  been  able  to  initiate  very  meaningful class  discussions  by  expressing  some  highly  personal  opinion  of  my own, and then  endeavoring to understand and accept  the  often  very\n273\ndivergent reactions and feelings  of  the  students. This seemed a sen­ sible way  of handling my  Harvard assignment.\nSo  I  sat  down  to  write,  as  honestly  as  I  could,  what  my  experi­ ences had  been with  teaching,  as  this  term  is  defined  in  the  diction­ aries, and likewise my  experience with  learning.  I was far away from psychologists,  educators,  cautious  colleagues. I s'miply put  down what I felt, with assurance  that if  I  had not  got  it  correctly,  the  dis­ cussion would help to set me on the right track.\n/  may  have  been  naive,  but I  did not  consider the  material inflam­ matory.  After all the conference members were knowledgeable, selfcritical  teachers,  whose  main  common  bond  was  an  interest  in  the discussion method in the classroom.\nI  met  with  the  conference,  I  presented  my  views  as  written  out below,  taking  only  a  very  few  moments,  and  threw  the  meeting open for  discussion. I  was  hoping  for  a  response,  but  I  did  not  ex­ pect  the  tumult  which  followed. Feelings  ran  high. It seemed  I was  threatening  their  jobs,  I  was  obviously  saying  things  I  didn't mean, etc., etc.  And  occasionally  a  quiet  voice  of appreciation  arose from  a  teacher  who  had  felt  these  things  but  never  dared  to  say them.\nI daresay  that not  one  member of the group  remembered  that  this meeting was  billed  as a  demonstration  of  student-centered  teaching. But I hope that in looking back each realized that he had lived an ex­ perience  of  student-centered  teaching. I  refused  to  defend  myself by  replying  to  the  questions  and  attacks  which  came  from  every quarter. I endeavored  to  accept  and  empathize  with  the  indigna­ tion,  the  frustration,  the  criticisms  which  they  felt. I  pointed  out that I had merely  expressed some very  personal views  of my  own.  I had not asked nor expected others to agree.  After much storm, mem­ bers  of  the  group  began  expressing,  more  and  more  frankly,  their own  significant  feelings  about  teaching - often  feelings  divergent from mine,  often feelings  divergent  from  each  other. It  was  a  very thought-provoking  session. I question  whether  any  participant  in that session has ever forgotten it.\nThe most meaningful comment  came  from  one  of  the  conference members the  next morning as I  was preparing to  leave  the  city.  All he said was, ' You kept more people awake last night!*9\n1  took  no  steps  to  have  this  small  fragment  published. My  views on  psychotherapy  had  already made  me  a  'controversial  figure' among psychologists and psychiatrists.  1 had no desire  to add cditcacators to  the  list. The statement was widely  duplicated  however  by members  of  the  conference  and  several  years  later  two  journals  re­ quested permission to publish it.\nAfter  this lengthy  historical build-up,  you may  find  the  statement itself  a  let-down. Personally  1  have  never  felt  it  to  be  incendiary. It  still  expresses  some  of my  deepest  views  in  the  field  of  education.\n5\nI w is h   t o   p r e s e n t   so m e   v e r y   b r ie f   r e m a r k s,  in   th e  h o p e   th a t  if  th e y b r in g   f o r t h   a n y   r e a c t io n   f r o m   y o u ,  I  m a y   g e t   so m e   n e w   lig h t  on my ow n ideas.\nI  find  it  a  very  troubling  thing to  think,  particularly  when  I  think about my own experiences and try  to extract  from  those experiences the  meaning  that  seems  genuinely  inherent  in  them. At  first  such thinking  is  vary  satisfying,  because  it  seems  to  discover  sense  and pattern  in  a  whole  host  of  discrete  events. But  then  it  very  often becomes dismaying,  because  I  realize  how  ridiculous  these  thoughts, which have  much value to me,  would seem  to most people.  My  im­ pression  is  that  if  I  try  to  find  the  meaning of my  own  experience  it leads  me,  nearly  always,  in  directions  regarded  as  absurd.\nSo  in  the  next  three  or  four  minutes,  I  w ill  try  to  digest  some  of the  meanings w hich  have  com e  to me  from  m y  classroom  experience and the experience I  have  had in individual and group  therapy.  They arc  in  no  w ay  intended  as  conclusions  for  some  one  else,  or  a  guide to  what  others  should  do  or  be. They  are  the  very  tentative  mean­ ings,  as  o f  April 1952,  w hich  m y  experience  has  had  for  me,  and some of the bothersome questions which  their absurdity  raises. I will put  each  idea  or  meaning  in  a  separate  lettered  paragraph,  not  be­ cause they are in any particular logical order, but because each  mean­ ing is separately important to me.\na. I  m ay  as  w ell  start  w ith  this  one  in  view   o f  the  purposes  o f  this\n276\nconference. My  experience  has  been  that  I  cannot  teach  another person how to teach.  T o attempt it is for me,  in the  long  run,  futile.\nb.  It  seems  to  vie  that  anything  that  can  be  taught  to  another  is relatively  inconsequential,  and  has  little  or  no  significant  influence on  behavior. That  sounds  so  ridiculous  I  can't  help  but  question  it at the same time that I present it.\nc.  I realize increasingly that  I am  only interested  in  learnings which  signflcantly  influence  behavior. Quite  possibly  this  is  simply a personal idiosyncrasy.\nd. 1  have  come  to  feel  that  the  only  learning  which  significantly influences behavior is self-discovered, self-appropriated learning.\ne.  Such  self-discovered  learning,  truth  that  has  been  personally appropriated  and  assimilated  in  experience,  cannot  be  directly  communicated to another.  As soon as an individual  tries  to communicate such experience dircctly, often with a quite natural enthusiasm,  it be­ comes teaching, and its results are inconsequential.  It was some  relief recently to  discover that S0ren  Kierkegaard,  the  Danish  philosopher, had  found  this  too,  in  his  own  experience,  and stated  it very  clearly a century ago.  It made it seem less absurd.\nf. As  a consequence  of the  above,  / realize  that  I have  lost  interest in being a teacher.\ng.  When  I  try  to  teach,  as  I  do  sometimes,  I  ain  appalled  by  the results,  which  seem  a  little  more  than  inconsequential,  because some­ times the  teaching appears to succeed.  When this happens I  find  that the  results  are  damaging. It  seems  to  cause  the  individual  to  distrust his  own  experience,  and  to  stifle  significant  learning. Hence  I  have come to feel that the  outcomes of  teaching are  either unimportant or hurtful.\nh.  When  I  look  back  at  the  results  of  my  past  teaching,  the  real results  seem  the  same - either  damage  was  done,  or  nothing  signif­ icant occurred.  This is frankly troubling.\ni. As  a  consequence,  I  realize  that  I  a?jj  only  interested  in  being  ,i learner,  preferably  learning  things  that  matter,  that  have  some  sigviflcant influence on my own behavior.\nj. / find it very  rewarding to learn,  in  groups,  in relationships with one person as in therapy, or by myself.\nk.  I  find  that  one  of  the  best,  but  most  difficult  ways  for  me  to\n111\nlearn  is  to  drop  my  own  defensiveness,  at  least  temporarily,  and  to try  to  understand  the  way  in  which  his  experience  seems  and  feels to the other person.\n1 . /  find  that  another  way  of  learning  for  me  is  to  state  iny  oven uncertainties,  to  try  to  clarify  my  puzzlements,  and  thus  get  closer to the meaning that my experience actually seems to have.\nm.  This whole train  of experiencing,  and  the meanings that I  have thus  far  discovered  in  it,  seem  to  have  launched  me  on  a  process which  is both  fascinating and at  times a  little frightening.  It seems to mean letting my experience carry me on, in a direction ·which appears to  be  forward,  toward goals  that  I  can  but  dimly  define,  as  I  try  to understand at least the current meaning  of that experience.  The sen­ sation  is  that  of  floating  with  a  complex  stream  of  experience,  with the  fascinating  possibility  of  trying  to  comprehend  its  ever  chang­ ing complexity.\nI  am almost afraid  I  may  seem  to  have  gotten  away  from  any  dis­ cussion  of  learning,  as  well  as  teaching. Let  me  again  introduce  a practical  note  by  saying  that  by  themselves  these  interpretations  of my own  experience  may  sound  queer  and  aberrant,  but not  particu­ larly shocking.  It  is  when  I  realize  the  implications  that I  shudder  a hit  at  the  distance  I  have  come  from  the  commonscnse  world  that everyone  knows  is  right. I can  best  illustrate  that  by  saying  that  if the experiences of others  had  been the  same  as mine,  and  if they  had discovered  similar  meanings  in  it,  many  consequences  would  be  im­ plied.\na. Such  experience  would  imply  that  wc  would  do  away  with teaching. People  w ould  get  together  if  they  w  ished  to  learn.\nb. We  would  do  away  with  examinations. They  measure  only the inconsequential type of learning.\nc. The  implication w ould  be  that  wc  would  do away  w  ith  grades and credits for the same reason.\nd. We would  do  away  with  degrees  as  a  measure  of  compctcncc partly  for  the  same  reason. Another  reason  is  that  a  degree  marks an end or a conclusion  of something,  and  a  learner  is  only  interested in the continuing proccss of learning.\ne. It  wr ould  imply  doing  away  w'ith  the  exposition  of  conclusions,\nfor  we  would  realize  that  no  one  learns  significantly  from  conclu­ sions.\nI  think  I  had  better  stop  there. I  do  not  want  to  become  too  fan­ tastic. I want  to  know  primarily  whether  anything  in  my  inward thinking as I  have tried  to  describe  it,  speaks  to  anything in  your ex­ perience  of  the  classroom  as  you  have  lived  it,  and  if  so,  what  the meanings are  that exist for you  in your experience.\n14\nSignificant  Learning:\nIn  Therapy  and  in  Education\nG oddard College,  at  Plainfield,  Vermont , is  a  small  experimental college 'which in addition  to its efforts  on behalf of its students, frequently organizes conferences and workshops  for educators, ·where they  may  deal with  significant  problems. I  was asked  to  lead such a workshop in February  1958, on ' The Implications of Psycho­ therapy  for  E d u c a tio n T e a c h e r s   and  educational  administrators from  the  eastern  half  of  the  country, aiid  especially  from  the  New England area, found their way  through the thick snowdrifts to spend three concentrated days together.\nI decided to try  to reformulate my  views on  teaching and learning for  this  conference,  hopefully  in  a  way  which  would  be  less  dis­ turbing  than  the  statement  in  the  preceding  chaptcr,  yet  without dodging  the  radical  implications  of  a  therapeutic  approach. This paper  is  the  result. For  those  who  are  fajniliar  with  Part  II  of  this book the sections on uThe Conditions of Learning in Psychotherapy\"1 and  ' The  Process  of  Learning  in  Therapy'  will  be  redundant  and may be skipped, since they are merely  a restatement of the basic con­ ditions  for  therapy,  as  described  earlier.\nTo  me  this  is  the  most  satisfying  formulation  I  have  achieved  of the meaning of the hypotheses of client-centered therapy  in  the field of education.\nX\nP cations  which  psychotherapy  has  for  education. r f . s f . n t e d   h f . r e is  a   T H K sis, a  point  of  view,  regarding  the  impli­ It is a stand which I take  tentatively,  and  with  some  hesitation. I  have  many  un­ answered questions about this thesis.  But it has, I  think, some  clarity in  it,  and  hence  it may provide a starting point from which clear dif­ ferences can emerge.",

        "text": "Let  me  begin  by  saying  that  my  long  experience  as  a  therapist convinces me that significant learning is facilitated  in  psychotherapy, and  occurs in that relationship. By significant learning I  mean learn­ ing  which  is  more  than  an  accumulation  of  facts. It is learning which makes  a difference - in the individual's behavior, in the course  of  action  he  chooses  in  the  future,  in  his  attitudes  and  in  his personality.  It is a pervasive learning which is not just an accretion of knowledge,  but  which  interpenetrates  with  every  portion  of  his ex­ istence.\nNow it is  not  only my subjective  feeling  that  such  learning  takes place. This  feeling  is  substantiated  by  research. In  client-centered therapy, the orientation with which I  am most familiar,  and  in which the  most  research  has  been  done,  we  know  that  exposure  to  such therapy  produces  learnings,  or  changes,  of these  sorts:\nThe person comes see himself differently.\nHe accepts himself and his feelings more fully.\nHe becomes more self-confident and self-directing.\nHe becomes more the person he would like to be.\nHe becomes more flexible, less rigid, in his perceptions.\nHe adopts more realistic goals for himself.\nHe behaves in a more mature fashion.\nHe  changes  his  maladjustive  behaviors,  even  such  a  long-estab­ lished one as chronic alcoholism.\nHe becomes more acceptant of others.",

        "text": "I  believe  I  am  accurate  in  saying  that  educators  too  are  interested in learnings  which make a difference.  Simple knowledge  of facts has its  value. To  know  who  won  the  battle  of  Poltava,  or  when  the umpteenth opus  of Mozart was  first performed, may win $64,000 or some  other  sum  for  the  possessor  of  this  information,  but  I  believe educators  in  general  arc  a  little  embarrassed  by  the  assumption  that the  acquisition  of  such  knowledge  constitutes  education. Speaking of  this  reminds  me  of  a  forceful  statement  made  by  a  professor  of agronomy  in  my  freshman  year  in  college. Whatever  knowledge I  gained  in  his  course  has  departed  completely,  but I  remember how, with  W orld  W ar  I  as  his  background,  he  was  comparing  factual knowledge with ammunition.  He  wound up  his little  discourse  with the exhortation, ' Don't be  a damned  ammunition wagon; be a rifle!' I  believe  most  educators  would  share  this  sentiment  that  knowledge exists primarily for use.\nTo the extent then  that educators arc interested in learnings m hich are  functional,  which  make  a  difference,  which  pervade  the  person and  his  actions,  then  they  might  well  look  to  the  field  of  psycho­ therapy  for  leads  or  ideas. Some  adaptation  for  education  of  the learning  process  which  takes  place  in  psychotherapy  seems  like  a promising possibility.",

It may be that he finds himself behaving in ways in which  he  cannot control,  or he  is overwhelmed by confusions and conflicts,  or  his marriage is going on  the rocks,  or he  finds  himself  unhappy  in  his  work. He is,  in  short,  faced  with  a problem  w'ith which  he  has  tried  to  cope,  and  found  himself unsuc­ cessful.  He  is  therefore  eager to  learn,  even  though at the same  time he  is frightened  that what he discovers in  himself may be  disturbing. Thus one of the conditions nearly always present is an uncertain and ambivalent  desire  to  learn  or  to  change,  growing out of a  perceived difficulty in meeting life.\nWhat  are  the  conditions  which  this  individual  meets  when  he comes  to  a  therapist? I have  recently  formulated  a  theoretical  pic­ ture  of  the  necessary  and  sufficient  conditions  which  the  therapist provides,  if  constructive  change  or  significant  learning  is  to  occur (8). This  theory  is  currently  being  tested  in  several  of  its  aspects by  empirical  research,  but  it  must  still  be  regarded  as  theory  based upon  clinical  experience  rather  than  proven  fact. Let  me  describe briefly the  conditions  which  it  seems  essential that  the therapist should provide.",

        "text": "If  therapy  is  to  occur,  it  seems  necessary  that  the  therapist  be,  in the  relationship, a  unified,  or integrated, or  congruent person.  W hat I  mean  is  that within  the  relationship  he  is  exactly  what  he  is -  not a fagade, or a role, or a pretense.  I  have used  the term ' congruence' to  refer  to  this  accurate  matching  of  experience  with  awareness. It is  when  the  therapist  is  fully  and  accurately  aware  of  what he  is ex­ periencing  at  this  moment  in  the  relationship,  that  he  is  fully  con­ gruent. Unless this congruence  is present  to a considerable  degree it is unlikely that significant learning can occur.\nThough  this  concept  of  congruence  is  actually  a  complex  one,  I believe all  of  us  recognize  it in an  intuitive  and commonsense  way in individuals  with  whom  we  deal. With one individual  we  recognize\nthat  he  not  only  means  exactly  what  he  says,  but  that  his  deepest feelings  also match  what he is expressing.  Thus whether he  is angry or  affectionate  or  ashamed  or  enthusiastic,  we  sense  that  lie  is  the same at all levels -  in what he  is experiencing at an organismic level, in  his awareness at the  conscious level, and in  his words and commu­ nications. We  furthermore  recognize  that  he  is  acceptant  of  his immediate feelings.  W e  say  of such a person  that we know  'exactly where  he  stands.' We  tend  to  feel  comfortable  and  secure  in  such a  relationship. With  another  person  we  recognize  that  what  he  is saying  is  almost  certainly  a  front  or  a  fagade. We  wonder what he really  feels,  what  he  is  really  experiencing,  behind  this  facade. We may also  wonder  if he  knows what  he  really  feels,  recognizing  that he  may be  quite  unaware of the  feelings he is  actually experiencing. With such  a  person  we  tend  to  be  cautious  and  wary. It  is  not  the kind  of  relationship  in  which  defenses  can  be  dropped  or  in  which significant learning and change can occur.\nThus  this  second  condition  for  therapy  is  that  the  therapist  is characterized  by  a  considerable  degree  of  congruence  in  the  rela­ tionship. He is  freely,  deeply,  and  acceptantly  himself,  with  his  ac­ tual  experience  of his  feelings  and  reactions  matched  by  an  accurate awareness  of  these  feelings  and  reactions  as  they  occur  and  as  they change.",

        "text": "A third  condition  is  that  the  therapist  experiences  a  warm  caring for  the  client - a  caring which  is  not  possessive,  which  demands  no personal gratification.  It is an atmosphere which simply demonstrates ' I care' ;  not  ' I  care  for  you  if  you  behave  thus  and  so.' Standal (11)  has  termed  this  attitude  'unconditional  positive  regard,'  since it  has  no  conditions  of  worth  attached  to  it. I have  often  used  the term 'acceptance' to describe this  aspect of  the  therapeutic  climate. It  involves  as  much  feeling  of  acceptance  for  the  client's  expression of  negative,  'bad,'  painful,  fearful,  and  abnormal  feelings  as  for  his expression  of  ' good,'  positive, mature,  confident  and  social f e e l ­ ings. It  involves  an  acceptance  of  and  a  caring  for  the  clicnt  as  a separate  person,  with  permission  for  him  to  have  his  own  feelings and  experiences,  and  to  find  his  own  meanings  in  them. To  the degree  that  the  therapist  can  provide  this  safety-creating climate  of\n284 W hat  A re  t h e I m p l i c a t i o n s f o r L iv in g ? unconditional  positive  regard,  significant  learning  is  likely  to  take\nplace.",

T o  sense  the  client's private world  as if it were your  own,  but  without  ever  losing  the ' as if' quality - this  is empathy,  and  this  seems  essential  to  therapy. To  sense  the  client's anger,  fear,  or  confusion  as  if  it  were  your  own,  yet  without  your own  anger,  fear,  or  confusion  getting  bound  up  in  it,  is  the  condi­ tion we are  endeavoring to  describe.  When the client's world is this clear  to  the  therapist,  and  he  moves  about  in  it  freely,  then  he  can both  communicate  his  understanding  of  what  is  clearly  known  to the  client  and  can  also  voice  meanings  in  the  client's  experience  of which  the  client  is  scarcely  aware. That  such  penetrating  empathy is  important  for  therapy  is  indicated  by  Fiedler's  research  in  which items  such  as  the  following  placed  high  in  the  description  of  rela­ tionships  created  by  experienced  therapists:\nThe  therapist  is  well  able  to  understand  the  patient's  feelings.\nThe therapist is never in  any doubt about what  the patient means. The  therapist's  remarks  fit  in  just  right  with  the  patient's  mood and  content.\nThe  therapist's  tone  of  voice conveys  the complete  ability  to share  the  patient's  feelings.  (3)",

The rigid  ways in  which  he  has  construed  the  meaning  of  his experience are  looked  at,  and  he  finds  himself  questioning  many  of  the  ' facts' of  his  life, discovering  that  they  are  only  ' facts'  because  he  has regarded  them  so. He  discovers  feelings  of  which  he  has  hcen unaware,  and  experiences  them,  often  vividly,  in  the  therapeutic  re­ lationship.

Nor,  in  some  sense,  is  the  motivation  supplied  by  the  client,  at  least in any conscious way.  Let us say rather that the motivation for learn­ ing  and  change  springs  from  the  self-actualizing  tendency  of  life itself,  the  tendency  for  the  organism  to  flow  into  all  the  differen­ tiated  channels  of  potential  development,  insofar  as  these  arc  ex­ perienced  as  enhancing.\nI could  go  on  at  very  considerable  length  on  this,  but  it  is  not my  purpose  to  focus  on  the  process  of  therapy  and  the  learnings which  take  place,  nor  on  the  motivation  for  these learnings, but rather on  the conditions which make them possible.  So 1   will simply conclude  this  description  of  therapy  by  saying  that  it  is  a  type  of significant learning which takes place when  five conditions arc met:\nWhen the client perceives  himself as  faced  by a  serious and  mean­ ingful  problem;\nWhen  the  therapist  is  a  congruent  person  in  the  relationship,  able to  be  the  person  he  is;\nWhen  the  therapist  feels  an  unconditional  positive  regard  for  the client;\nWhen the  therapist  experiences  an  accurate  cmpathic  understand­ ing  of  the  client's  private  world,  and  communicates  this;\nWhen  the  client  to  some  degree  experiences  the  therapist s  con­ gruence,  acceptance,  and  empathy.",

        "text": "In  the  first  place  it  means  that  significant  learning  occurs  more readily  in  relation  to  situations  perceived  as  problems. I believe  I have observed evidence to support this.  In my own varying attempts to  conduct  courses  and  groups  in  ways  consistent  with  my  thera­ peutic  experience,  I  have  found  such  an  approach  more  effective,  I believe,  in  workshops  than  in  regular  courses,  in  extension  courses than  in  campus  courses. Individuals  who  come  to  workshops  or extension  courses are  those  who  are  in contact with  problems which they  recognize  as  problems. The  student  in  the  regular  university course,  and  particularly  in  the  required  course,  is  apt  to  view  the course  as  an  experience  in  which  he  expects  to  remain  passive  or resentful  or  both,  an  experience  which  he  certainly  does  not  often see  as  relevant  to  his  own  problems.\nYet  it  has also  been  my  experience  that when  a  regular  university class does perceive the course as an experience they can use to resolve problems  which  are  of  concern  to  them,  the  sense  of  release,  and the  thrust  of  forward  movement  is  astonishing. And  this  is  true  of courses  as  diverse  as  Mathematics  and  Personality.\nI believe  the  current  situation  in  Russian  education  also  supplies evidence  on  this  point. When  a  whole  nation  perceives  itself  as being  faced  with  the  urgent  problem  of  being  behind - in  agricul­ ture,  in  industrial  production,  in  scientific  development,  in  weapons development - then  an  astonishing  amount  of  significant  learning takes  place,  of  which  the  Sputniks  are  but  one  observable  exam­ ple.\nSo the  first implication for education might well be that we permit the student,  at any level, to be in  real contact with the relevant prob­ lems of  his existence, so  that he  perceives problems and issues which\nhe  wishes  to  resolve. I am  quite  aware  that  this  implication,  like the others I shall mention, runs sharply contrary to the current trends in  our  culture,  but  I  shall  comment  on  that  later.\nI  believe  it  would  be  quite  clear  from  my  description  of therapy that  an  overall  implication  for  education  would  be  that  the  task  of the  teacher  is  to  create a facilitating  classroom  climate  in  which significant  learning  can  take  place. This  general  implication  can  be broken  down  into  several  sub-sections.",

This involves  the  teacher's  being  the  person  that  he  is,  and being openly aware  of the attitudes  he  holds. It  means  that  he  feels acceptant  toward  his  own  real  feelings. Thus  he  becomes  a  real person  in  the  relationship  with  his  students. He  can  be  enthusiastic about subjects he likes, and  bored  by topics he docs not like. He can be  angry,  but  he  can  also  be  sensitive  or  sympathetic. Because  he accepts his feeling as his feelings,  he  has  no  need  to  impose  them  on his students, or to  insist that  they feel  the same  way. He  is a  person, not  a  faceless  embodiment  of  a  curricular  requirement,  or  a  sterile pipe  through which knowledge  is passed from one generation to  the next.\nI  can  suggest  only  one  bit  of  evidence  which  might  support  this view.  As I think back over a number of teachers who have facilitated my own  learning,  it  seems  to  me  each  one  has  this  quality  of  being a  real  person. I  wonder  if  your  memory  is the  same. If  so,  perhaps it  is  less  important  that  a  teacher  cover  the  allotted  amount  of  the curriculum,  or  use  the  most  approved  audio-visual  devices,  than  that he be congruent,  real,  in  his  relation  to  his students.",

Taking  the  third  and  fourth conditions of therapy as specified above, the teacher who can warmly accept,  who  can  provide  an  unconditional  positive  regard,  and  who can empathize with the feelings of fear, anticipation, and discourage­\nment  which  are  involved  in  meeting  new  material,  will  have  done a  great deal  toward setting  the  conditions  for learning. Clark  Aloustakas,  in  his  book,  The  Teacher  and  the  Child  (5),  has  given  many excellent  examples  of  individual  and  group  situations  from  kinder­ garten  to  high  school,  in  which  the  teacher  has  worked  toward  just this type  of goal. It will  perhaps disturb some that when the  teacher holds  such  attitudes,  when  he  is  willing  to  be  acceptant  of  feelings, it is not only attitudes toward school work itself which are expressed, but  feelings  about  parents,  feelings  of  hatred  for  brother  or  sister, feelings  of  concern  about  self -  the  whole  gamut  of  attitudes. Do such  feelings  have  a  right  to  exist  openly  in  a  school  setting? It  is my  thesis  that  they  do. They are related  to  the  person's  becoming, to  his effective  learning and effective functioning, and to deal  under­ standing^ and acceptantly with  such  feelings  has a  definite  relation­ ship  to  the  learning  of  long  division  or  the  geography  of  Pakistan.",

        "text": "This  brings  me  to  another  implication  which  therapy  holds  for education.  In therapy the  resources for  learning one's self lie within. There is very little data which the therapist can supply which will be of  help  since  the  data  to  be  dealt  with  exist  within  the  person. In education this is not  true. There  are  many  resources  of  knowledge, of  techniques,  of  theory,  which  constitute  raw  material  for  use. It seems  to  me  that what  I  have  said  about  therapy suggests  that  these materials,  these  resources,  be  made available  to  the  students, not forced upon them.  Here a wide  range of ingenuity and sensitivity is an  asset.\nI do  not  need  to  list  the usual  resources  which  come  to  mind - books, maps, workbooks, materials,  recordings,  work-space,  tools, and  the  like. Let  me  focus  for  a  moment  on  the  way  the  teacher uses  himself and  his  knowledge  and  experience  as  a  resource. If  the teacher holds the point of view I  have been expressing then he would probably  want  to  make  himself  available  to  his  class  in  at  least  the following  ways:\nHe would want to let them know of special experience and knowl­ edge  he  has  in  the  field,  and  to  let  them  know  they  could  call  on\nthis knowledge. Yet he  would  not want them  to  feci  that  they  must use  him in  this way.\nHe would want them to know that his own way of thinking about the  field,  and  of  organizing  it,  was  available  to  them,  even  in  lecture form,  if  they  wished. Yet again  he would want this to  be  perceived as  an  offer,  w'hich  could  as  readily  be  refused  as  accepted.\nHe  would  want  to  make  himself  known  as  a  resource-finder. Whatever  might  be  seriously  wanted  by  an  individual  or  by  the whole  group  to  promote  their  learning,  he  would  be  very  willing to  consider  the  possibilities  of  obtaining  such  a  resource.\nHe  would  want  the  quality  of  his  relationship  to  the  group  to  be such  that  his  feelings  could  be  freely  available  to  them,  without being imposed on them or becoming a restrictive  influence  on  them. He  thus  could  share  the  excitements  and  enthusiasms  of  his  own learnings,  without insisting that  the  students  follow  in  his  footsteps; the  feelings  of  disinterest,  satisfaction,  bafflement,  or  pleasure  which he feels toward individual or  group activities, without this becoming either a carrot or a stick  for  the  student. His  hope would  be that he could  say,  simply  for  himself,  ' I  don't  like  that,'  and  that  the  stu­ dent  with  equal  freedom  could  say,  ' But  I  do.'\nThus whatever  the resource  he  supplies - a  book,  space  to work, a  new  tool,  an  opportunity  for  observation  of  an  industrial  process, a  lecture  based  on  his  own  study,  a  picturc,  graph  or  map,  his  own emotional  reactions - he  would  feel  that  these  were,  and  would hope  they  would  be  perceived  as,  offerings  to  be  used  if  they  were useful  to  the  student. He  w'ould  not  feel  them  to  be  guides,  or  ex­ pectations,  or commands, or impositions or requirements.  He would offer  himself,  and  all  the  other  resources  he  could  discover,  for  use.",

All of  these  procedures might be  a part of the  experience  if  they  were  desired,  explicitly  or implicitly, by the students.  Yet even  here,  a  teacher whose work was following through  a  hypothesis  based  on therapy would  be  quick to sense a shift in  that desire. He might have been requested  to lecture to  the  group  (and  to  give  a  requested  lecture  is  very  different  from the  usual  classroom  experience),  but  if  he  detected  a  growing  disin­ terest  and  boredom,  he would  respond  to  that,  trying to  understand the feeling which  had arisen in  the  group,  since  his response  to  their feelings  and  attitudes  would  take  precedence  over  his  interest  in expounding  material.\nI have  not  included  any  program  of  evaluation  of  the  student's learnings  in  terms  of  external  criteria. I have  not,  in  other  words, included  examinations. I believe  that  the  testing  of  the  student's achievements  in  order  to  see  if  he  meets  some  criterion  held  by  the teacher,  is  directly  contrary  to  the  implications  of  therapy  for  sig­ nificant  learning. In  therapy,  the  examinations  are  set  by  life. The client  meets  them,  sometimes  passing,  sometimes  failing. He  finds that  he  can  use  the  resources  of  the  therapeutic  relationship  and  his experience  in  it  to  organize  himself  so  that  he  can  meet  life's  tests more satisfyingly  next time.  I  see  this as  the  paradigm  for  education also.  Let me  try  to  spell  out a  fantasy of what  it would  mean.\nIn  such  an  education,  the  requirements  for  many  life  situations would  be  a  part  of  the  resources  the  teacher  provides. The  student would have available the knowledge that he cannot enter engineering school without so much math; that he cannot get a job  in X   corpora­ tion  unless  he  has  a  college  diploma;  that  he  cannot  become  a  psy­ chologist  without  doing  an  independent  doctoral  research;  that  he cannot be a  doctor without knowledge of chemistry; that he cannot\neven drive a car without passing an examination on rules  of the  road. These  are  requirements  set,  not  by  the  teacher,  but  by  life. The teacher  is  there  to  provide  the  resources  which  the  student  can  use to  learn  so  as  to  be  able  to  meet these  tests.\nThere  would  be  other  in-school  evaluations  of  similar  sort. The student  might  well  be  faced  with  the  fact  that  he  cannot  join  the Math  Club  until  he  makes  a  certain  score  on  a  standardized  mathe­ matics  test;  that  he cannot  develop  his  camera  film  until  he  has shown  an  adequate  knowledge  of  chemistry  and  lab  techniques; that  he  cannot  join  the  special  literature  section  until  he  has  shown evidence  of  both  wide  reading  and  creative  writing. The  natural place  of evaluation in life is as  a  ticket of entrance, not as a  club over the  recalcitrant. Our  experience  in  therapy  would  suggest  that  it should  be  the  same way  in  the  school. It  would  leave  the student as a  self-respecting,  self-motivated  person,  free  to  choose  whether  he wished  to  put  forth  the  effort  to  gain  these  tickets  of  entrance. It would  thus  refrain  from  forcing  him  into  conformity,  from  sacri­ ficing  his  creativity,  and  from  causing  him  to  live  his  life  in  terms of  the  standards  of  others.\nI  am  quite  aware  that  the  two  elements  of which  I  have  just  been speaking - the  lectures  and  expositions  imposed  by  the  teacher  on the  group,  and  the  evaluation  of  the  individual  by  the  teacher,  consitute  the  two  major  ingredients  of  current  education. So  when  I say that  experience  in  psychotherapy  would  suggest  that  they  both be  omitted,  it  should  be  quite  clear  that  the  implications  of  psycho­ therapy for education are startling  indeed.",

        "text": "If  we  are  to  consider  such  drastic changes  as  I  have  outlined, what  would  be  the  results  which  would  justify  them? There  have been  some  research  investigations  of  the  outcomes  of  a studentcentered type of teaching  (1, 2, 4), though these studies are  far from adequate. For  one  thing,  the  situations  studied  vary  greatly  in  the extent  to  which  they  meet  the  conditions  I  have  described. Most of  them  have  extended  only  over  a  period  of  a  few  months,  though one  recent  study  with lower  class  children  extended  over  a  full year  (4). Some  involve  the  use  of  adequate  controls,  some  do  not.\nI think  we  may  say  that  these  studies  indicate  that  in  classroom situations  which  at  least  attempt  to  approximate  the  climate  I  have described,  the  findings  are  as  follows:  Factual  and  curricular  learn­ ing  is  roughly  equal  to  the  learning  in  conventional  classes. Some studies report slightly more, some slightly less.  The student-centered group  shows  gains  significantly  greater  than  the  conventional  class in  personal  adjustment,  in  self-initiated  extra-curricular  learning,  in creativity,  in  self-responsibility.\nI have  come  to  realize,  as  I  have  considered  these  studies,  and puzzled  over  the  design  of  better  studies  which  should  be  more  in­ formative  and conclusive,  that findings from  such  research  will never answer our questions.  For all  such  findings  must  be  evaluated in  terms  of  the  goals  we  have  for  education. If  we  value  primarily the  learning  of  knowledge,  then  we  may  discard  the  conditions  I have  described  as  useless,  since  there  is  no  evidence  that  they  lead to  a  greater  rate  or  amount  of  factual  knowledge. We  may  then favor  such  measures  as  the  one  which  I  understand  is  advocated  by a  number  of  members  of  Congress - the  setting  up  of  a  training school  for  scientists,  modeled  upon  the  military  academies. But  if we  value  creativity,  if  we  deplore  the  fact  that  all  of  our  germinal ideas  in  atomic  physics,  in  psychology,  and  in  other  sciences  have been  borrowed  from  Europe,  then  we  may  wish  to  give  a  trial  to ways  of  facilitating  learning  which  give  more  promise  of  freeing the  mind. If  we  value  independence,  if  we  are  disturbed  by  the growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our present  system  induces,  then  we  may  wish  to  set  up  conditions  of learning  which  make  for  uniqueness,  for  self-direction,  and  for self­ initiated  learning.",

        "text": "I have  tried  to  sketch  the  kind of  education  which  would  be implied  by  what  we  have  learned  in  the  field  of  psychotherapy. I have  endeavored  to  suggest  very  briefly  what  it  would  mean  if  the central  focus  of  the  teacher's  effort  were  to  develop  a  relationship,\nan  atmosphere,  which  was  conducive  to  self-motivated,  self-actualizing,  significant learning.  But this is a  direction  which  leads sharply away  from  current  educational practices  and  educational  trends. Let me mention a few  of the very diverse  issues and  questions which need  to  be  faced  if  we  are  to  think  constructively  about  such  an approach.\nIn the first place,  how do we conceive the goals of education?  The approach  I  have  outlined  has,  I  believe,  advantages  for  achieving certain  goals,  but  not  for  achieving  others. We  need  to  be  clear  as to  the  way  we  see  the  purposes  of  education.\nWhat  are  the  actual  outcomes  of  the  kind  of  education  I  have described? We  need  a  great  deal  more  of  rigorous,  hard-headed research  to  know  the  actual  results  of  this  kind  of  education  as compared  with  conventional  education. Then  we  can  choose  on the  basis  of  the  facts.\nEven  if  we  were  to  try  such  an  approach  to  the  facilitation  of learning,  there  are  many  difficult  issues. Could  we  possibly  permit students  to  come  in  contact  with  real  issues? Our  whole  culture through custom, through the law, through the efforts of labor unions and  management,  through  the  attitudes  of  parents  and  teachers is  deeply  committed  to  keeping young people  away  from any  touch with  real  problems. They  are  not  to  work,  they  should  not  carry responsibility,  they  have  no  business  in  civic  or  political  problems, they  have  no  place  in  international  concerns,  they  simply  should be  guarded  from  any  direct  contact  with  the  real  problems  of  in­ dividual  and  group  living. They  are  not  expected  to  help  about the  home,  to  earn  a  living,  to  contribute  to  science,  to  deal  with moral  issues. This  is  a  deep  seated  trend  which  has  lasted  for  more than  a  generation. Could  it  possibly  be  reversed?\nAnother  issue  is  whether  we  could  permit  knowledge  to  be  or­ ganized in and by the individual,  or whether it is to be  organized for the  individual. Here  teachers  and  educators  line  up  with  parents and national  leaders to  insist that the  pupil must be  guided. He must be  inducted  into  knowledge wre  have  organized  for him. He cannot be  trusted  to  organize  knowledge  in  functional  terms  for  himself. As  Herbert  Hoover says  of  high  school  students,  ' You  simply  can­\nnot  expect  kids  of  those  ages  to  determine  the  sort  of  education they need  unless they have some  guidance.' *  This seems so  obvious to  most  people  that  even  to  question  it  is  to  seem  somewhat  un­ balanced.  Even  a  chancellor  of a  university  questions whether free­ dom  is  really  necessary  in  education,  saying  that  perhaps  we  have overestimated its value.  He says the Russians have advanced mightily in  science  without  it,  and  implies  that  we  should  learn  from  them.\nStill  another  issue  is  whether we would  wish to  oppose  the strong current  trend  toward  education  as  drill  in  factual  knowledge. All must learn the same facts in the  same  way.  Admiral  Rickover states it  as  his  belief  that  ' in  some  fashion  we  must  devise  a way  to  intro­ duce  uniform  standards  into  American  education.  .  .  .  For  the  first time,  parents  would  have  a  real  yardstick  to  measure  their  schools. If  the  local  school  continued  to  teach  such  pleasant  subjects  as  'life adjustment'  .  .  .  instead  of  French  and  physics,  its  diploma  would be,  for  all  the  world  to  see,  inferior.' ! This  is  a  statement of a very prevalent  view. Even  such  a  friend  of  forward-looking  views  in education  as  Max  Lerner  says  at  one  point,  ' All  that  a  school  can ever hope to do is to  equip the student with tools which he can later use  to  become  an  educated  man'  (5,  p.  741). It  is  quite  clear  that he  despairs  of  significant  learning  taking  place  in  our  school  system, and  feels  that  it  must take  place  outside. All  the  school  can  do  is  to pound  in  the  tools.\nOne  of  the  most  painless  ways  of  inculcating  such  factual  tool knowledge is the 'teaching machine' being devised by B. F. Skinner and  his associates  (10).  This  group is demonstrating that the  teacher is  an  outmoded  and  ineffective  instrument  for  teaching  arithmetic, trigonometry,  French,  literary appreciation, geography, or other factual  subjects. There  is  simply  no  doubt  in  my  mind  that  these teaching  machines,  providing  immediate  rewards for  ' right' an­ swers, will  be  further developed, and  will  come  into  wide use.  Here is  a  new  contribution  from  the  field  of  the  behavioral  sciences  with which  we  must  come  to  terms. Does  it  take  the  place  of  the  ap­ proach  I  have  described,  or  is  it  supplemental  to  it? Here  is  one  of the  problems we  must  consider  as  we  face  toward  the  future.\n· December 2,  195/.\nThne, t Ibid .\nI  hope  that  by  posing  these  issues,  I  have  made  it  clear  that  the double-barreled  question  of  what  constitutes  significant  learning, and how it is to  be  achieved,  poses  deep  and serious  problems  for all of us. It  is  not  a  time  when  timid  answers  will  suffice. I  have  tried to  give  a  definition  of  significant  learning  as  it  appears  in  psycho­ therapy,  and  a  description  of  the  conditions  which  facilitate  such learning. I  have  tried  to  indicate  some  implications  of  these  condi­ tions  for  education. I  have,  in  other  words,  proposed  one  answer to these  questions. Perhaps  we  can  use  what  I  have  said,  against  the twin  backdrops  of  current  public  opinion  and  currcnt  knowledge in  the  behavioral  sciences,  as  a  start  for  discovering  some  fresh  an­ swers  of  our  own.",

        "text": "I t  will  have  been  evident  earlier  in  this  volume  that  I  cannot  be content  simply  to  give my  view  of psychotherapy: I  regard  it  as essential  to  give  the  client's  perception  of  the  experience  also,  since this  is  indeed  the  raw  material  from   which  1  have  fommlated  my own views.  In the same way  I found I  could  not  be  content  simply to  formulate  my  views  of  what  education  is  when  it  is  built  upon the learnings from psychotherapy: 1 wanted to give the student's per­ ception of such education also.\nTo  this  end I  considered the  various  reports and  ' reaction  sheets' which  I  have  assembled  from  students  in  different  courses  over  the years. Excerpts from  these would have fulfilled my  purpose. In  the endy   however,  I  chose  to  use  two  documents written  by  Dr.  Samuel Tenenbaum, the first ivimediately after his participation in a course of mine, the second a letter to vie  one year later.  I am  deeply grateful  to  him  for  his  permission  to  use  these  personal  statements. I would like to place them in context for the reader.\nIn  the  swmncr  of  1958  1 was  invited  to  teach  a  four-week  course at  Brandeis  University. My  recollection  is  that  the  title  was  ' The\nProcess of Personality  C h a n g e / had  no  great  expectations  for  the coarse. It was  to  be  one  of several  courses  which  the  students  were taking,  meeting  for  three  two-hour  sessions  per  week,  rather  than the concentrated workshop pattern which  I prefer. I  learned  in  ad­ vance that the  group was  to  be unusually  heterogeneous -  teachers, doctoral  candidates  in  psychology,  counselors,  several  priests, at least  one  from  a  foreign  country,  psychotherapists  in  private  prac­ tice,  school  psychologists. The  group  was,  on  the  average,  more mature  and  experienced  than  would  ordinarily  be  found  in  a  uni­ versity  course. I  felt  very  relaxed  about  the  whole  thing. I  would do what I could to  help make this a meaningful experience for us allt but  I  doubted  that  it  could  have  the  impact  of,  for  example,  the workshops on counseling which I had conducted.\nPerhaps it was because I had very modest expectations of the group and  of myself,  that  it  went  so  well. I  would  without  doubt  class  it as among the most satisfying  of my  attempts  to  facilitate  learning in courses  or workshops. This should  be  borne  in  mind  in reading  Dr. TenenbawrCs material.\nI  would  like  to  digress  for  a  moment  here  to  say  that  I  feel  far viore assurance  in  confronting  a  new  client  in  therapy  than  I  do  in confronting  a  new  group. I feel  1  have  a  sufficient  grasp  of  the conditions of therapy so that I have a reasonable confidence as to the process  which  will  ensue. But  with  groups  I  have  much  less  con­ fidence. Sometimes  when  I  have  had  every  reason  to  suppose  a course would  go  well,  the  vital,  self-initiated,  self-directed  learning has simply  not occurred to any  great degree.  At other  times when I have  been  dubious,  it  has  gone  extremely  well. To  me  this  means that  our formulation  of the process  of facilitating learning  in educa­ tion is not nearly as accurate or complete as our formulations regard­ ing  the  therapeutic  process.\nBut  to  return  to  the  Brandeis  summer  course. It  was  clearly  a highly  significant  experience  for  almost  all  of  the  participants,  as evident  in  their  reports  on  the  course. I  was  particularly  interested in  the  report  by  Dr.  Tenenbaum,  written as much  for  his  colleagues as for me.  Here was a mature scholar, riot  an  impressionable  young student. Here was a sophisticated  educator,  who  already  had  to  his credit a published  biography  of  William H.  Kilpatrick,  the  philoso-\nStudent-Centered  Teaching\n299\nphcr of education. Hence  his  perceptions  of  the  experience  seemed unusually valuable.\nI  would  not  want  it  to  be  understood  that  I  shared  all  of  Dr. Tenenbaum's  perceptions. Portions  of  the  experience  1  perceived quite  differently,  but  this  is  what  made  his  observations  so  helpful. I felt  particularly concerned  that  it  seemed to him so much  a 'Rogers' approach, that  it was  si?nply  my  person  and  idiosyncrasies which made the experience what it was.\nFor  this  reason  1  was  delighted  to  get  a  long  letter  from  him  a year later, reporting his own experience in teaching. This confirmed what 1 have learned from a wide variety  of individuals,  that it  is not simply the  personality of  a specific teacher  which  makes  this  a dynamic  learning experience,  but  the  operation  of  certain  principles 'which may be utilized by any  'facilitator' who holds the appropriate attitudes.\n1  believe  the  two  accounts  by  Dr.  Tenenbaum  will  make  it  clear ·why teachers  who  have  experienced  the  kind  of  group  learning which  is  described  can  never  return  to  more  stereotyped  ways  of education. In  spite  of  frustration  and  occasional  failure,  one  keeps trying to  discover,  with  each  new  group,  the  conditions  which  will unleash this vital learning experience.",

The  technique,  it  seems  to  me,  is  so radically  different  from  the  customary  and  the  accepted,  so  under­ mining of the old, that it should  be  known more widely. As  good  a description  of  the  process  as  any -  I  suppose  the  one  that  Carl  R.\n300\nRogers,  the instructor,  himself would be  inclined  to  use - would be ' non-directive' teaching.\nI  had  some  notion  what  that  term  meant,  but  frankly  I  was  not prepared  for  anything  that  proved  so  overwhelming. It  is  not  that I  am  convention-bound. My  strongest  educational  influences  stem from  William Heard  Kilpatrick  and  John  Dewey,  and  anyone  who has  even  the  slightest  acquaintance  with  their  thinking  would  know that  it  docs  not  smack  of  the  narrow  or  the  provincial. But  this method which I saw Dr. Rogers carry out in a course  which he  gave at Brandeis University was so unusual, something I  could  not believe possible,  unless  I  was  part  of  the  experience. I  hope  I  shall  manage to  describe  the  method  in  a  way  to  give  you  some  inkling  of  the feelings, the emotions,  the  warmth  and  the  enthusiasms  that  the method  engendered.\nThe  course  was  altogther  unstructured;  and  it  was  exactly  that. At no moment did  anyone  know,  not even  the  instructor,  what  the next  moment  would  bring  forth  in  the  classroom, what  subject would come up for discussion,  what questions would be  raised, what personal needs,  feelings and emotions aired.  This atmosphere of nonstructured freedom - as  free  as human  beings  could  allow  each other  to  be -  was  set  by  Dr.  Rogers  himself. In  a friendly, re­ laxed  way,  he  sat  down  with  the  students  (about  25  in  number) around  a  large  table  and  said  it would  be  nice  if  we  stated  our  pur­ pose  and  introduced  ourselves. There  ensued  a  strained  silence;  no one  spoke  up. Finally,  to  break  it,  one  student  timidly  raised  his hand  and  spoke  his  piece. Another  uncomfortable  silence,  and  then another upraised  hand.  Thereafter,  the  hands  rose  more rapidly.  At no time did the instructor urge any student to speak.",

        "text": "Afterwards,  he  informed  the  class  that  he  had  brought  with  him quantities of materials - reprints, brochures, articles, books; he handed  out  a  bibliography  of  recommended  reading. At  no  time did  he  indicate  that  he  expected  students  to  read  or  do  anything\nelse. As  I  recall,  he  made  only  one  request. Would  some  student volunteer  to  set  up  this  material  in  a  special  room  which  had  been reserved  for students  of  the  course? Two students promptly  volun­ teered. He  also  said  he  had  with  him  recorded  tapes  of  therapeutic sessions  and  also  reels  of  motion  pictures. This  created  a  flurry  of excitement, and students asked whether they could be  heard and seen and  Dr.  Rogers  answered  yes.  The  class  then  decided  how  it  could be  done  best. Students  volunteered  to  run  tape  recorders,  find  a movie projector;  for the  most part this  too  was student  initiated  and arranged.\nThereafter  followed  four  hard,  frustrating  sessions. During  this period,  the  class  didn't  seem  to  get  anywhere. Students  spoke  at random, saying whatever came into their heads. It all seemed chaotic, aimless,  a  waste  of  time. A  student  would  bring  up  some  aspect  of Rogers'  philosophy;  and  the  next  student,  completely  disregarding the  first,  would  take  the  group  away  in  another  direction;  and  a third,  completely  disregarding  the  first  two,  would  start  fresh  on something else  altogether. At times there  were  some  faint  efforts  at a  cohesive  discussion,  but  for  the  most  part  the  classroom  proceed­ ings seemed to lack continuity and direction.  The instructor received every  contribution  with  attention  and  regard. He  did  not  find  any student's contribution in order or out of order.\nThe  class  was  not  prepared  for  such  a  totally  unstructured  ap­ proach. They  did  not  know  how  to  proceed. In  their  perplexity and  frustration,  they  demanded  that  the  teacher  play  the  role  as­ signed  to  him  by  custom  and  tradition;  that  he  set  forth  for  us  in authoritative  language  what  was  right  and  wrong,  what  was  good and  bad. Had  they  not  come  from  far  distances  to  learn  from  the oracle  himself? Were  they  not  fortunate? Were  they not  about  to be initiated in the right rituals and  practices by the great man himself, the  founder  of  the  movement  that  bears  his  name? The  notebooks were  poised  for  the  climactic  moment  when  the  oracle  would  give forth, but mostly they remained untouched.\nQueerly enough, from the outset, even in their anger, the members of  the  group  felt  joined  together,  and  outside  the  classroom,  there was an excitement and  a  ferment,  for  even  in  their  frustration,  they\nhad  communicated  as  never  before  in  any  classroom,  and  probably never  before  in  quite  the  way  they  had. The  class  was  bound  to­ gether  by  a  common,  unique  experience. In  the  Rogers  class,  they had  spoken  their  minds;  the  words  did  not  come  from  a  book,  nor were they the  reflection  of the  instructor's  thinking,  nor that of  any other  authority. The ideas,  emotions  and  feelings  came  from  them­ selves; and this was the releasing and the exciting process.\nIn  this  atmosphere  of freedom,  something  for which  they  had  not bargained and for  which they were not prepared, the students spoke up  as  students  seldom  do. During  this  period,  the  instructor  took many blows; and it seemed to  me that many times he appeared to be shaken;  and  although  he  was  the  source  of  our  irritation,  we  had, strange as  it may seem, a great affection for  him,  for  it did  not  seem right to be angry with a man who was so sympathetic, so sensitive to the  feelings  and  ideas  of  others.  W e  all  felt  that  what  was  involved was some slight misunderstanding, which once understood and remedied  would  make  everything  right  again. But  our  instructor, gentle enough on the surface,  had a  'whim of steel.'  He didn't seem to  understand;  and  if  he  did,  he  was  obstinate  and  obdurate;  he  re­ fused  to  come  around. Thus  did  this  tug-of-war  continue. We  all looked  to  Rogers  and  Rogers  looked  to  us. One student,  amid  gen­ eral  approbation,  observed:  ' We  are  Rogers-centered,  not  studentcentered.  W e have come to learn from Rogers.'",

        "text": "Another  student  had  discovered  that  Rogers  had  been  influenced by  Kilpatrick  and  Dewey,  and  using  this  idea  as  a  springboard,  he said  he  thought he  perceived  what Rogers  was  trying  to  get  at. He thought Rogers  wanted  students  to  think  independently,  creatively; he  wanted  students  to  become  deeply  involved  with  their  very  per­ sons,  their  very  selves,  hoping  that  this  might  lead  to  the  ' recon­ struction'  of  the  person - in  the  Dewey  sense  of  the  term - the person's  outlook,  attitudes,  values,  behavior. This  would  be  a  true reconstruction  of  experience;  it  would  be  learning  in  a  real  sense. Certainly,  he  didn't  want the  course  to  end  in  an  examination  based\non  textbooks  and  lectures, followed  by  the  traditional  end-term grade,  which  generally  means  completion  and  forgetting.* Rogers had  expressed  the  belief  almost  from  the  outset  of  the  course  that no  one  can  teach  anyone  else  anything. But  thinking,  this  student insisted,  begins at  the  fork  in  the  road,  the  famed  dilemma  set up  by Dewey.  As we  reach  the  fork  in  the  road,  we  do  not  know  which road  to  take  if  we  are  to  reach  our  destination;  and  then  we  begin to examine the situation.  Thinking starts at that point.\nKilpatrick  also sought original  thinking  from  his students  and  also rejected  a  regurgitant  textbook  kind  of  learning,  but  he  presented crucial  problems  for  discussion,  and  these  problems  aroused  a  great deal  of  interest,  and  they  also  created  vast  changes  in  the  person. Why can't committees of students or individual students get up such problems  for  discussion? t Rogers  listened  sympathetically  and  said, ' I  see  you  feel  strongly  about  this?' That  disposed  of  that. If  I  re­ call  correctly,  the  next  student  who  spoke  completely  disregarded what  had  been  suggested  and  started  afresh  on  another  topic,  quite in conformity with the custom set by the class.\nSpasmodically,  through the  session,  students  referred  favorably  to the foregoing suggestion, and they began to demand more insistently that  Rogers  assume  the  traditional  role  of  a  teacher. At  this  point, the  blows were  coming  Rogers'  way  rather  frequently  and  strongly and I  thought I saw him bend somewhat before them. (Privately, he denied  he  was  so  affected.) During  one  session,  a  student  made  the suggestion  that  he  lecture  one  hour  and  that  we  have  a  class  discus-\n* It  should  be  noted  that  Dr.  Ropers  neither  agreed  nor  disagreed. It  was not  his  habit to  respond  to  students'  contributions  unless  a  remark  was  directed specifically  to  him;  and  even  then  he  might  choose  not  to  answer. His  main objcct,  it  seemed  to  me,  was  to  follow  students'  contributions  intelligently  and sympathetically.\n+ One  student  compiled  such  a  list,  had  it  mimeographed,  distributed  it,  and for  practical  purposes  that  was  the  end  o f  that.\nIn  this  connection,  another  illustration  may  be  in  order. At the  first  session, Rogers  brought  to  class  tape  recordings  of  therapeutic  sessions. He  explained that  he  was  not  comfortable  in  a  teacher's  role  and  he  came  'loaded,'  and  the recordings  served  as  a  sort  of  security. One  student  continually  insisted  that he  play  the  recordings,  and  after  considerable  pressure  from  the  class,  he  did so,  but  he  complied  reluctantly;  and  all  told,  despite  the  pressure,  he  did  not piay  tnem  tor  more  than  an  hour  in  all  the  sessions. Apparently,  Rogers  pre­ ferred the students  to make  real  live recordings  rather  than  listen  to  those which  could  only  interest  them  in  an  academic  way.\nsion  the  next. This  one  suggestion  seemed  to  fit  into  his  plans. He said  he  had  with  him  an  unpublished  paper. He  warned  us  that  it was  available  and  we  could  read  it  by  ourselves. But  the  student said  it would not be the same.  The  person,  the author, would  be out of it, the stress, the  inflection,  the  emotion,  those  nuances  which  give value  and  meaning to  words.  Rogers  then  asked  the  students  if that was what they  wanted. They  said  yes. He  read  for  over  an  hour. After the vivid and acrimonious exchanges to  which we  had  become accustomed,  this  was  certainly  a  letdown,  dull  and  soporific  to  the extreme.  This  experience  squelched  all  further  demands  for  lectur­ ing. In  one  of  the  moments  when  he  apologized  for  this  episode ( ' It's  better,  more  excusable,  when  students  demand  it.' ),  he  said: ' You  asked me  to  lecture. It  is  true  I  am a  resource,  but what  sense would there be in my lecturing? I  have  brought  a  great quantity of material,  reprints of any  number of  lectures,  articles,  books,  tape  re­ cordings, movies.'\nBy  the  fifth  session,  something  definite  had  happened;  there  was no  mistaking  that. Students  spoke  to  one  another;  they  by-passed Rogers. Students  asked  to  be  heard  and  wanted  to  be  heard,  and what before was a  halting, stammering,  self-conscious  group became an  interacting  group,  a  brand  new  cohesive  unit,  carrying  on  in  a unique  way;  and  from  them  came  discussion  and  thinking  such  as no  other  group  but  this  could  repeat  or  duplicate. The  instructor also  joined  in,  but  his  role,  more  important  than  any  in  the  group, somehow became merged with the group;  the  group  was  important, the center, the base of operation,  not the instructor.\nWhat caused  it? I  can  only  conjecture  as  to  the  reason. I  believe that  what  happened  was  this:  For  four  sessions  students  refused  to believe  that  the  instructor  would  refuse  to  play  the  traditional  role. They still  believed  that  he  would  set the  tasks;  that  he  would  be  the center  of  whatever  happened  and  that  he  would  manipulate  the group. It took  the  class  four  sessions to realize that  they were wrong;  that  he  came  to  them  with  nothing  outside  of  himself,  out­ side  of  his  own person;  that  if  they  really wanted something to  hap­ pen,  it  was  they  who  had  to  provide  the  content - an  uncomfort­ able,  challenging situation  indeed. It  was  they  who  had  to  speak  up, with  all  the  risks  that  that  entailed. As  part  of  the  process,  they\nshared,  they  took  exception,  they  agreed,  they  disagreed. At  any rate,  their  persons,  their  deepest selves  were  involved;  and  from  this situation, this special, unique group, this new creation was born.",

        "text": "As  you  may  know,  Rogers  believes  that  if  a  person  is  accepted, fully  accepted,  and  in  this  acceptance  there  is  no  judgment,  only compassion  and  sympathy,  the  individual  is  able  to  come  to  grips w ith himself, to  develop the  courage to give up  his  defenses nnd  face his true self.  I saw this process work.  Amid the early efforts to com­ municate,  to find a 7 nodus vivendi, there had been in the group tenta­ tive  exchanges  of  feelings,  emotions  and  ideas;  but  after  the  fourth session,  and progressively thereafter, this group,  haphazardly thrown together, became close to one  another and  their true selves  appeared. As they interacted, there were moments of insight and revelation and understanding that were  almost awesome  in nature; they were what, I believe,  Rogers  would  describe  as  'moments  of  therapy,'  those pregnant moments when you see a  human soul  revealed  before  you, in all its breathless wonder;  and then  a  silence,  almost  like  reverence, would  overtake  the  class. And  each  member  of  the  class  became enveloped with  a warmth and a  loveliness that border on the  mystic. I  for  one,  and  I  am  quite  sure  the  others  also,  never  had  an  experi­ ence  quite  like  this. It  was  learning  and  therapy;  and  by  therapy I  do  not  mean  illness,  but what might  be  characterized  by  a  healthy change  in  the  person,  an  increase  in  his  flexibility,  his  openness,  his willingness  to  listen. In  the  process,  we  all  felt  elevated,  freer,  more accepting  of  ourselves  and  others,  more  open  to  new  ideas,  trying hard to understand and accept.\nThis is  not  a  perfect  world,  and  there  was  evidence  of  hostility  as members differed.  Somehow in this setting every blow was softened, as  if  the sharp  edges  had  been  removed;  if  undeserved,  students would go off to something else; and the  blow was somehow  lost.  In my own case,  even  those  students who  originally  irritated  me,  with further acquaintance  I  began  to  accept and  respect;  and  the  thought occurred  to  me  as  I  tried  to  understand  what  was  happening:  Once\nyou  come  close  to  a  person,  perceive  his  thoughts,  his  emotions,  his feelings,  he becomes not only understandable but good and desirable. Some of the more aggressive ones spoke more than they should, more than their right share,  but the  group  itself,  by  its  own  being,  not  by setting  rules,  eventually  made  its  authority  felt;  and  unless  a  person was  very  sick  or  insensitive,  members  more  or  less,  in  this  respect, conformed to what was  expected  of them.  The  problem - the  hos­ tile, the  dominant,  the  neurotic - was  not  too  acute;  and  yet  if measured  in  a  formal  way,  with  a  stop  watch,  at  no  time  was  a  ses­ sion  free  of aimless talk and waste of time. But yet as I  watched  the process,  the  idea  persisted  that  perhaps  this  waste  of  time  may  be neccssary;  it  may  very well be  that that  is the  way  man  learns  best; for  certainly,  as  I  look  back  at  the  whole  experience,  I  am  fairly certain  that  it  would  have  been  impossible  to  learn  as  much  or  as well  or  as  thoroughly  in  the  traditional  classroom  setting. If  we accept  Dewey's  definition  of  education  as  the  reconstruction  of  ex­ perience,  what  better  way  can  a  person  learn  than  by  becoming involved  with  his  whole  self,  his  very  person,  his  root  drives,  emo­ tions, attitudes  and  values? No  series  of facts or arguments,  no matter  how  logically  or  brilliantly  arranged,  can  even  faintly  com­ pare with that sort of thing.\nIn  the  course  of  this  process,  I  saw  hard,  inflexible,  dogmatic  per­ sons,  in  the  brief  period  of  several  weeks,  change  in  front  of  my eyes  and  become  sympathetic,  understanding  and  to  a  marked  de­ gree  non-judgmental. I saw  neurotic,  compulsive  persons  ease  up and  become  more  accepting  of  themselves  and  others. In  one  in­ stance,  a  student who  particularly  impressed  me by  his  change,  told me when  I  mentioned  this:  'It  is  true. I  feel  less  rigid,  more  open to  the  world. And  I  like  myself  better  for  it. I  don't  believe  I  ever learned  so  much  anywhere.' I saw  shy  persons  become  less  shy and aggressive persons more sensitive and moderate.\nOne  might  say  that  this  appears  to  be  essentially  an  emotional process. But  that  I  believe  would  be  altogether  inaccurate  in  de­ scribing  it. There  was  a  great  deal  of  intellectual  content,  but  the intellectual  content  was  meaningful  and  crucial  to  the  person,  in  a sense  that  it  meant  a  great  deal  to  him  as  a  person. In  fact,  one student brought  up  this  very  question. ' Should  we  be  concerned,'\nhe  asked,  ' only  with  the  emotions? Has  the  intellect  no  play?' It was my turn  to  ask,  ' Is  there  any  student  who  has  read  as  much  or thought as much for any other course?'\nThe answer was obvious.  We  had  spent hours and  hours  reading; the room reserved for us had occupants until  10 o'clock at night,  and then  many  left  only  because  the  university  guards  wanted  to  close the building. Students listened to recordings; they s;nv motion pictures;  but  best  of  all,  they  talked  and  talked  and  talked. In  the traditional  course,  the  instructor  lectures  and  indicates  what  is  to be  read  and  learned;  students  dutifully  record  all  this  in  their  note­ books,  take  an  examination  and  feel  good  or  bad,  depending  on the  outcome; but in nearly all  cases it is  a  complete  experience,  with a  sense  of  finality;  the  laws  of  forgetting  begin  to  operate  rapidly and  inexorably. In  the  Rogers  course,  students  read  and  thought inside  and  outside  the  class;  it  was  they  who  chose  from  this  read­ ing  and  thinking  what  was  meaningful  to  them,  not  the  instruc­ tor.\nThis  non-directive  kind  of  teaching,  I  should  point  out,  was  not 100  per  cent  successful. There  were  three  or  four  students  who found  the  whole  idea  distasteful. Even at the end  of  the  course,  al­ though  nearly  all  became  enthusiastic,  one  student  to  my  knowl­ edge,  was  intensely  negative in his feelings; another  was  highly critical. These wanted the instructor to provide them  with a rounded-out  intellectual piece of merchandise  which  they  could commit  to  memory  and  then  give  back  on  an  examination. They would  then  have  the  assurance  that  they  had  learned  what  they should. As  one  said, ' If I had  to make  a  report  as to what  I learned  in  this  course,  what  could  I  say?' Admittedly,  it  would\nbe much more difficult than in a  traditional course,  if not  impossible. The  Rogers  method  was  free  and  flowing  and  open  and  permis­ sive. A  student  would  start  an  interesting  discussion;  it  would  be token  up  by  a  second;  but  a  third  student  might  take  us  away  in another  direction,  bringing  up  a  personal  matter  of  no  interest  to the  class;  and  we  would  all  feel  frustrated. But  this  was  like  life, flowing  on  like  a  river,  seemingly  futile,  with  never  the  same  water there,  flowing  on,  with  no  one  knowing  what  would  happen  the next  moment. But  in  this  there  was  an  expectancy,  an  alertness,  an\naliveness;  it seemed  to  me  as  near  a  smear  of  life  as  one  could  get  in a classroom. For  the  authoritarian  person,  who  puts  his  faith  in neatly  piled  up  facts,  this  method  I  believe  can  be  threatening,  for here  he  gets no  reassurance,  only  an  openness,  a  flowing,  no  closure.",

        "text": "I  believe  that  a  great  deal  of  the  stir  and  the  ferment  that  char­ acterized  the  class  was  due  to  this  lack  of  closure. In  the  lunch room,  one  could  recognize  Rogers'  students  by  their  animated  dis­ cussions,  by  their  desire  to  be  together;  and  sometimes,  since  there was no table  large  enough,  they  would  sit  two  and  three  tiers  deep; and  they  would  eat  with  plates  on  their  laps. As  Rogers  himself points  out,  there  is  no  finality in  the  process. He  himself  never summarizes (against every conventional law of teaching). The issues  are  left  unresolved;  the  problems  raised  in  class  are  always  in a  state  of  flux,  on-going. In  their  need  to  know,  to  come  to  some agreement,  students  gather  together,  wanting  understanding,  seek­ ing  closure. Even  in  the  matter  of  grades,  there  is  no  closure. A grade  means  an  end;  but  Dr.  Rogers  does  not  give  the  grade;  it  is the student  who  suggests  the  grade;  and  since  he  does  so,  even  this sign  of  completion  is  left  unresolved,  without  an end, unclosed. Also,  since  the  course  is  unstructured,  each  has  staked  his  person  in the  course;  he  has  spoken,  not  with  the  textbook  as  the  gauge,  but with  his  person,  and  thus as  a  self  he  has communicated  with  others, and  because  of  this,  in  contradistinction  to  the  impersonal  subject matter  that  comprises  the  normal  course,  there  develops  this  close­ ness and warmth.\nTo  describe  the  many  gracious  acts  that  occurred  might  convey some  idea  of  this  feeling  of  closeness. One  student  invited  the  class to  her  home  for  a  cookout. Another  student,  a  priest  from  Spain, was so taken with  the  group  that  he  talked  of  starting  a  publication to  keep  track  of  what  was  happening  to  the  group  members  after they  disbanded.  A  group  interested  in  student  counseling met  on  its own. A  member  arranged  for  the  class  to  visit  a  mental  hospital for  children  and  adults;  also  he  arranged  for  us  to  see  the  expcri-\nmental  work  being  done  with  psychotic  patients  by  Dr.  Lindsley. Class  members  brought  in  tape  recordings  and  printed  matter  to add  to  the  library  material  set  aside  for  our  use. In  every  way  the spirit  of  good-will  and  friendliness  was  manifest  to  an  extent  that happens  only  in  rare  and  isolated  instances. In the  many,  many courses  I  have  taken  I  have  not  seen  the  like. In  this  connection, it  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  members  comprised  a  group  that had  been  haphazardly  thrown  together;  they  had  come  from  many backgrounds and they included a wide age range.\nI believe  that  what  has  been  described  above  is  truly  a  creative addition  to  classroom  methodology;  it  is  radically  different  from the  old. That  it  has  the  capacity  to  move  people,  to  make  them freer,  more  open-minded,  more  flexible,  I  have  no  doubt. I myself witnessed  the  power  of  this  method. I believe  that  non-directive teaching has profound implications which even those who accept this point  of view  cannot  at  present  fully  fathom. Its  importance,  I  be­ lieve,  goes  beyond  the  classroom  and  extends  to  every  area  where human beings communicate and try to live with one another.\nMore  specifically,  as  a  classroom  methodology,  it  warrants  the widest  discussion, inquiry  and  experimentation. It has  the possi­ bility  of  opening  up  a  whole  new  dimension  of  thinking,  fresh  and original,  for in its approach,  in its practice,  in  its philosophy  it differs so  fundamentally  from  the  old. It  seems  to  me  this  approach  ought to  be  tried  out  in  every  area  of  learning - elementary,  high  school, college,  wherever  human  beings gather  to  learn  and  improve  on  the old. At this stage  we  should  not be  overly  concerned  about  its  limi­ tations  and  inadequacies,  since  the  method  has  not  been  refined  and we do not know as much about it as we  ought.  As a new technique, it  starts  off  with  a  handicap. We are  loath  to  give  up  the  old. The old  is  bolstered  by  tradition,  authority  and  respectability;  and  we ourselves  are  its  product. If  we  view  education,  however,  as  the reconstruction  of  experience, does  not  this presume  that  the in­ dividual  must  do  his  own  reconstructing? He  must  do  it  himself, through  the  reorganization  of  his  deepest  self, his values, his at­ titudes,  his  very  person. What better method is  there  to  engross the individual;  to  bring  him,  his  ideas,  his  feelings  into  communication with  others;  to  break  down  the  barriers  that  create  isolation  in  a\n310 W hat  A re  th e  Im plic a t io n s for L iving? world where for  his  own  mental safety and  health,  man  has  to  learn to be part of mankind?\n*\nA  Personal  Teaching  Experience\n(as reported to Dr. Rogers one year later)\nby\nSamuel Tenenbaum, Ph.D.\nI f e e l   i m p e l l e d   to write to you about my first experience in teach­ ing  after  being  exposed  to  your  thinking  and  influence. You may  or  may  not  know  I  had  a  phobia  about  teaching. Since  my work with you, I began to perceive more clearly where the difficulty lay. It  was  mostly  in  my  concept  of  the  role  I  had  to  play  as  a teacher - the  motivator,  director  and  the production  chief  of  a performance. I  always  feared  being  ' hung  up'  in  the  classroom I  believe  it's  your  expression  and  I  have  come  to  like  it -  the  class listless,  uninterested,  not  responding,  and  m y  yammering  and  yam­ mering,  until  I  lost  poise,  the  sentences  not  forming,  coming  out artificially,  and  the  time  moving  slowly,  slowly,  ever  more  slowly. This was  the  horror  I  imagined. I  suppose  pieces  of  this  happen  to every  teacher,  but  I  would  put  them  all  together,  and  I  would  ap­ proach  the  class  with  foreboding,  not  at  ease,  not  truly  myself.\nAnd  now  comes  my  experience. I  was  asked  to  give  two  sum­ mer courses for the  Graduate  School  of  Education  of  Yeshiva  Uni­ versity,  but  I  had  a  perfect  alibi. I was  going  to  Europe  and  I couldn't. Wouldn't I  give  an  interim  course,  a  concentrated  course of  14  sessions  during  the  month  of  June;  and  this  would  not  inter­ fere  with  the  trip? I  had  no  excuse  and  I  accepted - because  1   no longer  wanted  to  dodge  the  situation  and  more,  also,  because  I  was determined  once  and  for  all  to  face  it. If  I didn't  like  to  teach  (I haven't taught for nearly ten  years),  I  would  learn  something. And if I  did,  I  would  also  learn  something. And if I  had  to  suffer,  it  was\nbest  this  way,  since  the  course  was  concentrated  and  the  time  ele­ ment was short.\nYou  know  that  I  have  been  strongly  influenced  in  my  thinking about  education  by  Kilpatrick  and  Dewey. But  now  I  had  another powerful ingredient - you. When  I first met  my  class, I did something  I  never  did  before. I  was  frank  about  my  feelings. In­ stead  of  feeling  that a  teacher should  know  and  students  were  there to  be  taught,  I  admitted  weaknesses,  doubts,  dilemmas,  and  N O T KNOWING.  Since  I  sort  of  dethroned  my  role  as  a  teacher  to the  class  and  myself,  my  more  natural  self  came  out  more  freely and  I  found  myself  talking  easily  and  even  creatively. By  'crea­ tively'  I  mean  ideas  came  to  me  as  I  spoke,  brand  new  ideas  which I  felt were good.\nAnother important difference:  It is true that since I  was influenced by  the  Kilpatrick  methodology  I  always  welcomed  the  widest  dis­ cussion, but I  now know, I  still  wanted  and  expected  my students to know  the  text  and  the  lecture  material  set  out  for them. Even worse,  I  now  know  that  although  1   welcomed  discussion,  I  wanted, above  all  things,  that,  after  all  was  said  and done,  the  final con­ clusions of  the  class  to  come  out  according  to  m y way  of  thinking. Hence  none  of  the  discussions  were  real  discussions,  in  the  sense that it  was  open  and  free  and  inquiring;  none  of  the  questions  were real  questions,  in  the  sense  that  they  sought  to  evoke  thinking;  all of  them  were  loaded,  in  the  sense  that  I  had  pretty  definite  con­ victions  about  what  I thought  were  good  answers  and  at  times right  answers. Hence,  I  came  to  the  class  with  subject  matter  and my  students were really instruments by which  situations were manipulated  to  produce  the  inclusion  of  what  I regarded  as  de­ sirable subject matter.\nIn  this  last  course,  I  didn't  have  the  courage  to  discard  all  subject matter,  but  this  time  I  really  listened  to  my  students;  I  gave  them understanding  and  sympathy. Although  I  would  spend  hours  and hours preparing for each session,  I  found that not once did  I  refer  to a note  from  the  voluminous  material  with which  I entered the room. I allowed  students  free  rein,  not  holding  anyone  down  to any set  course,  and  I  permitted  the  widest  diversion;  and  I  followed wherever the students led.\nI  remember discussing this with a  prominent educator  and  he  said, in  w  hat  I  thought  was  a  disappointed  and  disapproving  tone:  ' You insist,  of  course,  on  good  thinking.' I quoted  William  James,  who in  effect  said  that  man  is  a  speck  of  reason  in  an  ocean  of  emotion. I  told  him  that  I  was  more  interested  in  what  I  would  call  a  ' third dimension,' the feeling part of the students.\nI cannot  say  I followed  you  all  the  May,  Dr.  Rogers,  since  I would  express  opinions  and  at  times, unfortunately,  lecture;  and that  I believe  is  bad, since students, once  authoritative opinions are  expressed,  tend  not  to  think,  but  to  try  to  guess  what  is  in  the instructor's  head  and  provide  him  with  what  he  might  like,  so  as to  find  favor  in  his  eyes. If  I  had  to  do  it  over  again,  I  would  have less  of  that. But I  did  try  and  I  believe  I  succeeded  in  large  measure to  give  to  each  student  a  sense  of  dignity,  respect  and  acceptance; farthest  from my  mind  was  to  check  on  them  or  evaluate  and  mark them.\nAnd  the result - and  this  is  why  I  am  writing  you - was  for me an  unparalleled  experience,  inexplicable  in  ordinary  terms. I  myself cannot  fully  account  for  it,  except  to  be  grateful  that  it  happened to  me. Some  of  the  very  qualities  which  I  experienced  in  your course  I  found  in  this  which  I  gave. I found  myself  liking  these particular students as I  have  never  liked  any  other  group  of  persons, and  I  found - and  they  expressed  this  in  their  final  report - that they  themselves  began  to  feel  warm  and  kindly  and  accepting  of one  another. Orally  and  in  their  papers,  they  told  of  how  moved they  were,  how  much  they  learned,  how  well  they  felt. For  me this was  a brand  new  experience, and I was  overwhelmed  and humbled  by  it. I have  had  students  who,  I  believe,  respected  and admired  me,  but  I  never  had  a  classroom  experience  from  which came  such  warmth  and  closeness. Incidentally,  following  your  ex­ ample,  I  avoided  setting  any  fixed  requirements  in  terms  of  reading or classroom preparation.\nThat  the  foregoing  was  not  'biased  perception'  was  evidenced from  reports  I  got  outside  the  classroom. The  students  had  said such  nice  things about  me  that  faculty members wanted  to  sit  in  the class. Best  of  all,  the  students  at  the  end  of  the  course  wrote  Dean\nBenjamin Fine a letter in which  they  said  the  nicest things  about  me. And the Dean in turn wrote me to the same effect.\nTo  say  that  I  am  overwhelmed  by  what  happened  only  faintly reflects  my  feelings. I have  taught  for  many  years  but  I  have  never experienced anything remotely  resembling what occurred.  I,  for my part,  never  have  found  in  the  classroom  so  much  of  the  whole  per­ son  coming  forth,  so  deeply  involved,  so  deeply  stirred. Further,  I question  if  in  the  traditional  set-up,  with  its  emphasis  on  subject matter,  examinations,  grades,  there  is,  or there  can  be  a  place  for the ' becoming' person, with his deep and manifold needs, as he struggles to  fulfill  himself. But  this  is  going  far  afield. I  can  only  report  to you  what  happened  and  to  say  that  I  am  grateful  and  that  I  am  also humbled  by  the  experience. I would  like  you  to  know  this, for again you have added to and enriched my life and being.*\n· That  this  was  not  an  isolated  experience  for  Dr.  Tenenhaum  is  indicared by  a  quotation  from  still  another  personal  communication,  many  months  larcr. He  says: ' With  another  group  I  taught,  following  the  first  one,  similar at­ titudes developed,  only  they were more  accentuated,  because, I belic\\c, I was  more  comfortable  with  the  technique  and,  I  hope,  more  expert. In this second  group  there  was  the  same  release  of  the  person,  the  same  exhilaration and  excitement,  the  same  warmth,  the  same  mystery  that  attaches  to  a  person as he  succeeds in  shedding  portions  of  his skin. Students  from  my group told  me  that  while  attending  other  classes,  their  eyes  would  meet,  drawn  to one  another,  as  if  they  were  unique  and  apart,  as  if  they  were  bound  together by  a  special  experience. In  this  second  group,  also,  I  found  that  the  students had  developed  a  personal  closencss,  so  that  at  the  end  of  the  semester  they talked of having  annual reunions. They  said that somehow  or  other  they wanted  to  keep  this  experience alive and not  lose one  another.  They j Iso spoke  of  radical and fundamental  changes  in  their  person -  in oudook,  in values,  in  feelings,  in  attitudes  both  toward  themselves  and toward  others.''\nThe  Implications  of Client-Centered  Therapy for  Family  Life\nW hen 1 was asked several years ago , , to speak to a local group on any  topic  I  wished , 1 decided  to  take  a  specific  look  at  the changes in behavior exhibited by  our clients in their family  relation­ ships.  This paper was the result.\n£\na s an  increasing  n u m b e r   of  our  therapists  and  counselors  have j C \\ dealt with troubled individuals and groups, there has been agree­ ment  that  our  experience  is  relevant  to,  and  has  implications  for, every area of interpersonal relationships.  An  attempt  has  been  made to  spell  out  some  of  the  implications  in  certain  areas - in  the  field of  education,  for  example,  in  the  area  of  group  leadership,  in  the area  of  inter-group  relationships - but we  have  never  tried  to  make explicit  what  it  means  in  family  life. This  is  the  realm  with  which I  should  like  to  deal  now,  trying  to  give  as  clear  a  picture  as  1   can\n314\nof what meanings a client-centered  point  of view  seems to  have  for that closest of all interpersonal circles - the family group.\nI do  not  wish  to  approach  this  from  an  abstract  or  theoretical level. What I wish to  do  is to  present something of the  changes  our clients  have  experienced  in  their  family  relationships  as  they  en­ deavor to work toward a more satisfactory life in their contacts with a  therapist. I  shall  draw  heavily  on  the  verbatim statements  of  these people  in  order  that  you  may  get  the  flavor  of  their  actual  experi­ ence, and draw your own conclusions for yourself.\nAlthough  some  of  the  experience  of  our  clients  seems  to run counter  to  current  concepts  of  what  is  involved in constructive family  living,  I  am  not  particularly  interested  in  arguing  these  dif­ ferences. Also  I  am  not  particularly  interested  in  setting  up  some model  for  family  life  in  general,  or  in  proposing  the manner  in which  you  should  live  in  your  family  situation. I simply  wish  to present the  gist  of  the  experience  of some  very  real  people  in  some very  real  and  often  difficult  family  situations. Perhaps  their  strug­ gles to live in a satisfying  fashion  will have some  meaning for  you.\nWhat then, are some of the ways  in  wliich  clients  change  in  their family living, as a consequence of client-centered therapy?",

        "text": "In  the  first  place  it  is  our  experience  that  our  clients  gradually come to  express  more  fully,  to  members  of  their  families  as  well  as to  others,  their  true  feelings. This  applies  to  feelings  that  might  be thought  of  as  negative - resentment,  anger,  shame,  jealousy,  dis­ like,  annoyance - as well  as  feelings  which  might  be  thought  of  as positive -  tenderness,  admiration,  liking,  love. It  is  as  though  the client discovers  in  therapy that  it  is  possible  to  drop  the  mask  he  has been wearing, and become more genuinely himself.  A  husband  finds himself becoming furiously  angry  with  his  wife,  and  expressing  this anger,  where  before  he  had  maintained - or  thought  he  had  main­ tained - a  calm  and  objective  attitude  toward  her  behavior. It  is as though the map of expression of  feelings  has come  to  match  more closely  the  territory  of  the  actual emotional  experience. Parents and  children,  husbands  and  wives,  come  closer  to  expressing  the feelings  which  really  exist  in  them, rather  than  hiding  their  true\nfeelings  from  the  other  person,  or  from  the  other  person  and  them­ selves.\nPerhaps an  illustration  or  two  would  make  this  point  more  dear. A young wife, Mrs. Al., comes for counseling.  Her complaint is that her  husband,  Bill,  is  very  formal and  reserved  with  her, that  he doesn't  talk  to  her  or  share  his  thinking  with  her,  is  inconsiderate, that  they  are  sexually  incompatible  and  rapidly  growing  apart. As she talks out her attitudes the picture  changes  rather drastically. She expresses  the  deep  guilt  feeling which  she  has  regarding  her  life  be­ fore  her  marriage,  when  she  had  affairs  with  a  number  of  men, mostly  married  men. She  realizes that  though  with  most  people she  is  a  gay  and  spontaneous  person,  with  her  husband  she  is  stiff, controlled, lacking in spontaneity.  She also  sees herself as demanding that  he  be  exactly  what  she  wishes  him  to  be. At  this  point  coun­ seling  is  interrupted  by  the  counselor's  absence  from  the  city. She continues  to  write  to  the  counselor expressing  her  feelings, and adding,  'If  I  could  only  say  these  things  to  him (her  husband) I could  be  myself  at  home. But  what  would  that  do  to  his  trust  in people? Would you find me repulsive  if  you  were  my  husband  and learned  the  truth? I  wish  I  were  a  'nice  gal'  instead  of a  'Babe.* I've made such a mess of tilings.'\nThis is  followed by a  letter from  which a  lengthy quotation seems justified. She  tells  how  irritable  she has  been - how  disagreeable she  was  when  company  dropped  in  one  evening. After  they  left ' I felt  like  a  louse  for  behaving  so  badly.  . . .   I  was  still  feeling sullen,  guilty,  angry  at  myself  and  Bill - and  just  about  as  blue  as they come.\n' So,  I decided  to  do  what  I've  been  really  wanting  to  do  and putting off  because  I  felt  it  was  more  than  I  could  expect  from  any man - to  tell  Bill  just  what  was  making  me  act  that  terrible  way. It  was  even  harder  than  telling  you - and  that  was  hard  enough. I couldn't  tell  it  in  such  minute  detail  but  I  did  manage  to  get  out some of those sordid  feelings  about  my  parents and  then  even  more about  those  'damn'  men. The  nicest  thing  I've  ever  heard  him  say was  'Well,  maybe  I  can  help  you  there' - when  speaking  of  my parents. And  he  was  very  accepting  of  the  things  I  had  done. I told  him  how  I  felt  so  inadequate  in  so  many  situations -  because\nI have  never  been  allowed  to  do  so  many  things - even  to  know how  to  play  cards. We  talked,  discussed, and really got down deep  into  so  many  of  both  our  feelings. I didn't  tell  him  as  com­ pletely  about  the  men - their  names,  but  I  did  give  him  an  idea  of about  how  many. Well,  he  was  so  understanding  and  things  have cleared  up  so much  that I  T R U S T   HIM. I'm  not  afraid  now  to  tell him  those  silly little illogical feelings  that  keep  popping  into  my head. And  if I'm  not  afraid  then  maybe  soon  those  silly  things  will stop  popping.  The  other evening  when I  wrote  to  you  I  was almost ready to pull out- I  even  thought  of  just  leaving  town. (Escaping the  whole  affair.) But  I  realized  that  I'd  just  keep  running  from  it and  not  be  happy  until  it  was  faced. We  talked  over  children  and though we've  decided  to  wait  until  Bill  is  closer  to  finishing  school, I'm  happy with  this  arrangement. Bill  feels  as  I  do  about  the  things we want to do for our children - and most important the  things we don't  want  to  do  to  them. So  if  you  don't  get  any  more  desperate sounding  letters,  you  know  things  are  going  along  as  okay  as  can be expected.\n' Now,  I'm  wondering - have  you  known  all  along  that that  was the  only  thing  I  could  do  to  bring  Bill  and  me  closer? That  was the  one  thing I kept  telling  myself wouldn't  be fair to Bill. I thought  it  would  ruin  his  faith  in  me  and  in  everyone. I had  a barrier so big between Bill and me that I felt he was almost a stranger. The only way I pushed  myself to  do  it was to  realize  that  if  I  didn't at  least  try  his  response  to  the  things  that  were bothering  me,  it wouldn't be fair to him - to  leave  him  without  giving  him  a  chance to prove that he could be trusted.  He proved even  more than that to me - that  he's  been  down  in  hell  too  with  his  feelings - about  his parents, and a good many people in general.'\nI  believe this letter needs no  comment. It  simply means to  me  that as she  had experienced  in  therapy the satisfaction  of  being  herself,  of voicing  her  deep  feelings,  it  became  impossible  for  her  to  behave differently  with  her  husband. She  found  that  she had  to  be  and express  her  own  deepest  feelings,  even  if  this  seemed  to risk her marriage.\nAnother  element  in  the  experience  of  our  clients  is  a  somewhat subtle  one. They  find  that,  as  in  this  instance,  expression  of  feelings\nis  a deeply  satisfying  thing,  where  formerly  it  has  nearly  always seemed  destructive  and  disastrous. The  difference  seems  to  be  due to  this  fact. When  a  person  is  living  behind  a  front,  a  fagade,  his unexpressed  feelings  pile  up  to  some  explosion  point,  and  are  then apt  to  be  triggered  off  by  some  specific  incident. But  the  feelings which sweep over  the  person  and  are  expressed  at such  a  time - in a  temper storm,  in  a  deep  depression,  in  a  flood  of self-pity,  and  the like - often  have  an  unfortunate  effect  on  all  concerned  because they are so  inappropriate  to  the  specific  situation  and  hence  seem  so unreasonable. The  angry  flare-up  over  one  annoyance  in  the  re­ lationship  may  actually  be  the  pent-up  or  denied  feelings  resulting from  dozens  of  such  situations. But  in  the  context  in  which  it  is expressed it is unreasonable and hence not understood.\nHere  is  where  therapy  helps  to  break  a  vicious  circle. As  the client  is  able  to  pour  out,  in  all their  accumulated  anguish,  fury, or  despair,  the  emotions  which  he  has  been  feeling,  and  as  he  ac­ cepts  these  feelings  as  his  own,  they  lose  their  explosiveness.  Hence he  is  more  able  to  express,  in  any  specific  family  relationship,  the feelings  aroused  by  that  relationship. Since  they  do  not  carry  such an  overload  from  the  past,  they  are  more  appropriate,  and  more likely  to  be  understood. Gradually  the  individual  finds  himself  ex­ pressing his  feelings when  they  occur,  not  at some  much  later point after they have burned and festered in him.",

        "text": "There is another effect which counseling seems to hare on the way our clients experience their family relationships. The client discovers, often  to  his  great  surprise,  that  a  relationship  can  be  lived  on  the basis  of  the  real  feelings,  rather  than  on  the  basis  of  a  defensive pretense.  There is  a  deep  and  comforting significance  to  this,  as  we have  already seen  in  the  case  of  Mrs.  M. To  discover  that  feelings of  shame  and  anger  and  annoyance  can  be  expressed,  and  that  the relationship  still  survives,  is reassuring. To  find  that  one  can  ex­ press  tenderness  and  sensitivity  and  fearfulness  and  yet  not  be  be­ trayed - this  is  a  deeply  strengthening  thing. It  seems  that part of  the  reason  this  works  out  constructively  is  that  in  therapy  the individual  learns  to  recognize  and  express  his  feelings  as  his  own\nfeelings,  not  as  a  fact  about  another  person. Thus,  to  say  to  one's spouse  ' What  you  are  doing  is  all  wrong,'  is  likely  to  lead  only  to debate. But  to  say  ' I  feel  very  much  annoyed  by  what  you're  do­ ing,'  is  to  state  one  fact  about  the  speaker's  feelings,  a  fact  which no  one  can  deny. It  no  longer  is  an  accusation  about  another,  but a feeling which  exists  in  oneself. ' You  are  to  blame  for  m y  feelings of  inadequacy'  is  a  debatable  point,  but  ' I  feel  inadequate  when you do thus and so' simply contributes a real  fact about the relation­ ship.\nBut it is not only at the verbal  level that this operates.  The person who accepts his own feelings within himself,  finds that a  relationship can  be  lived  on  the  basis  of  these real  feelings. Let  me  illustrate this  with  a  scries  of  excerpts  from  the recorded  interviews  with Mrs. S.\nMrs.  S.  lived  with  her  ten  year  old  daughter  and  her  seventy year old  mother,  who  dominated  the  household  by  her  'poor  health.' Mrs.  S.  was  controlled  by  her  mother,  and  unable  to  control  her daughter,  Carol. She  felt  resentful  of  her  mother,  but  could  not express this, because ' I  have felt guilty all  my life. I  grew  up  feeling guilty  because  everything  that  I  did  I  felt  was  a  . . .   in  some  way affecting  my  mother's  health.  . . .   In  fact,  a  few  years  ago,  it  came to  the  point  where  I  was  having  dreams  at  night  about  .  .  .  shaking my  mother  and  . . .   I'd  . . .   I  got  the  feeling  that  I  just  wanted  to push  her  out  of  the  way. And  . . .   I can  understand  how  Carol might  feel. She  doesn't  dare  .  .  .  and  neither  do  I.'\nMrs.  S.  knows  that  most  people  think  she  would  be  much  better off if she  left  her mother,  but she  cannot. ' I  know  that if  I  do  leave her,  that  I  couldn't  possibly  be  happy,  I'd  be  so  worried  about  her. And I'd feel so badly about leaving a poor old lady alone.'\nAs she  complains  about  the  extent  to  which  she  is  dominated  and controlled,  she  begins  to  see the  part  she  is playing,  a  cowardly part. ' I  feel  that  m y  hands  are  tied. Perhaps  I'm  at  fault  .  .  .  more than  mother  is. In  fact  I know  I  am,  but  I've  sort  of  becomc  a coward  where mother's  concerned. I'll  do  anything  to  avoid  one  of the scenes that she puts on about little things.'\nAs  she  understands  herself  better  she  comes  to  an  inward  con­ clusion  to  try  to  live  in  the  relationship  according  to  what  she  be­\nlieves  is  right, rather  than  in  terms  of  her  mother's  wishes. She reports  this  at  the  beginning  of  an  interview. 'Well,  I've  made  a stupendous  discovery,  that  perhaps  it's  been  my  fault  entirely  in overcompensating  to  mother  . . .   in  other  words,  spoiling  her. So I  made  up  my  mind  like  I  do  every  morning,  but  I  think  this  time it's  gonna  work,  that  I  would  try  to  .  .  .  oh,  to  be  calm  and  quiet, and  . . .   if  she  does  go  into  one  of  her spells,  to  just  more  or  less  ig­ nore  it  as  you  would  a  child  who  throws  a  tantrum  just  to  get  at­ tention. So  I  tried  it. And  she  got  angry  over  some  little  thing. And  she  jumped  up  from  the  table  and  went  into  her  room. Well, I  didn't  rush  in  and  say,  oh,  I'm  sorry,  and  beg  her  to  come  back, and  I  simply  just  ignored  it. So  in  a  few  minutes,  why,  she  came back  and  sat  down  and  was  a  little  sulky  but  she  was  over  it. So I'm going to try that for a while an d .. . . '\nAirs.  S.  realizes  clearly  that  the  basis  for  her  new  behavior  is  that she has come  genuinely  to  acccpt  her  own  feelings  toward her mother.  She says,  'Well,  why  not face  it? You  see,  I've  been  feel­ ing so  horrible,  and  thinking  what  a  horrible  person  I  was  to  resent my mother.  Well,  let's  just  say,  okay,  I  resent  her;  and  I'm  sorry; but let's face it and I'll try to make the best of it.'\nAs  she  accepts  herself  more she  becomes  much  more  able  to meet  some  of her own  needs  as well as those of her mother. 'There's  a  lot  of  things  that  I've  wanted  to  do  for  years  and  that I'm  just  going  to  start  to  do. Now,  mother  can  be  alone  till  ten o'clock  at  night  there. She  has  a  telephone  by  her  bed  and  . . .   if  a fire  starts  or  something,  there  are  neighbors,  or  if  she  becomes  ill . . . so  I'm  going  to  take  some  night  courses  through  the  public schools  you  know,  and  I'm  going  to  do  a  lot  of  things  that  I've wanted  to  do all  my  life,  and  have  sort  of  been  a  martyr  in  staying home  resenting  it  .  .  . that  I  had  to,  and thinking,  oh,  well,  and not  doing  it. Well,  I'm  going  to  now. And  I  think  after  the  first time I go, why, she'll be all right.'\nHer new  found  feelings  are  soon  put  to  a  test  in  the  relationship with  her  mother. ' M y  mother  had  a  very  severe  heart  attack  the other  day  and  I  said,  well,  you'd  better  go  to  the  hospital  and  .  .  . and  you  certainly  need  hospitalization;  and  I  whipped  her  dow n to  the doctor, and  the  doctor said  her  heart was fine  and  she  oughta\nget  out  and  have  a  little  fun. So  she's  going  to  visit  a  friend  for  a week  and  see  the  shows  and  have  a  good  time. So  . . . actually when  it  came  down  to  getting  ready  to  go  to  the  hospital, how cruel  I  am  to  her  by  contradicting  her  in  front  of  Carol  and  all that  sort  of  thing,  why,  then  she  backed  down  and  when  she  was faced  with  the  fact  that  she  .  .  .  and  her  heart's  just  as  strong  as  a bull's,  why,  she  thought  she  might  as  well  use  it  to  have  some  fun with.  So that's fine.  W orking out fine.'\nUp  to  this  point  it  might  seem  as  though  the  relationship  had improved  for  Mrs.  S.,  but  not  for  her  mother. There  is,  however, another side  to  the  picture. Somewhat  later  Mrs.  S.  says  ' I  still  am very,  very  sorry  for  mother. I  would  hate  to  be  like  she  is. And another  thing,  you  know,  I  just  got  to  the  point  where  I  just  hated mother;  I  couldn't  stand  to  touch  her,  or  . . .   I  mean  .  .  .  brush against  her  or  something. I  don't  mean,  just  for  the  moment,  while I  was angry or anything.  But  .  . .   I've  also  found  myself,  oh,  feeling a little affectionate  toward  her;  two  or  three  times I've gone  in without  even  thinking,  kissed  her  goodnight,  and  I  used  to  just holler from the door.  And . . .  I've been  feeling kindlier toward her; that resentment  that  I've  had  is  going,  along  with  the  hold  that  she had  over me,  you  see. So  .  .  .  that,  I  noticed  that  yesterday  when  I was  helping  her  get  ready  and  so  forth;  I  fixed  her  hair  and  there was the  longest  time  I  couldn't  stand  to  touch  her;  and  I  was  doing her hair in pin curls and so  forth;  and  I  . . .   it  suddenly  came  to  me, well, now this doesn't bother me a bit; in fact it's kind of fun.'\nThese  excerpts  seem  to  me  to  portray  a  pattern  of  change  in family  relationships  which is very  familiar to us. Mrs.  S. feels, though  she  hardly  dares  admit  it  even  to  herself,  resentful  of  her mother  and  as  though  she  had  no  rights  of  her  own. It  seems  as though nothing but difficulty  could  result  from  letting these  feelings exist openly  in  the  relationship. Yet  as  she  tentatively  permits  them to  enter  the  situation  she  finds  herself  acting  with  more  assurance, more  integrity. The  relationship  improves  rather  than  deteriorates. Most surprising  of all,  when  the  relationship  is  lived  on  the  basis  of the real  feelings,  she  finds  that  resentment  and  hate  are  not  the  only feelings  she has  toward  her  mother. Fondness,  affection  and en­ joyment arc also feelings which enter the  relationship. It  seems  clear\nthat  there  may  be  moments  of  discord,  dislike,  and  anger  between the two.  But there will also be  respect and understanding and liking. They seem to have learned what many other clients have also learned, that  a  relationship  does  not  have  to  be  lived  on  a  basis  of  pretense, but  can  be  lived  on  the  basis  of  the  fluctuating  variety  of  feelings which actually exist.\nIt  may  seem,  from  the  illustrations  I  have  chosen,  that  it  is  only negative  feelings  which  are  difficult  to  express  or  live. This  is  far from true.  Mr.  K., a  young professional man,  found  it fully as  diffi­ cult  to  discover  the  positive  feelings  which  lay  beneath  his  fagade, as  the  negative. A  brief  excerpt  will  indicate  the  changed  quality of his relationship with his three-year-old daughter.\nHe  says,  ' The  thing  that  I  was  thinking  about  as  I  rode  down here  was - how  differently  I  see  our  little  girl - I  was  playing with  her  this  morning - and - we  just,  ah,  well - why  is  it  so hard  for  me  to  get  words  out  now? This  was  a  really  wonderful experience - very warm, and it was a happy and pleasant thing, and it seems that I  saw  and  felt  her  so  close  to  me. Here's  what  I  think is  significant- before,  I  could  talk  about  Judy. I could  say  posi­ tive  things  about  her  and  funny  little  things  she'd  do  and  just  talk about  her  as  though  I  were  and  felt  like  a  real  happy  father,  but there was  some  unreal  quality  . . .   as  though  I  was  just  saying  these things  because  I  should  be  feeling  this  stuff  and  this  is  the  way  a father should talk about his  daughter but somehow this wasn't really true  because  I  did  have  these  negative  and  mixed  up  feelings  about her. Now I  do  think  she  is  the  most  wonderful  kid  in  the  world.' T:  'Before,  you  felt  as  though  'I  should  be  a  happy  father' this morning you are a happy father...\n' It  certainly  felt  that  w ay  this  morning. She  just  rolled  around on  the  bed  .  .  .  and  then  she  asked  me  if  I  wanted  to  go  to  sleep again and  I  said  okay  and  then  she  said  well,  I'll  go  get  m y  blankets . .   . and then she told me  a  story  .  .  .  about  three stories  in  one  .  .  . all  jumbled  up  and  . . .   it  just  felt  like  this  is  what  I  really want . . . I want  to  have  this  experience. It  felt  that  I  was  . . . I felt grown  up,  I  guess. I felt  that  I was  a  man  .  .  .  now  this  sounds strange,  but it did  feel as though  I  was  a  grownup  responsible  loving father,  who  was  big  enough,  and  serious  enough,  and  also  happy\nenough  to  be  the  father  of  this  child. Whereas  before  I  did  feel weak and maybe almost undeserving,  ineligible  to  be  that important, because it is a very important thing to be a father.'\nHe has found it possible to accept  positive  feelings  toward  himself as  a  good  father,  and  to  fully  accept  this  warm  love  for  his  little girl. He  no  longer  has  to  pretend  he  loves  her,  fearful  that  some different feeling may be lurking underneath.\nI  think  it will  not surprise  you  that  shortly  after  this  he  told  how he  could  be  much  more  free  in  expressing  anger  and  annoyance  at his  little  daughter,  also. He  is  learning  that  the  feelings  which  exist are  good  enough  to  live  by. They  do  not  have  to  be  coated  with a veneer.",

        "text": "Experience  in  therapy seems  to  bring about another  change  in  the way our clients live  in  their  family  relationships. They  learn  some­ thing  about  how  to  initiate  and  maintain  real  two-way  communi­ cation. To understand another person's thoughts and feelings thoroughly,  with  the  meanings  they  have  for  him,  and  to  be  thor­ oughly  understood  by  this  other  person  in  return - this  is  one  of the most rewarding of human experiences,  and  all  too  rare. Individ­ uals  who  have  come  to  us  for therapy  often  report  their  pleasure  in discovering that  such  genuine  communication  is  possible  with  mem­ bers of their own families.\nIn  part  this seems  to  be  due,  quite  directly,  to  their  experience  of communication with the counselor.  It is such  a  relief,  such  a  blessed relaxation of defenses,  to  find oneself understood,  that the  individual wishes  to  create  this  atmosphere  for  others. To  find,  in  the  thera­ peutic relationship that one's most awful thoughts,  one's most bizarre and  abnormal  feelings, one's most  ridiculous dreams  and hopes, one's  most  evil  behaviors,  can  all  be  understood  by  another,  is  a tremendously releasing experience.  One begins to see it as a resource he could extend to others.\nBut  there  appears  to  be  an  even  more  fundamental  reason  why these  clicnts  can  understand  members  of  their  families. When  we are  living  behind  a  fagade,  when  we  are  trying  to  act  in  ways  that are  not  in  accord  with  our  feelings,  then  we  dare  not  listen  freely\nto  another. We must  always  have  our  guard  up,  lest  he  pierce  the pretense of our fagade.  But when a  client  is  living in  the  wav  I  have been  describing,  when  he  tends  to  express  his  real  feelings  in  the situation in which they occur,  when  his  family relationships are lived on  the  basis  of  the feelings  which actually exist, then he is no longer  defensive  and  he  can  really  listen  to,  and  understand,  an­ other member of  his  family. He can  let  himself see  how  life  appears to this other person.\nSomething  of  what  I  am  saying  may  be  illustrated  from  the  ex­ perience  of  Mrs.  S.,  the  woman  quoted  in  the  preceding  section. In  a  followup  contact  after  the  conclusion  of  her  interviews,  Mrs. S.  was  asked  to  give  some  of  her  own  reactions  to  her  experience. She  savs,  ' I  didn't  feel  at  first  that  it  was  counseling. You  know? I  thought, well,  I'm  just talking,  b u t . . .   by  giving  it  a  little  thought, I realize  that  it  is  counseling  and  of  the  very  best  kind,  because I've  had  advice,  and  excellent  advice  from  doctors  and  family  and friends  and  .  .  .  it's  never  worked. And  I  think  in  order  to  reach people,  you  can't  put  up  barriers  and  things  of  that  sort,  because then  you  don't  get  the  true  reaction.  .  .  .  But  I've  given  it  a  great deal  of  thought  and  I'm  sort  of  working  it  with  Carol  a  little  bit now  (laughing)  or  trying  to,  you  know. And  .  .  .  grandma  says to  her,  how can  you  be  so  mean  to  your  poor sick  old  grandmother, you  know.  And  I  just  know  how  Carol  feels. She  just wants  to  hit her  because  she's  so  terrible! But  I  sort  of  haven't  been  saying  too much  to  Carol  or  trying  to  guide  her. But  I've  been  trying  to draw  her  out  .  .  .  lcr  her  feel  that  I'm  with  her  and  behind  her,  no matter  what  she  does. And  let  her  tell  me  how  she  feels,  and  her little reactions  to  things,  and  it's  working  out  fine. She  has  told me,  oh,  grandma's  been  old  and  sick  for  so  long,  mother. And  I said,  yes. And  I  don't  condemn  her  nor  do  I  praise  her,  and  so  she is,  just  in  this  short  time  beginning  to  .  .  .  oh,  get  little  things  off her  mind  and  .  .  .  without  my  probing  or  trying  to  . . .   so  it's  sort of working  on  her. And  it  seems  to  be  working  on  mother  a  little bit  too.'\nI  think  we  may say  of Airs.  S.  that  having  accepted  her  own  feel­ ings,  and  having  been  more  willing  to  express  them  and  to  live  in them, she now finds more willingness on her own  part to understand\nher  daughter  and  her  mother,  nnd  to  feel  empathically  their  own reactions  to  life. She  is  sufficiently  free  of  defensiveness  to  be  able to  listen in  an  accepting  manner,  and  to  sense  the  way  life feels to them. This  kind of development  seems  characteristic of the change which occurs in the family life of our clients.",

        "text": "There  is  one  final  tendency  which  we  have  noticed  and  which I  would  like  to  describe. It  is  quite  noticeable  that  our  clients  tend in  the  direction  of  permitting  each  member  of  the  family  to  have his  own  feelings  and  to  be  a  separate person. This  may  seem  a strange  statement,  but  it  is  actually  a  most  radical  step. Many  of us are  perhaps  unaware  of  the  tremendous  pressure  we  tend  to  put on  our  wives,  our  husbands,  our  children,  to  have  the  same  feel­ ings  we  do. It  is  often  as  though  we  said,  ' If  you  want  me  to  love you,  then  you  must  have  the  same  feelings  I  do. If I feel your behavior  is  bad,  you  must  feel  so  too. If  I feel  a  certain  goal  is desirable,  you  must  feel  so  too.' Now  the  tendency  which  we  see in  our  clients  is  the  opposite  of  this. There  is  a  willingness  for  the other  person  to  have  different  feelings,  different values,  different goals. In  short,  there  is  a  willingness  for  him  to  be  a  separate  per­ son.\nIt  is  m y  belief  that  this  tendency  develops  as  the  person  discovers that  he  can  trust  his  own  feelings  and  reactions - that  his  own  deep impulses  are  not  destructive  or  catastrophic,  and  that  he himself need  not  be  guarded,  but  can  meet  life  on  a  real  basis. As  he  thus learns that he can trust himself,  with  his  own  uniqueness,  he becomes more  able  to  trust  his  wife,  or  his  child,  and  to  accept  the  unique feelings and values which exist in this other person.\nSomething  of what  I  mean  is  contained  in  letters  from  a  woman and  her  husband. They  are  friends  of  mine  and  had  obtained  a copy  of  a  book  I  had  written  because  they  were  interested  in  what I was  doing. But  the  effcct  of  the  book  seemed  to  be  similar  to therapy. The  wife  wrote  me  and  included  in  her  letter  a  para­ graph  giving  her  reactions. ' Lest  you  think  that  we  are  completely frivolous,  we  have  been  reading  Client-Centered  Therapy. I have almost  finished  it. Most  of  the  usual  things  you  say  about  books\ndon't  apply,  at  least  for  me. In  fact  it  was  pretty  close  to  a  coun­ seling  experience. It set me  to thinking  about  some  of  the  un­ satisfactory relationships in our family, particularly my  attitude toward  Phillip  (her  14-vear-old  son). I  realized  that  I  hadn't  shown him  any  real  love  for  a  long  time,  because  I was  so  resentful  of his  apparent  indifference  in trying  to  measure  up  to  any  of  the standards  that  I  have  always  thought  were  important. Since  I  have stopped  taking  most  of  the  responsibility  for  his  goals, and  have responded  to  him  as  a  person,  as  I always  have  to  Nancy,  for  in­ stance,  it  is  surprising  what  changes  have  appeared  in  his  attitudes. Not earth-shaking - but  a  heartwarming  beginning. We no  longer heckle  him about his school work,  and  the  other  day  he  volunteered that  he  had  gotten  an  S - satisfactory  grade - on  a  math  exam. The first time this year.'\nA  few  months  later  I  heard  from  her  husband. ' You  wouldn't recognize  Phil.  .  .  .  W hile  he  is  hardly  garrulous,  he  is  not  nearly the  sphinx  that  he  was,  and  he  is  doing  much  better  in  school,  al­ though  we  do  not  expect  him  to  be  graduated  cum  laudc. You should  take  a  great  deal  of  credit  for  his  improvement,  because  he began  to  blossom  when  I  finally  began  to  trust  him  to  be  himself, and ceased trying to  mold  him  into  the  glorified  image  of  his  father at a similar age. Oh to undo our past errors!'\nThis concept of trusting  the  individual  to  be  himself  has  come  to have a great deal  of meaning to me. I  sometimes fantasy  about what it  would  mean  if  a  child  were  treated  in  this  fashion  from  the  first. Suppose  a  child  were  permitted  to  have  his  own  unique  feelings suppose  he  never  had  to  disown  his  feelings  in  order  to  be  loved. Suppose his  parents  were  free  to  have  and  express  their  own  unique feelings,  which  often  would  be  different  from  his,  and  often  dif­ ferent  between  themselves. I like  to  think  of  all  the  meanings  that such an experience would  have.  It would  mean  that the  child  would grow up  respecting  himself as  a  unique  person. It  would  mean  that even  when  his  behavior  had  to  be  thwarted,  he  could  retain  open ' ownership'  of  his  feelings. It  would  mean  that  his  behavior would be  a  realistic  balance,  taking  into  account  his  own  feelings  and  the known  and  open  feelings  of  others. He  would,  I  believe,  be  a  re­ sponsible  and  self-directing  individual,  who  would  never  need  to\nconceal  his  feelings from  himself,  who  would  never  need  to  live behind  a  fagade. He  would  be  relatively  free  of  the maladjust­ ments which cripple so many of us.",

        "text": "If I  have been able correctly to discern the trends in the experience of our  clients,  then  client-centered  therapy seems  to  have  a  number of  implications  for  family  life. Let  me  attempt  to  restate  these  in somew hat more general form.\nIt  appears  that  an  individual  finds  it  satisfying  in  the  long  run to  express  any  strong  or  persistent  emotional  attitudes  in  the  situa­ tion  in  w  hich  they  arise,  to  the  person  with  whom  they  are  con­ cerned,  and  to  the  depth  to  which  they  exist. This  is  more  satisfy­ ing  than  refusing  to  admit  that  such  feelings  exist, or  permitting them  to  pile  up  to  an  explosive  degree,  or  directing  them  toward some situation other than the one in which they arose.\nIt  seems  that  the  individual  discovers  that  it  is  more  satisfying  in the  long  run  to  live  a  given  family  relationship  on  the  basis  of  the real interpersonal  feelings  which  exist,  rather  than living  the re­ lationship  on the  basis of  a  pretense. A part of this  discovery  is  that the  fear  that  the  relationship  will  be  destroyed  if  the  true  feelings are admitted, is usually unfounded, particularly when the  feelings are expressed  as  belonging  to  oneself,  not  as  stating  something  about the other person.\nOur  clients  find  that  as  they  express  themselves  more  freely,  as the  surface  character  of  the  relationship  matches  more  closely  the fluctuating  attitudes  which  underlie  it,  they  can  lay  aside  some  of their  defenses  and  truly  listen  to  the  other  person. Often  for  the first  time  they  begin  to  understand  how  the  other  person  feels,  and why  he  feels  that  wav. Thus  mutual  understanding  begins  to  per­ vade the interpersonal interaction.\nFinally,  there  is  an  increasing  willingness  for  the  other  person  to be  himself. As  I  am  more  willing  to  be  myself,  I  find  I  am  more ready  to  permit  vou  to  be  yourself,  with  all  that  that  implies. This means  that  the  family  circle  tends  in  the  direction  of  becoming  a number  of  separate  and  unique  persons  with  individual  goals  and values, but bound  together by the real feelings - positive and\nnegative - which  exist  between  them,  and  by  the  satisfying  bond of mutual  understanding of  at  least  a  portion  of each  other's  private worlds.\nIt  is  in  these  ways,  I  believe,  that  a  therapy  which  results  in  the individual  becoming  more  fully  and  more  deeply  himself,  results also  in  his  finding  greater  satisfaction  in  realistic  family  relation­ ships  which  likewise  promote  the  same  end - that  of  facilitating each  member  of  the  family  in  the  process  of  discovering,  and  be­ coming, himself.\nDealing With  Breakdowns in  Communication Interpersonal  and  Intergroup\nI n point  of  time,  this paper  is  the  earliest  in  the  book.  It  was  writ­ ten  in  1951 for  presentation  at  the  Centennial  Conference  on Communications at Northwestern  University, where it was given the titley ' Communication:  Its  Blocking  and  Its  F a c ilit a t io n I t has since  been  reprinted  a  half-dozen  times,  by different  groups  and m different  journals,  including  the  Harvard  Business  Review  and ETC, the journal of the Society  for General Semantics.\nAlthough  some  of  its  illustrations  now  appear  a  bit  dated,  1  am including  it  because  it  makes  what  1  feel  is  an  important  point  re­ garding  group  tensions,  national  and  international. The  suggestion regarding Russian-U.S.  tensions appeared hopelessly  idealistic at  that time. Now 1  believe  it  would  be  accepted  by  many  as  good  sense.\n&\nI t m a y s e e m c u r io u s that  a  person  whose  whole  professional  ef­ fort  is  devoted  to  psychotherapy  should  be  interested  in  prob­ lems of communication. YVhat relationship is there between 329\nproviding  therapeutic  help to individuals  with emotional malad­ justments and  the concern  of this  conference  with  obstacles  to  com­ munication? Actually  the  relationship  is  very  close  indeed. The whole  task  of  psychotherapy  is  the  task  of  dealing  with  a  failure  in communication. The  emotionally  maladjusted  person, the ' neu­ rotic,'  is  in  difficulty  first,  because  communication  within  himself has  broken  down,  and  second  because,  as  a  result  of  this,  his  com­ munication  with  others  has  been  damaged. If  this  sounds  somewhat strange  to  you,  then  let me  put  it  in  other  terms. In  the  ' neurotic' individual,  parts  of  himself which  have  been  termed  unconscious,  or repressed,  or  denied  to  awareness,  become  blocked  off  so  that  they no  longer  communicate  themselves  to  the  conscious  or  managing part  of  himself. As  long  as  this  is  true,  there  are  distortions  in  the way  he  communicates  himself  to  others,  and  so he  suffers both within himself, and in his interpersonal relations. The  task of psychotherapy  is  to  help  the  person  achieve,  through  a  special  re­ lationship with  a therapist, good  communication  within  himself. Once  this  is  achieved  he  can  communicate  more  freely  and  more effectively  with  others. Wre  may  say  then  that  psychotherapy  is good  communication,  within  and  between  men. We  may  also  turn that  statement  around  and  it  will  still  be  true. Good  communica­ tion,  free  communication,  within  or  between  men,  is  always  thera­ peutic.\nIt  is,  then,  from  a  background  of  experience  with  communication in  counseling  and  psychotherapy,  that  I  want  to  present  to  you tonight two  ideas. I  wish  to  state  what  I  believe  is  one  of  the  major factors  in  blocking  or  impeding  communication,  and  then  I  wish to present what in our experience has proven  to  be a  very  important way of improving or facilitating communication.\nI  would  like  to  propose,  as  an  hypothesis  for  consideration,  that the major barrier to  mutual interpersonal communication is our very natural tendency to judge,  to  evaluate,  to approve or  disapprove,  the statement of the  other person,  or  the  other  group. Let me  illustrate my  meaning  with  some  very  simple  examples. As  you  leave  the meeting  tonight,  one  of  the  statements  you  are  likely  to  hear  is,  'I didn't  like  that  man's  talk.' Now  what  do  you  respond? Almost invariably  your  reply  will  be  either  approval  or  disapproval  of  the\nattitude  expressed. Either  you  respond,  ' I  didn't  either. I  thought it  was  terrible,'  or  else  you  tend  to  reply,  ' Oh,  I  thought  it  was really  good.' In  other  words,  your  primary  reaction  is  to  evaluate what  has  just  been  said  to  you,  to  evaluate  it  from  your  point  of view, your own frame of reference.\nOr  take  another  example. Suppose  I  say  with  some  feeling,  ' I think  the  Republicans  are  behaving  in  ways that show a  lot of good sound sense these days,' what is the response that arises in your mind as you  listen? The overwhelming likelihood is that it will be  evalua­ tive. You  will  find  yourself  agreeing, or  disagreeing, or  making some  judgment  about  me  such  as  ' He  must  be  a  conservative,'  or ' He  seems  solid  in  his  thinking.' Or let  us  take  an  illustration  from the  international  scene. Russia  says  vehemently,  'The  treaty  with Japan  is  a  war  plot  on  the  part  of  the  United  States.' We  rise  as one person to say 'That's a lie!'\nThis last illustration brings in  another element connected  with my hypothesis. Although  the  tendency  to  make  evaluations  is  common in  almost  all  interchange  of  language,  it  is  very  much  heightened  in those situations where feelings  and  emotions are  deeply involved.  So the  stronger  our  feelings  the  more  likely  it  is  that  there  will  be  no mutual element in the communication.  There will  be just two ideas, two  feelings,  two  judgments,  missing  each  other  in  psychological space.  I'm sure you recognize this from your own experience.  When you  have  not been  emotionally  involved  yourself,  and  have  listened to  a heated  discussion,  you  often  go  away  thinking,  ' Well,  they actually  weren't talking about the  same thing.'  And they were not. Each was making a  judgment,  an  evaluation,  from  his  own  frame of reference.  There was really nothing which could be called communi­ cation  in  any  genuine  sense. This  tendency  to  react  to  any  emo­ tionally  meaningful  statement  by  forming  an  evaluation  of  it  from our own point of view, is, I  repeat, the major  barrier to  interpersonal communication.\nBut  is  there  any  way  of  solving  this  problem,  of  avoiding  this barrier? I  feel  that we are  making exciting progress toward  this goal and I would like to present it as simply as I can.  Real communication occurs,  and  this  evaluative  tendency  is avoided,  when  we  listen  with understanding.  W hat does  this mean? It  means  to  see  the  expressed\nidea and attitude from the other person's point of view, to sense  how it feels to him, to achieve his frame o f reference in regard to the thing he is talking about.\nStated  so  briefly,  this  may  sound  absurdly  simple,  but  it  is  not It is  an approach  which we  have  found  extremely potent in the  field of psychotherapy.  It  is  the  most effective  agent we  know for alter­ ing  the  basic  personality  structure  of  an  individual,  and  improving his  relationships  and  his  communications  with  others. If  I  can  listen to  what he  can tell me,  if I  can  understand  how  it seems to  him,  if  I can  see  its  personal  meaning  for  him,  if  I  can  sense  the  emotional flavor which  it  has  for  him,  then  I  will  be  releasing  potent  forces  of change in him.  If I  can really understand how he  hates his father, or hates the  university,  or  hates  communists - if  I  can  catch  the  flavor of  his  fear  of  insanity,  or  his  fear  of  atom  bombs,  or  of  Russia - it will be of the greatest help to  him in altering those  very  hatreds and fears,  and  in  establishing  realistic  and  harmonious  relationships  with the  very  people  and  situations  toward  which  he  has  felt  hatred  and fear. We  know  from  our  research  that  such  empathic  understand­ ing - understanding 'with a person, not about him - is such an effec­ tive  approach  that  it  can  bring  about  major  changes  in  personality.\nSome  of  you  may  be  feeling  that  you  listen  well  to  people,  and that  you  have  never  seen  such  results. The  chances  are  very  great indeed  that your listening has not been of  the  type  I  have described. Fortunately  I  can  suggest  a  little  laboratory  experiment  which  you can  try  to  test  the  quality  of  your  understanding. The  next  time you get  into  an  argument with  your wife,  or  your friend,  or  with  a small group  of friends, just stop the  discussion  for a moment and  for an  experiment,  institute  this  rule. ' Each  person  can  speak  up  for himself  only  after  he  has  first  restated  the  ideas  and  feelings  of  the previous speaker accurately,  and  to  that speaker's satisfaction.'  You see  what  this  would  mean. It  would  simply  mean  that  before  pre­ senting  your  own  point  of  view,  it  would  be  necessary  for  you  to really  achieve  the  other  speaker's  frame  of  reference -  to  under­ stand  his  thoughts  and  feelings  so  well  that  you  could  summarize them  for  him. Sounds simple,  doesn't  it? But  if  you  try  it  you  will discover it  is  one  of the  most  difficult  things  you  have  ever  tried  to do. However,  once  you  have  been  able  to  see  the  other's  point  of\nview,  your  own  comments  will  have  to  be  drastically  revised. You will also  find  the emotion going  out of the  discussion,  the  differences being  reduced,  and  those  differences  which  remain  being  of  a  ra­ tional and understandable sort.\nCan you  imagine  what  this  kind  of  an  approach  would  mean  if  it were  projected  into  larger  areas? What  would  happen  to  a  labormanagement  dispute  if  it  was  conducted  in  such  a  way  that  labor, without  necessarily  agreeing,  could  accuratcly  state  management's point of  view  in  a  way  that  management could  accept;  and manage­ ment,  without  approving  labor's  stand,  could  state  labor's  case  in  a way that  labor  agreed  was  accurate? It  would  mean  that  real  com­ munication was established,  and one  could  practically  guarantee that some reasonable solution would be reached.\nIf  then  this  way  of  approach  is  an  effective  avenue  to  good  com­ munication and  good  relationships,  as I  am  quite  sure  you  will  agree if  you  try  the  experiment  I  have  mentioned,  why  is  it  not  more w idely  tried  and  used? I  will  try  to  list the  difficulties which  keep  it from being utilized.\nIn the first  place  it takes  courage,  a  quality which  is not  too  wide­ spread. I  am  indebted  to  Dr.  S.  I.  Hayakawa,  the  semanticist,  for pointing out that to carry  on psychotherapy in this  fashion  is to take a  very  real  risk,  and  that  courage  is  required. If  you  really  under­ stand  another  person  in  this way,  if you  are  willing  to  enter  his  pri­ vate  world and see  the way  life  appears to  him,  without  any attempt to  make  evaluative  judgments,  you  run  the  risk  of  being  changed yourself. You  might  see  it  his  way,  you  might  find  yourself  in­ fluenced  in  your  attitudes  or  your  personality. This  risk  of  being changed  is  one  of  the  most  frightening  prospects  most  of  us  can face. If  1 enter,  as  fully  as  I  am  able,  into  the  private  world  of  a neurotic  or  psychotic  individual,  isn't  there  a  risk  that  I  might  be­ come  lost  in  that  world? Most of  us are  afraid  to  take  that  risk. Or if we  had  a  Russian  communist  speaker  here  tonight,  or  Senator Joseph McCarthy, how many of us would dare to try to sec the world from  each  of  these  points  of  view? The  great  majority  of  us could not  listen;  we  would  find  ourselves  compelled  to  evaluate,  because listening  would  seem  too dangerous. So  the first requirement  is courage, and we do not always have it.\n334\nBut  there  is a second  obstacle. It is just when  emotions  are strongest that it is most difficult to  achieve the frame of reference  of the  other  person  or  group. Yet  this  is  the  time  the  attitude  is  most needed,  if  communication  is  to  be  established. We  have  not  found this to be an insuperable obstacle in our experience in psychotherapy. A  third  party,  who  is  able  to  lay  aside  his  own  feelings  and  evalua­ tions,  can  assist  greatly by  listening with  understanding  to  each  per­ son  or  group  and  clarifying the  views and  attitudes each  holds.  W e have  found  this  very  effective  in  small  groups  in  which  contradic­ tory  or  antagonistic  attitudes  exist. When  the  parties  to  a  dispute realize  that  they  are  being  understood,  that  someone  sees  how  the situation  seems  to  them,  the  statements  grow  less  exaggerated  and less  defensive,  and  it  is  no  longer  necessary  to  maintain  the  attitude, ' I am  100  per  cent  right  and  you  are  100  per  cent  wrong.' The influence  of such  an understanding catalyst in  the  group  permits the members to come closer  and closer to the objective truth involved in the  relationship. In  this  w ay  mutual  communication  is  established and  some  type  of  agreement  becomes  much  more  possible. So  we may say that though  heightened  emotions make  it  much  more  diffi­ cult  to  understand  'with  an  opponent,  our  experience  makes  it clear that  a neutral,  understanding,  catalyst  type  of  leader  or  therapist can  overcome  this  obstacle  in  a  small  group.\nThis  last  phrase,  however,  suggests  another  obstacle  to  utilizing the approach I  have  described. Thus far all  our  experience  has been with  small  face-to-face  groups - groups  exhibiting  industrial  ten­ sions,  religious tensions,  racial tensions,  and  therapy groups  in which many personal tensions are present.  In these small groups our experi­ ence,  confirmed  by  a  limited  amount  of  research,  shows  that  a  lis­ tening, empathic  approach  leads  to improved  communication,  to greater  acceptance  of  others  and  by  others,  and  to  attitudes  which are  more  positive  and  more  problem-solving  in  nature. There  is  a decrease  in  defensiveness, in exaggerated  statements,  in  evaluative and  critical  behavior. But  these findings  are from  small  groups. What about trying to  achieve  understanding  between  larger  groups that  are  geographically  remote? Or  between  face-to-face  groups who  are  not  speaking  for  themselves,  but  simply  as  representatives of others,  like  the  delegates  at  the  United  Nations? Frankly  we  do\nnot  know  the  answers  to  these  questions. I jelieve  the  situation might be  put this  way. As  social  scientists  we  have a  tentative  testtube  solution  of the  problem  of  breakdown  in  communication. But to  confirm  the  validity  of  this  test-tube  solution,  and  to  adapt  it  to the enormous  problems of communication breakdown  between classes,  groups,  and  nations,  would  involve  additional  funds,  much more  research,  and  creative  thinking  of  a  high  order.\nEven  with  our  present  limited  knowledge  we  can  see  some  steps which  might  be  taken,  even in  large  groups,  to  increase  the  amount of  listening  with,  and  to  decrease  the  amount  of  evaluation  about. To be imaginative for a moment, let us suppose that a therapeutically oriented  international  group  went  to  the  Russian  leaders  and  said, 'We  want  to  achieve  a  genuine  understanding  of  your  views  and even  more  important,  of  your  attitudes  and  feelings,  toward  the United  States. We  will  summarize  and  resummarize  these  views and  feelings  if necessary,  until you  agree  that  our description  repre­ sents  the  situation  as  it  seems  to  you.' Then  suppose  they  did  the same  thing  with  the  leaders  in  our  own  country. If they  then  gave the widest possible  distribution to  these  two  views,  with  the  feelings clearly  described  but  not  expressed  in  name-calling,  might  not  the effect  be  very  great? It  would  not  guarantee  the  type  of  under­ standing  I  have  been  describing,  but  it  would  make  it  much  more possible. We can understand  the  feelings  of  a  person  who  hates  us much  more  readily  when  his  attitudes  are  accurately  described  to us  by  a  neutral  third  party,  than  we  can  when  he  is  shaking  his fist  at  us.\nBut even to describe such a first step is to  suggest another obstacle to this  approach  of  understanding. Our  civilization  does  not  yet have enough faith in the social sciences to utilize their  findings.  The opposite  is  true  of  the  physical  sciences. During  the  war  when  a test-tube  solution  was  found  to  the  problem  of  synthetic  rubber, millions  of  dollars  and  an  army  of  talent  was  turned  loose  on  the problem  of using that finding.  If synthetic  rubber  could  be  made  in milligrams,  it  could  and  would  be  made  in  the  thousands  of  tons. And  it  was. But  in  the  social  science  realm,  if  a  way  is  found  of facilitating communication and mutual understanding in small groups,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  finding  will  be  utilized. It\nnmy be a generation or  more before the money and the brains will be turned  loose  to  exploit  that  finding.\nIn  closing,  1   would  like  to  summarize  this  small-scale  solution  to the  problem  of  barriers  in  communication,  and  to  point  out  certain of  its  characteristics.\nI have  said  that  our  research  and  experience  to  date  would  make it appear  that  breakdowns  in  communication,  and  the evaluative tendency  which is the major  barrier  to communication,  can  be avoided. The  solution  is  provided  by  creating  a  situation  in  which each  of  the  different parties comes  to  understand  the  other  from  the other's  point  of  view. This  has been  achieved,  in practice,  even when  feelings  run  high,  by  the  influence  of  a  person  who  is  willing to  understand  each  point  of  view  empathically,  and  who  thus  acts as  a  catalyst  to  precipitate  further  understanding.\nThis  procedure  has  important  characteristics. It  can  be  initiated by one party,  without waiting for the other to  be  ready.  It can even be  initiated  by  a  neutral  third  person,  providing  he  can  gain  a  mini­ mum of cooperation  from  one  of the parties.\nThis procedure can deal with the insincerities,  the  defensive  exag­ gerations,  the  lies,  the  ' false fronts'  which  characterize  almost  every failure  in  communication. These  defensive  distortions  drop  away with  astonishing  speed  as  people  find  that  the  only  intent  is  to  un­ derstand,  not  judge.\nThis  approach  leads  steadily  and  rapidly  toward  the  discovery of  the  truth,  toward  a  realistic  appraisal  of  the  objective  barriers to communication. The  dropping  of  some  defensiveness  by  one party  leads  to  further  dropping  of  defensiveness  by  the  other  party, and truth is thus approached.\nThis procedure gradually achieves mutual communication.  Mutual communication tends to be pointed toward solving a problem  rather than  toward  attacking  a  person  or  group. It  leads  to  a  situation  in which  I  see  how  the  problem  appears  to  you,  as  well  as  to  me,  and you  see  how  it  appears  to  me,  as  well  as  to  you. Thus  accurately and  realistically  defined,  the  problem  is  almost  certain  to  yield  to intelligent  attack,  or  if  it  is  in  part  insoluble,  it  will  be  com fortably accepted  as  such.\nThis  then  appears  to  be  a  test-tube  solution  to  the  breakdown  of\ncommunication as  it  occurs  in  small  groups. Can  we  take  this  small scale  answer,  investigate  it  further,  refine  it,  develop  it  and  apply it  to  the  tragic  and  well-nigh  fatal  failures  of  communication  which threaten  the  very  existence  of  our  modern  world? It  seems  to  me that  this  is  a  possibility  and  a  challenge  which  we  should  explore.\n18\nA Tentative  Formulation  of a  General  Law  of Interpersonal Relationships\nD uring  a  recent  summer  1  gave  some  thought  to  a  theoretical proble?n  which  had  tantalized  me:  Would  it  be  possible  to formulate, in  one  hypothesis,  the  elements which make any  relation­ ship  either  growth-facilitating  or  the  reverse. I  worked  out a  short document for myself, and had occasion  to  try  it  out on a workshop group  and some  industrial  executives  with  whom  I  was  conferring. It seemed to be of interest to all, but most stimulating to the industrial leaders  who  discussed  it  pro  and  con  in  terms  of  such  problems  as: supervisor-supervisee  relationships;  labor-management  relationships; executive  training;  interpersonal  relations  among  top  management. 1 regard this as a highly  tentative document, and am not at all sure of  its  adequacy. I  include  it  because  many  who  have  read  it  have found  it  provocative,  and  because  publication  of  it  may  inspire  re­ search  studies which  would  begin  to  test  its  validity.\nX\nI have  m a n y   t i m e s   a s k e d   m yself  how  our  learnings  in  the  field  of psychotherapy  apply to  human  relationships in  general.  During recent years  I  have  thought much  about this  issue  and  attempted  to\n338\nstate  a  theory  of  interpersonal  relationships  as  a  part  of  the  larger structure  of  theory  in  client-ccntered  therapy  (1,  Sec.  IV ). This present  document  undertakes  to  spell  out,  in  a  somewhat  different way,  one  of  the  aspects  of  that  theory. It  endeavors  to  look  at  a perccived  underlying orderliness in all  human relationships, an order which determines whether the relationship will make for the growth, enhancement,  openness,  and development  of  both  individuals  or whether  it  will  make  for  inhibition  of  psychological  growth,  for defensiveness  and  blockage  in  both  parties.",

        "text": "Fundamental to  much  of what I  wish  to  say  is  the  term  'congru­ ence.' This  construct  has  been developed  to  cover  a  group  of phenomena which seem important to therapy and to all interpersonal interaction. I  would  like  to  try  to  define  it.\nCongruence  is  the  term  we  have  used  to  indicate  an  accurate matching  of  experiencing  and  awareness. It  may  be  still  further extended  to  cover  a  matching  of  experience,  awareness,  and  com­ munication. Perhaps  the  simplest  example  is  an  infant. If  he  is  ex­ periencing  hunger  at  the  physiological  and  visceral  level,  then  his awareness  appears  to  match  this  experience,  and  his  communication is  also  congruent  with  his  experience. He  is  hungry  and  dissatisfied, and  this  is  true  of  him  at  all  levels. He  is  at  this  moment integrated or  unified  in  being  hungry. On  the  other  hand  if  he  is  satiated  and content this too  is a  unified  congruence,  similar  at  the  visceral  level, the  level  of  awareness  and  the  level  of  communication. He  is  one unified  person  all  the  way  through,  whether  we  tap  his  experience at  the  visceral  level,  the  level  of  his  awareness,  or  the  level  of  com­ munication.  Probably  one  of  the  reasons  why  most  people  respond to infants  is  that they  are so completely  genuine,  integrated  or congruent. If  an  infant  expresses  affection  or  anger  or  contentment or  fear  there  is  no  doubt  in  our  minds  that  he  is  this  experience,  all the way through.  He is transparently  fearful or loving or  hungry or whatever.\nFor  an  example  of  incongruence  we  must  turn  to  someone  be­ yond  the  stage  of  infancy. To  pick  an  easily  recognizable  example take  the  man  who  becomes  angrily  involved  in  a  group  discussion. His  face  flushes,  his  tone  communicates  anger,  he  shakes  his  finger\n340\nat  his  opponent. Yet when  a  friend  says,  ' Well,  let's  not  get  angry about  this,'  he  replies,  with  evident  sincerity  and  surprise,  'I'm  not angrv! I  don't have any feeling about this at all! I  was just pointing out  the  logical  facts.' The  other  men  in  the  group  break  out  in laughter  at  this  statement.\nWhnt  is  happening  here? It  seems  clear  that  at  a  physiological level  he  is  experiencing anger.  This is not  matched  by his awareness. Consciously  he  is  not  experiencing  anger,  nor  is  he  communicating this  (so  far  as he  is consciously aware).  There is a  real  incongruence between experience and awareness,  and between  experience  and communication.\nAnother  point  to be noted here is that his communication  is actually  ambiguous  and  unclear. In  its  words  it  is  a  setting  forth of  logic  and  fact. In  its  tone,  and  in  the  accompanying  gestures,  it is  carrying  a  very  different  message - ' I  am  angry  at  you.' I  be­ lieve  this ambiguity  or contradictorincss of communication is always present when  a  person who is at that moment incongruent endeavors to  communicate.\nStill  another  facet  of  the  concept  of  incongruence  is  illustrated by  this  example. The  individual  himself  is  not  a  sound  judge  of  his own  degree  of  congruence. Thus  the  laughter  of  the  group  indi­ cates a dear consensual  judgment that the man  is experiencing anger, whether or not he thinks so. Yet in  his own awareness this is not true. In  other  words  it  appears  that  the  degree  of  congruence  cannot  he evaluated  by  the  person  himself  at  that  moment. We  may  make progress  in  learning  to  measure  it  from  an  external  frame  of  refer­ ence. We  have  also  learned  much  about  incongruence  from  the person's own ability to  recognize incongruence in himself in the past. Thus if the man of our example were in therapy, he might look back on  this  incident  in  the  acceptant  safety  of  the  therapeutic  hour  and say,  ' I  realize  now  I  was  terribly  angry  at  him,  even  though  at  the time  I  thought  I  was  not.' He  has,  we  say,  come  to  recognize  that his  defensiveness  at  that  moment  kept  him  from  being aware  of  his anger.\nOne  more  example  will  portray  another  aspect  of  incongruence. Mrs.  Brown,  who  has  been  stifling  yawns  and  looking  at  her  watch for  hours,  says  to  her  hostess  on  departing,  ' I  enjoyed  this  evening\nso  much. It  was  a  delightful  party.' Here  the  incongruence  is  not between  experience  and  awareness. Mrs.  Browrn  is  well  aware  that she is bored.  The incongrucncc  is between awareness and communi­ cation. Thus it  might  be  noted  that  when  there  is  an  incongrucnce between  experience  and  awareness,  it  is  usually  spoken  of  as  dcfcnsivenessr or  denial  to  awareness.  When  the  incongruence  is  between awareness and communication  it is  usually  thought  of  as  falseness or deceit.\nThere  is  an  important  corollary  of  the  construct  of  congruence which  is  not  at  all  obvious. It  may  be  stated  in  this  way. If  an individual is at this moment entirely  congruent,  his actual physiolog­ ical experience  being  accurately  represented  in  his  awareness,  and his  communication  being  accurately  congruent  with  his  awareness, then  his  communication  could  never  contain  an  expression  of  an external  fact. If  he  was  congruent  he  could  not  say,  'That  rock  is hard' ;  ' He  is  stupid' ;  ' You  are  bad' ;  or  ' She  is  intelligent.' The reason  for  this  is  that  wc  never  experience  such  ' facts.' Accurate awareness of experience  would  always  be  expressed  as  feelings,  per­ ceptions,  meanings  from  an  internal  frame  of  reference. I never know that he is stupid  or  you  are  bad. I  can  only  pcrceive  that you seem  this  way  to  me. Likewise,  strictly  speaking  I  do  not  know that  the  rock  is  hard,  even  though  I  may  be  very  sure  that  I  experi­ ence  it  as  hard  if  I  fall  down  on  it. (And  even  then  I  can  permit the  physicist  to  perceive  it  as  a  very  permeable  mass  of  high-speed atoms  and  molecules.) If  the  person  is  thoroughly  congruent  then it  is  clear  that  all  of  his  communication  would  necessarily  be  put  in a  context  of  personal  perception. This  has  very  important  impli­ cations.\nAs  an  aside  it  might  be  mentioned  that  for  a  person  always  to speak  from  a  context  of  personal  perception  does  not  necessarily imply  congruence,  since  any  mode  of  expression  may  be  used  as  a type  of  defensiveness. Thus the  person  in  a  moment  of  congruence would necessarily communicate  his perceptions and  feelings as being these,  and  not  as  being  facts  about  another  person  or  the  outside world. The  reverse  does  not  necessarily  hold,  however.\nPerhaps  I  have  said  enough  to  indicate  that  this  concept  of  con­ gruence is a somewhat complex concept with a number of character­\n342\nistics  and  implications. It  is  not  easily  defined  in  operational  terms, though  some  studies  have  been  completed  and  others  arc  in  process which  do  provide  crude  operational  indicators  of  what  is  being experienced,  as  distinct  from  the  awareness  of  that  experience. It  is believed  that  further  refinements  are  possible.\nTo  conclude  our  definition  of  this  construct  in  a  much  more commonsense  way,  I  believe  all  of  us  tend  to  recognize  congruence or  incongruence  in  individuals  with  whom  we  deal. With  some  in­ dividuals  we  realize  that  in  most  areas  this  person  not  only  con­ sciously means exactly what he says,  but that his deepest feelings also match  what  he  is  expressing,  whether  it  is  anger  or  competitiveness or  affection  or  cooperativcncss. We  feel  that  ' we  know  exactly where  he  stands.' With  another  individual  we  recognize  that what he  is  saying  is  almost  certainly  a  front,  a  facade. We wonder what he  really  feels. We wonder if he  knows what  he  feels.  We  tend  to be  wary  and  cautious with  such  an  individual.\nObviously  then  different  individuals  differ  in  their  degree  of  con­ gruence,  and  the  same  individual  differs  at  different moments  in  de­ gree of congruence,  depending  on  what  he is experiencing  and whether  he  can  accept  this  experience  in  his  awareness,  or  must defend  himself  against  it.",

        "text": "Perhaps  the  significance  of  this  concept  for  interpersonal  inter­ action can be recognized  if we make  a  few statements about a  hypo­ thetical  Smith  and  Jones.\n1. Any  communication  of Smith  to  Jones  is  marked  by  some  de­ gree  of  congruence  in  Smith. This  is  obvious  from  the  above.\n2. The greater the congruence of experience, awareness, and com­ munication in Smith,  the  more  it is  likely  that Jones will  experience it  as  a  clear  communication. I  believe  this  has  been  adequately  cov­ ered. If all the cues from  speech,  tone  and gesture  are  unified because  they  spring  from  a  congruence  and  unity  in  Smith,  then there  is  much  less  likelihood  that  these  cues  will  have  an  ambiguous or  unclear  meaning  to  Jones.\n3. Consequently,  the  more  clear  the  communication  from  Smith, the  more  Jones  responds  with  clarity. This  is  simply  saying  that\neven  though  Jones  might  be  quite  mcongruent  in  his  experiencing of  the  topic  under  discussion,  nevertheless  his  response  will  have more clarity and congruence in it than if he had experienced  Smith's communication  as  ambiguous.\n4.  T he  more  that  Smith  is  congruent  in  the  topic  about  which they are  communicating,  the  less  he  has  to  defend  himself against  in this  area, and  the  more  able  he  is  to listen  accurately  to  Jones' response. Putting  it  in  other  terms,  Smith  has  expressed  what  he genuinely  feels. He  is  therefore  more  free  to  listen. The  less  he  is presenting a facade to be defended, the more he can listen accurately to  what  Jones  is  communicating.\n5. But  to  this  degree,  then,  Jones  feels  empathically  understood. He  feels  that  in  so  far  as  he  has  expressed  himself, (and  whether this  is  defensively  or  congruently)  Smith  has  understood  him  pretty much  as  he  sees  himself,  and  as  he  perceives  the  topic  under  con­ sideration.\n6.  For  Jones  to  feel  understood  is  for  him  to  experience  positive regard  for  Smith. To  feel  that  one  is  understood  is  to  feel  that  one has  made  some  kind  of  a  positive  difference  in  the  experience  of another,  in  this  case  of  Smith.\n7. But  to  the  degree  that  Jones (a) experiences  Smith  as  con­ gruent  or  integrated  in  this  relationship; (b) experiences  Smith  as having  positive  regard  for  him;  (c)  experiences  Smith  as  being  em­ pathically  understanding;  to  that  degree  the  conditions  of  a  thera­ peutic  relationship  are  established. I  have  tried  in  another paper  (2) to  describe  the  conditions which  our experience  has led  us  to  believe are  necessary  and  sufficient  for  therapy,  and  will  not  repeat  that description  here.\n8. To  the  extent  that  Jones  is  experiencing  these  characteristics of  a  therapeutic  relationship,  he  finds  himself  experiencing  fewer barriers  to  communication. Hence  he  tends  to  communicate  him­ self more as he is, more congruently.  Little by little his defensiveness decreases.\n9. Having  communicated  himself  more  freely,  with  less  of  de­ fensiveness,  Jones  is  now  more  able  to  listen  accurately,  without  a need  for  defensive distortion, to Smith's  further  communication. This  is  a  repetition  of  step  4,  but  now  in  terms  of  Jones.\n10. To  the  degree  that  Jones  is  able  to  listen,  Smith  now  feels\nempathically understood  (as  in  step  5  for  Jones);  experiences Jones' positive  regard  (a  parallel  to  step  6);  and  finds  himself  experiencing the  relationship  as  therapeutic  (in  a  way  parallel  to  step  7). Thus Smith  and  Jones  have  to  some  degree  become  reciprocally  thera­ peutic  for  each  other.\n11.  This means  that to  some  degree  the process  of therapy occurs in  each  and  that  the  outcomes  of  therapy  will  to  that  same  degree occur  in  each;  change  in  personality  in  the  direction  of  greater unity  and  integration;  less  conflict  and  more  energy  utilizable  for effective living; change  in  behavior in the direction of  greater maturity.\n12.  The  limiting  element  in  this  chain  of  events  appears  to  be  the introduction  of  threatening  material. Thus  if  Jones  in  step 3 in­ cludes  in  his more  congruent response  new  material which is outside of  the realm  of  Smith's  congruence,  touching  an  area  in  which Smith  is  mcongruent,  then  Smith  may  not  be  able  to  listen  accu­ rately, he defends  himself against hearing what Jones is communicat­ ing,  he  responds  with  communication  which  is  ambiguous,  and  the whole  process  described  in  these  steps  begins  to  occur  in  reverse.",

        "text": "Very  tentatively  indeed  I  would  like  to  set  forth  one  further  as­ pect  of  this  whole  matter,  an  aspect  which  is  frequently  very  real in the therapeutic relationship, and also in other relationships, though  perhaps  less  sharply  noted.\nIn the  actual  relationship  both  the  client  and  the  therapist  are frequently faced with the  existential  choice, 'Do I  dare  to communi­ cate  the  full  degree  of  congruence  which  I  feel? Do  I  dare  match my experience, and my awareness of that experience,  with my com­ munication? Do I  dare  to  communicate  myself  as I  am  or  must my communication be somewhat less than or different  from  this?'  The sharpness  of  this  issue  lies  in  the  often  vividly  foreseen  possibility of  threat  or  rejection. To  communicate  one's  full  awareness  of  the relevant  experience  is  a  risk  in  interpersonal  relationships. It  seems to me that it is the taking or not  taking of this risk  which determines whether  a  given  relationship becomes  more  and  more  mutually therapeutic  or  whether  it  leads  in  a  disintegrative  direction.\nTo  put  it  another  way. I cannot  choose  whether  my  awareness will  be  congruent  with  my  experience. This  is  answered  by  my need  for  defense,  and  of  this  I  am  not  aware. But  there  is  a  con­ tinuing  existential  choice  as  to  whether  my  communication  will  be congruent with the awareness I  do  have  of  what I  am  experiencing. In  this  moment-by-moment  choice  in  a  relationship  may  lie  the answer as to whether the movement is in one direction or the other in terms  of  this  hypothesized  law.",

The artist, the writer, the  dancer,  the  musician were all  represented, as  well  as  educators  in  these  various  fields.

        "text": "Many  of  the  serious  criticisms  of  our  culture  and  its  trends  may best  be  formulated  in  terms  of  a  dearth  of  creativity. Let  us  state some  of  these  very  briefly:\nIn  education  we  tend  to  turn  out  conformists,  stereotypes,  in­ dividuals whose education is 'completed,' rather than freely creative and  original  thinkers.\nIn  our  leisure time  activities, passive entertainment and  regimented group  action  are  overwhelmingly  predominant  while  creative  ac­ tivities  are  much less  in  evidence.\nIn  the  sciences,  there  is  an  ample  supply  of  technicians,  but  the number who can creatively formulate fruitful hypotheses and theories is small  indeed.\nIn  industry,  creation  is  reserved  for  the  few - the  manager,  the designer,  the  head of  the  research  department - while  for  the many life  is  devoid  of  original  or  creative  endeavor.\nIn  individual  and  family  life  the  same  picture  holds  true. In  the clothes  we  wear,  the  food  we  eat,  the  books  we  read,  and  the  ideas we  hold,  there  is  a strong  tendency  toward  conformity,  toward stereotypy. To  be  original,  or  different,  is  felt  to  be  ' dangerous.'\nWhy be concerned  over  this? If,  as  a  people,  we  enjoy  conform­ ity  rather  than  creativity,  shall  we  not  be  permitted  this  choice? In my  estimation  such  a choice  would  be  entirely reasonable  were it  not  for  one  great  shadow  which  hangs  over  all  of  us. In  a  time wrhen knowledge, constructive and destructive, is advancing  by the  most  incredible  leaps  and  bounds  into  a  fantastic  atomic  age, genuinely  creative  adaptation  seems  to  represent  the only  possibility that  man  can  keep  abreast  of  the  kaleidoscopic  change  in  his world. With  scientific  discovery  and  invention  proceeding,  we  are  told,  at the  rate  of  geometric  progression,  a  generally  passive  and  culturebound  people  cannot  cope  with  the  multiplying  issues  and  prob­ lems. Unless individuals,  groups,  and  nations  can  imagine,  construct, and creatively revise new ways of relating to  these complex changes, the  lights  will  go  out. Unless man  can  make  new and original  adap­ tations  to  his  environment  as  rapidly  as  his  science  can  change  the environment,  our  culture  will  perish. Not  only  individual  malad­\njustment  and  group  tensions,  but  international  annihilation  will  be the  price  we  pay  for  a  lack  of creativity.\nConsequently it would seem  to  me  that investigations  of the  proc­ ess  of  creativity,  the  conditions  under  which  this  process  occurs, and  the  ways  in  which  it  may  be  facilitated,  are  of  the  utmost  im­ portance.\nIt is  in  the  hope  of  suggesting a  conceptual  structure  under  which such  investigations  might  go  forward,  that  the  following  sections are  offered.",

        "text": "There  are  various  ways  of  defining  creativity. In  order  to  make more  clear the  meaning  of what  is  to  follow,  let me  present the  ele­ ments  which,  for  me,  are  a  part  of  the  creative  proccss,  and  then attempt  a  definition.\nIn  the  first  place, for  me  as  scientist,  there  must  be  something observable,  some  product  of creation. Though my  fantasies may be extremely  novel,  they  cannot  usefully  be  defined  as  creative  unless they  eventuate  in  some  observable  product - unless  they  are  sym­ bolized in  words,  or written  in  a  poem,  or  translated  into  a  work  of art,  or  fashioned  into  an  invention.\nThese  products  must  be  novel  constructions. This  novelty grows out  of  the  unique  qualities  of  the  individual  in  his  interaction  with the  materials  of  experience. Creativity  always  has  the  stamp  of  the individual  upon  its  product,  but  the  product  is  not  the  individual, nor his materials, but partakes of the relationship between the two.\nCreativity  is  not,  in  m y  judgment,  restricted  to  some  particular content. I am  assuming  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in the  creative  process as  it  is  evidenced  in  painting  a  picture,  compos­ ing  a  symphony,  devising  new  instruments  of  killing,  developing a  scientific  theory,  discovering  new  procedures  in  human  relation­ ships, or creating  new formings  of  one's  own  personality  as in psychotherapy. (Indeed  it  is  my  experience  in  this  last  field,  rather than  in  one  of  the  arts,  which  has  given  me  special  interest  in  crea­ tivity  and  its  facilitation. Intimate  knowledge  of  the  way  in  which the  individual  remolds  himself  in  the  therapeutic  relationship,  with\noriginality  and  effective  skill,  gives  one  confidence  in  the  creative potential  of all  individuals.)\nMy  definition,  then,  of  the  creative  process  is  that  it  is  the  emer­ gence  in  action  of  a  novel  relational  product,  growing  out  of  the uniqueness  of  the  individual  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  materials, events,  people,  or  circumstances  of  his  life  on  the  other.\nLet me append some negative footnotes to this definition.  It makes no  distinction  between  ' good'  and  ' bad'  creativity. One man  may be  discovering  a  way  of  relieving  pain,  while  another  is  devising  a new  and  more  subtle  form  of  torture  for  political  prisoners. Both these  actions  seem  to  me  creative, even  though  their  social  value is  very  different. Though I  shall  comment on these  social  valuations later,  I  have  avoided  putting  them  in  my  definition  because  they  are so fluctuating. Galileo and  Copernicus  made  creative  discoveries which in  their  own  day were  evaluated  as  blasphemous and  wicked, and  in  our  day  as  basic  and  constructive. We do not want to  cloud our  definition  with  terms  which  rest  in  subjectivity.\nAnother  way  of  looking  at  this  same  issue  is  to  note  that  to  be regarded  historically  as  representing  creativity,  the  product must  be acceptable to some group at some point of time.  This fact is not help­ ful to  our definition,  however,  both  because of the  fluctuating valua­ tions  already  mentioned,  and  also  because  many  creative  products have  undoubtedly  never been socially  noticed,  but have  disappeared without  ever  having  been  evaluated. So  this  concept  of  group  ac­ ceptance  is  also  omitted  from  our  definition.\nIn  addition,  it  should  be  pointed  out  that  our  definition  makes  no distinction regarding the degree  of creativity, since this too is a value judgment  extremely  variable  in  nature. The  action  of  the  child  in­ venting  a new  game  with  his  playmates;  Einstein formulating  a theory  of  relativity;  the  housewife  devising  a  new  sauce  for  the meat;  a  young  author  writing  his  first  novel;  all  of  these  are,  in terms of our  definition,  creative,  and  there  is  no  attempt to  set them in some  order of more or  less  creative.\nT h e   M otivation  for  C reativity\nThe  mainspring  of  creativity  appears  to  be  the  same  tendency which we discover so  deeply as  the  curative  force  in  psychotherapy\n- vian's  tendency  to  actualize  himself,  to  become  his  potentialities. By  this  I  mean  the  directional  trend  which  is  evident  in  all  organic and  human  life - the  urge  to  expand,  extend,  develop,  mature the  tendency  to  express  and  activate  all  the  capacities  of  the  organ­ ism,  or  the  self. This  tendency  may  become  deeply  buried  under layer  after layer  of  encrusted  psychological defenses;  it  may  be hidden  behind  elaborate  fagades  which  deny  its  existence;  it  is  my belief  however,  based  on  my  experience,  that  it  exists  in  every  in­ dividual,  and  awaits  only  the  proper  conditions  to  be  released  and expressed. It  is  this  tendency  which  is  the  primary  motivation  for creativity  as  the  organism  forms  new  relationships  to  the  environ­ ment in its endeavor most fully to be  itself.\nLet us now attempt to  deal  dircctly  with  this puzzling issue of the social  value  of  a  creative  act. Presumably  few  of  us  are  interested in  facilitating  creativity  which  is  socially  destructive. We  do  not wish, knowingly, to  lend  our efforts to developing individuals whose creative  genius  works  itself  out  in  new  and  better ways  of  robbing, exploiting,  torturing,  killing,  other  individuals;  or  developing  forms of political organization or art forms which  lead humanity into paths of  physical  or  psychological  self-destruction. Yet  how  is  it  possible to  make  the  necessary  discriminations  such  that  we  may  encourage a  constructive  creativity  and  not  a  destructive?\nThe  distinction  cannot  be  made  by  examining  the  product. The very  essence  of  the  creative  is  its  novelty,  and  hence  we  have  no standard  by  which  to  judge  it. Indeed  history  points  up  the  fact that  the  more  original  the  product,  and  the  more  far-reaching  its implications,  the  more  likely  it  is  to  be  judged  by  contemporaries as  evil. The  genuinely  significant  creation,  whether  an  idea,  or  a work  of  art,  or  a  scientific  discovery,  is  most  likely  to  be  seen  at first  as  erroneous,  bad,  or  foolish. Later  it  may  be  seen  as  obvious, something  self-evident to  all. Only  still  later  does  it  receive  its  final evaluation  as  a  creative  contribution. It  seems  clear  that  no  con­ temporary  mortal  can  satisfactorily  evaluate  a  creative  product  at the time  that  it  is  formed,  and  this  statement  is  increasingly  true  the greater  the  novelty  of  the  creation.\nNor  is  it  of  any  help  to  examine  the  purposes  of  the  individual participating  in  the  creative  process. Many,  perhaps  most,  of  the\ncreations  and  discoveries  which  have  proved  to  have  great  social value,  have  been  motivated  by  purposes  having  more  to  do  with personal  interest  than  with  social  value,  while  on  the  other  hand history  records  a  somewhat  sorry  outcome  for  many  of  those  crea­ tions  (various  Utopias,  Prohibition,  etc.)  which  had  as their avowed purpose  the  achievement  of  the  social  good. No,  we  must  face  the fact  that  the  individual  creates  primarily  because  it  is  satisfying  to him,  because  this  behavior  is  felt  to  be  self-actualizing,  and  we  get nowhere  by  trying  to  differentiate  'good'  and  ' bad'  purposes  in the  creative  process.\nMust  we  then  give  over  any  attempt  to  discriminate  between creativity  which  is  potentially  constructive,  and  that  which  is  po­ tentially  destructive? I do  not  believe  this  pessimistic  conclusion  is justified. It is here  that  recent  clinical  findings  from  the  field  of psychotherapy  give  us  hope. It  has  been  found  that  when  the  in­ dividual  is  ' open'  to  all  of  his  experience  (a  phrase  which  will  be defined  more  fully),  then his behavior  will  be creative, and  his creativity  may  be  trusted  to  be  essentially  constructive.\nThe  differentiation  may  be  put  very  briefly  as  follows. To  the extent  that  the  individual  is  denying  to  awareness  (or  repressing,  if you prefer  that term)  large areas  of  his  experience,  then  his  creative formings  may  be  pathological,  or  socially  evil,  or  both. To  the  de­ gree  that  the  individual  is  open  to  all  aspects  of  his  experience,  and has  available  to  his  awareness  all  the  varied  sensings  and  perceivings which  are  going  on  within  his  organism,  then  the  novel  products of his  interaction  with  his  environment  will  tend  to  be  constructive both  for  himself  and  others. To  illustrate,  an  individual  with  para­ noid  tendencies  may  creatively  develop  a  most  novel  theory  of  the relationship  benveen  himself  and  his  environment,  seeing  evidence for  his  theory  in  all  sorts  of  minute  clues. His  theory  has  little  so­ cial  value,  perhaps  because  there  is  an  enormous  range  of  experience which  this  individual  cannot  permit  in  his  awareness. Socrates,  on the other hand, while also regarded as 'crazy' by his contemporaries, developed novel ideas which have  proven to be socially constructive. Very  possibly  this  was  because  he  was  notably  nondefensive  and open  to  his  experience.\nThe  reasoning  behind  this  will  perhaps  become  more  clear  in  the\nremaining sections  of this  paper.  Primarily  however  it is based  upon the discovery in psychotherapy, that as the individual  becomes more open  to,  more  aware  of,  all  aspects  of  his  experience,  he  is  increas­ ingly  likely  to  act  in  a  manner  we  would  term  socialized. If  he  can be  aware  of  his  hostile  impulses,  but  also  of  his  desire  for  friendship and acceptance; aware of the expectations of his  culture,  but equally aware of his own purposes; aware of his selfish desires, but also aware of  his  tender  and  sensitive  concern  for  another;  then  he  behaves  in a  fashion  which  is  harmonious,  integrated,  constructive. The  more he  is  open  to  his  experience,  the  more  his  behavior  makes  it  evident that  the  nature  of  the  human  species  tends  in  the  direction  of  con­ structively  social  living.",

        "text": "What  are  the  conditions  within  the  individual  which  are  most closely  associated  with  a  potentially  constructive  creative  act? I  see these  as  possibilities.\nA. Openness to experience:  Extensionality.  This is the opposite of psychological defensiveness,  when  to  protect the  organization of  the self,  certain  experiences  are  prevented  from  coming  into  awareness except  in  distorted  fashion. In  a  person  who  is  open  to  experience each  stimulus  is  freely  relayed  through  the  nervous  system,  without being distorted by any process of defensiveness. Whether the stimu­ lus  originates  in  the  environment,  in  the  impact  of  form,  color,  or sound  on  the  sensory  nerves,  or  whether  it  originates  in  the  viscera, or  as  a  memory  trace  in  the  central  nervous  system,  it is  available  to awareness. This  means  that  instead  of  perceiving  in  predetermined categories  (' trees  are  green,'  'college  education  is  good,'  ' modem art  is  silly' )  the  individual  is  aware  of  this  existential  moment  as  it is,  thus  being  alive  to  many  experiences  which  fall  outside  the  usual categories  (this  tree  is  lavender;  this  college  education  is  damaging; this  modern  sculpture  has  a  powerful  effect  on  me).\nThis  last  suggests  another  way  o f  describing  openness  to  experi­ ence. It  means  lack  of  rigidity  and  permeability  of  boundaries  in concepts,  beliefs,  perceptions,  and  hypotheses. It  means  a  tolerance for  ambiguity  where  ambiguity  exists. It  means  the  ability  to  re­ ceive  much  conflicting  information  without  forcing  closure  upon\n354\nthe situation.  It means what the  general  semanticist calls the  'extensional  orientation.'\nThis complete openness of awareness to what exists at this moment is, I  believe,  an  important  condition  of  constructive  creativity. In an  equally  intense  but  more narrowly  limited  fashion  it  is  no  doubt present  in  all  creativity. The  deeply  maladjusted  artist  who  cannot recognize or be  aware  of the sources of  unhappiness in  himself, may nevertheless  be  sharply  and  sensitively  aware  of  form  and  color  in his experience. The tyrant  (whether on a petty or grand scale)  who cannot  face  the  weaknesses  in  himself  may  nevertheless  be  com­ pletely  alive  to  and  aware  of  the  chinks  in  the  psychological  armor of  those with  whom  he  deals. Because  there  is  the  openness  to  one phase  of  experience,  creativity  is  possible;  because  the  openness  is only  to  one  phase  of  experience,  the  product  of  this  creativity  may be  potentially  destructive  of  social  values. The  more  the  individual has  available  to  himself  a  sensitive  awareness  of  all  phases  of  his  ex­ perience,  the  more  sure  we  can  be  that  his  creativity  will  be  per­ sonally  and  socially  constructive.\nB.  An  internal  locus of evaluation. Perhaps  the  most fundamental condition of creativity  is that the source or locus of evaluative  judg­ ment is  internal.  The value of his  product is,  for the creative person, established  not  by  the  praise  or  criticism  of  others,  but  by  himself. Have  I  created  something  satisfying  to  me? Does  it  express  a  part of me - my feeling or my thought,  my pain  or  my  ecstasy? These are  the  only  questions  which  really  matter  to  the  creative  person, or  to  any  person  when  he  is  being  creative.\nThis does not mean that he is oblivious to, or unwilling to be aware of,  the  judgments  of  others. It  is  simply  that the  basis  of  evaluation lies  within  himself,  in  his own  organismic  reaction  to and  appraisal of  his  product. If  to  the person  it  has the ' feel'  of being  ' me  in action,'  of  being  an  actualization  of  potentialities  in  himself  which heretofore  have  not  existed  and  are  now  emerging  into  existence, then  it  is satisfying  and creative, and no  outside  evaluation  can change  that  fundamental fact.\nC.  The  ability  to  toy  with  elements  and  concepts. Though  this is  probably  less  important than  A  or B,  it seems to be a  condition of creativity. Associated  with  the  openness  and  lack  of  rigidity  de­\nscribed  under  A  is  the  ability  to  play  spontaneously  with  ideas, colors, shapes, relationships - to juggle elements into impossible juxtapositions,  to shape  wild hypotheses, to make  the  given problem­ atic,  to  express  the  ridiculous,  to  translate  from  one form  to  another, to transform into improbable equivalents.  It is from this spontaneous toying and  exploration  that there  arises  the  hunch,  the  creative  see­ ing  of  life  in  a  new  and  significant  way. It  is  as  though  out  of  the wasteful  spawning  of  thousands  of  possibilities  there  emerges  one or  two  evolutionary  forms  with  the  qualities  which  give  them  a more  permanent  value.",

        "text": "When  these  three  conditions  obtain,  constructive  creativity  will occur. But we cannot expcct an accurate description  of the  creative act,  for  by  its  very  nature  it  is  indescribable. This  is  the  unknown which we must recognize as unknowable until it occurs.  This is the improbable that becomes probable.  Only in  a  very general  way  can we  say  that  a  creative  act  is  the  natural  behavior  of  an  organism which  has  a  tendency  to  arise  when  that  organism  is  open  to  all  of its  inner  and  outer  experiencing,  and  when  it  is  free  to  try  out  in flexible  fashion  all  manner  of  relationships. Out  of  this  multitude of  half-formed  possibilities  the organism,  like  a great  computing machine, selects  this one  which  most  effectively  meets  an  inner need,  or  that  one  which  forms  a  more  effective  relationship  with the  environment,  or  this  other  one  which  discovers  a  more  simple and  satisfying  order  in  which  life  may  be  perceivcd.\nThere  is  one  quality  of  the  creative  act  which  may,  however, be  described. In  almost  all the  products  of creation we  note  a selec­ tivity,  or  emphasis,  an  evidence  of  discipline,  an  attempt  to  bring out  the  essence. The  artist  paints  surfaces  or  textures  in  simplified form,  ignoring  the  minute  variations  which  exist  in  reality. The scientist  formulates  a  basic  law  of  relationships,  brushing  aside  all the particular events or circumstances which might conccal  its naked beauty.  The writer selects those words and  phrases which give unity to his expression. We  may  say  that  this  is  the  influence  of  the specific person,  of the ' I.' Reality exists in a multiplicity of confus­ ing  facts,  but  ' I'  bring  a  structure  to  my  relationship  to  reality;  I\nhave 'my' way of perceiving  reality,  and  it is this  (unconsciously?) disciplined  personal  selectivity  or abstraction which gives to creative products their  esthetic  quality.\nThough this is  as  far as  we  can  go  in  describing any aspect of the creative  act,  there  are  certain  of  its  concomitants  in  the  individual which may be mentioned.  The first is what we  may  call the Eureka feeling - 'This  is it!\" ' I  have  discovered!' ' This  is what I  wanted to  express!'\nAnother  concomitant  is  the  anxiety  of  separateness. I  do  not  be­ lieve  that  many  significantly  creative  products  are  formed  without the  feeling,  ' I  am  alone. No  one  has  ever  done  just  this  before. I have  ventured  into  territory  where  no  one  has  been. Perhaps  I  am foolish,  or wrong,  or  lost,  or  abnormal.'\nStill another  experience  which  usually  accompanies  creativity  is the  desire  to  communicate. It  is  doubtful  whether  a  human  being can  create,  without wishing to  share  his crcation. It is  the  only way he can  assuage  the  anxiety of separateness and  assure  himself that he belongs to the group.  He may confide his theories only to his private diary. He  may  put  his  discoveries  in  some  cryptic  code. He  may conceal  his  poems  in  a  locked  drawer. He  may put away  his  paint­ ings in a  closet. Yet he  desires  to  communicate  with  a  group  which will understand him,  even if he must imagine such a  group.  He does not create  in order to  communicate,  but once  having created  he  de­ sires  to  share  this  new  aspect  of  himself-in-relation-to-his-environment  with  others.",

        "text": "Thus far I  have  tried  to  describe  the  nature  of  creativity,  to  indi­ cate  that  quality  of  individual  experience  which  increases  the  likeli­ hood  that  creativity  will  be  constructive,  to  set  forth  the  necessary conditions  for the creative  act and  to  state some  of  its  concomitants. But if we  are to make progress in meeting the social  need  which  was presented  initially,  we  must  know  whether  constructive  creativity can  be  fostered,  and  if  so,  how.\nFrom  the  very  nature  of  the  inner  conditions  of  creativity  it  is clear  that  they  cannot  be  forced,  but must  be  permitted  to  emerge. The  farmer  cannot  make  the  germ  develop  and  sprout  from  the\nseed;  he  can only supply the  nurturing conditions  which  will  permit the  seed  to  develop  its  own  potentialities. So  it  is  with  creativity. How can we establish  the  external  conditions  which  will  foster  and nourish  the  internal  conditions  described  above? My  experience  in psychotherapy  leads  me  to  believe  that  by  setting  up  conditions  of psychological  safety  and  freedom,  we  maximize  the  likelihood  of an emergence of constructive creativity. Let me spell  out these  con­ ditions  in  some  detail,  labelling  them  as  X   and  Y.\nX.  Psychological safety.  This  may be  established by  three  associ­ ated  processes.\n1. Accepting  the  individual  as  of  unconditional  worth. When­ ever  a  teacher,  parent,  therapist,  or  other  person  with  a  facilitating function  feels  basically  that  this  individual  is  of  worth  in  his  own right and in his own unfolding,  no  matter what his present condition or behavior,  he  is fostering creativity.  This  attitude can  probably  be genuine  only  when  the  teacher,  parent,  etc.,  senses  the  potentialities of  the  individual  and  thus  is  able  to  have  an  unconditional  faith  in him,  no  matter  what  his  present state.\nThe  effect  on  the  individual  as  he  apprehends  this  attitude,  is  to sense  a  climate  of  safety. He  gradually  learns  that  he  can  be  what­ ever  he  is,  without sham  or  fagade,  since  he  seems  to  be  regarded  as of worth no matter what he does. Hence he has less need of rigidity, can  discover  what  it  means  to  be  himself,  can  try  to  actualize  him­ self  in  new  and  spontaneous  ways. He  is,  in  other  words,  moving toward  creativity.\n2. Providing  a  climate in which  external evaluation is absent. When we cease to  form  judgments of the  other  individual  from  our own  locus  of  evaluation,  we  are  fostering  creativity. For  the  in­ dividual  to  find  himself  in  an atmosphere  where  he  is  not  being evaluated,  not  being  measured  by  some  external  standard,  is  enor­ mously  freeing. Evaluation  is  always  a threat,  always  creates  a  need for  defensiveness,  always  means  that  some  portion  of  experience must be denied to awareness.  If this product  is evaluated  as  good  by external  standards,  then  I  must  not  admit  my  own  dislike  of  it. If what  I  am  doing  is  bad  by  external  standards,  then  I  must  not  be aware  of  the  fact  that  it  seems  to  be  me,  to  be  part  of  myself. But if  judgments  based  on  external  standards  are  not  being  made  then\nI  can be more  open to my experience, can recognize  my own likings and  dislikings,  the  nature  of  the  materials  and  of  my  reaction  to them,  more  sharply  and  more  sensitively. I  can  begin  to  recognize the  locus  of  evaluation  within  myself. Hence  I  am  moving  toward creativity.\nTo  allay  some  possible  doubts  and  fears  in  the  reader,  it  should be pointed out that to cease  evaluating another is  not to  cease  having reactions. It  may,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  free  one  to  react. ' I don't like  your  idea' (or  painting,  or  invention,  or  writing),  is  not  an evaluation,  but  a  reaction. It  is  subtly  but  sharply  different  from  a judgment which  says,  'W hat  you  are  doing  is  bad  (or  good),  and this quality is assigned  to  you  from  some external  source.' The  first statement permits the individual  to  maintain his own  locus of evalua­ tion. It  holds  the  possibility  that  I  am  unable  to  appreciate  some­ thing  which  is  actually  very  good. The  second  statement,  whether it praises  or  condemns,  tends to  put the  person  at the  mercy  of out­ side  forces. He  is being  told  that  he  cannot  simply  ask himself whether  this  product  is  a  valid  expression  of  himself;  he  must  be concerned  with  wrhat  others  think. He  is  being  led  away  from creativity.\n3. Understanding  empathically. It is this which provides the ultimate  in  psychological  safety,  when  added  to  the  other  two. If I  say that I  ' accept'  you,  but know  nothing of you, this is a  shallow acceptance  indeed,  and  you  realize  that  it  may  change  if  I  actually come  to  know  you. But  if  I  understand  you  empathically,  see  you and  what  you  are  feeling and  doing  from  your  point of  view,  enter your private  world  and  see  it  as  it  appears  to  you - and  still  accept you - then this is safety indeed.  In this climate you can permit your real self to  emerge,  and  to  express  itself in varied  and  novel  formings as  it  relates  to  the  world. This  is  a  basic  fostering  of  creativity.\nY. Psychological  freedom. When  a  teacher,  parent,  therapist,  or other  facilitating  person  permits  the  individual  a  complete  freedom of  symbolic  expression,  creativity  is  fostered. This  permissiveness gives the  individual  complete  freedom  to  think,  to  feel,  to  be,  what­ ever  is  most  inward  within  himself. It  fosters  the  openness,  and  the playful  and  spontaneous  juggling  of  percepts,  concepts,  and  mean­ ings,  which  is a  part of  creativity.\nNote that  it  is  complete  freedom  of symbolic  expression  which  is described. To  express  in  behavior  all  feelings,  impulses,  and  form­ ings  may  not  in  all instances  be  freeing. Behavior  may  in  some instances  be  limited  by society,  and  this  is  as  it should  be. But sym­ bolic  expression need not be limited.  Thus to  destroy a  hated  object (whether  one's mother  or  a  rococo  building)  by  destroying  a  sym­ bol  of  it,  is  freeing. To  attack  it  in  reality  may  create  guilt  and narrow  the  psychological  freedom  which  is  experienced. (I feel unsure  of  this paragraph,  but  it  is  the  best  formulation  I  can  give  at the  moment  which  seems  to  square  with  my  experience.)\nThe  permissiveness  which  is  being  described  is  not  softness  or indulgence or encouragement.  It is permission  to  be free, which  also means that one  is  responsible. The  individual  is  as  free  to  be  afraid of a new venture as  to be  eager  for  it;  free  to  bear  the  consequences of  his mistakes as well  as  of  his  achievements. It  is  this  type  of  free­ dom  responsibly  to  be  oneself  which  fosters  the  development  of  a secure  locus  of  evaluation  within  oneself,  and  hence  tends  to  bring about the  inner  conditions  of  constructive  creativity.",

        "text": "I feel  a deep  concern that  the  developing  behavioral  sciences may  be  used  to  control  the  individual  and  to  rob  him of  his  personhood. 1 believe,  however,  that  these sciences  might  be  used  to  enhance  the  person.\n20\nThe  Growing Power  of the  Behavioral  Sciences\nL ate  in  1955  Professor  B.  F.  Skinner  of  Harvard  invited  me  to j participate  in  a  friendly  debate  'with  him  at  the  convention  of the American Psychological Association in the fall of 1956.  He knew that we  held very  divergent  views  as to  the  use  of  scientific  knowl­ edge  in  molding  or  controlling  human  behavior,  and  suggested  that a  debate  would  serve  a  useful  purpose  by  clarifying  the  issue. His own  basic  point  of  view  he  had  expressed  by  deploring  the  unwill­ ingness  of  psychologists  to  use  their  power. ' At  the  moment  psy­ chologists  are curiously diffident in assuming  control  where  it  is available  or  in  developing  it  where  it  is  not. In  most  clinics  the emphasis  is  still  upon  psychometry,  and  this  is  in  part  due  to  an unwillingness  to  assume  the  responsibility  of  control.  . . .   In  some curious way  we feel compelled to  leave  the active  control of human behavior  to  those  who  grasp  it  for  selfish  purposes\n1  was in agreement with  him  that  such  a  discussion  would  serve  a valuable purpose  in  stirring  interest  in  an  important  issue. We  held the  debate  in  September  1956. It attracted  a  large  and  attentive audience, and, as is the way  in  debates, most  of  the ?nembers  doubt­ less  left  feeling  confirmed  in  the  views  they  held  when  they  came · Skinner, B.  F.,  in Current  Trends in  Psychology, edited  by  Wayne  Dennis (University  of  Pittsburgh  Press,  1947),  pp.  24-25.\n363\n364 T he  B f.ham oral  S c ien c es  and  th e  P erson in. The text  of  the  debate  was  published  in  Scicnce,  N ov.  30,  1956, 124,  pp.  1051-1066.\nAs 1 milled over this experience afterward, my  only  dissatisfaction 1 lay  in  the  fact  that  it  was  a  debate. While  both  Skinner  and  1  had endeavored  to  avoid  argument  for  argument's  sake,  the  tone  was nevertheless  of an  either-or  variety. I  felt  that  the  question  was  far too important to be thought of as an argument  between two persons, or  a  simple  black  versus  white  issue. So  during  the  following  year I wrote out at greater length, and with, I  believe,  less argumentative­ ness, my  own perception  of the  elements  in  this  problem  which  one day  will  be  seen  as  a  profoundly  momentous  decision  for  society. The  exposition  seemed  to  fall  naturally  into  two  parts,  and  these constitute  the  two  chapters  which  follow.\nI  had  no  particular  plan  in  mind  for  the  use  of  these  documents when 1 wrote them.  1 have  however  used  them  as  the  basis  for  lec­ tures  to  the  course  on  ' Contemporary  Trends'  at  the  University  of Wisconsin,  and  this  past  year  /  used  them  as  the  basis  for  a  seminar presentation  to  faculty  and  students  at  the  California  Institute  of T   echnology.\n%\nT he  sc ie n c e s which  deal  w ith   behavior  are  in  an  infant  state. This  eluster  of  scicntific  disciplines  is  usually  thought  of  as  in­ cluding  psychology,  psychiatry,  sociology,  social  psychology,  an­ thropology, and  biology,  though  sometimes  the  other social  sciences such as economics and political scicnce arc included, and mathematics and  statistics  are very  much  involved  as  instrumental disciplines. Though  they  are  all  at  work  trying  to  understand  the  behavior  of man  and  animals,  and  though  research  in  these  fields  is  growing  by leaps  and  bounds,  it  is  still  an  area  in  which  there  is  undoubtedly more confusion  than solid  knowledge.  Thoughtful  workers  in  these fields  tend  to  stress  the  enormity  of  our scicntific  ignorance  regard­ ing  behavior,  and  the  paucity  of  general  laws  which  have  been  dis­ covered. They  tend  to  compare  the  state  of  this  field  of  scientific\nendeavor  with  that  of  physics,  and  seeing  the  relative  precision  of measurement, accuracy of prediction, and  elegance and simplicity of the  discovered  lawfulness  in  this  latter  field,  are  vividly  aware  of the  newness,  the  infancy,  the  immaturity,  of  the  behavioral  science field.\nWithout  in  any  way  denying  the  truthfulness  of  this  picture,  I believe it is  sometimes  stressed  to  the  point  where  the  general  public may fail  to  recognize  the  other side  of the  coin. Behavioral science, even though in its infancy,  has made mighty strides toward becoming an  ' if -  then'  science. By  this  I mean  that  it  has  made  striking progress in  discerning and  discovering  lawful  relationships such  that if  certain  conditions  exist,  then  certain  behaviors  will  predictably follow. I believe  that  too  few  people  are  aware  of  the  extent,  the breadth,  and  the  depth  of  the  advances  which  have  been  made  in rccent  decades  in  the  behavioral  sciences. Still fewer  seem  to  be aware of the profound social, educational, political, economic, ethical,  and  philosophical  problems  posed  by  these  advances.\nI would  like  in this and  the  subsequent  lecture  to  accomplish several  purposes. First,  I  would  like  to  sketch,  in  an  impressionistic manner,  a  picture  of  the  growing  ability  of  the  behavioral  sciences to  understand,  predict,  and  control  behavior. Then  I  should  like  to point  out  the  serious  questions  and  problems  which  such  achieve­ ments pose for  us as  individuals and as  a  society. Then  I  should  like to  suggest  a  tentative  resolution  of  these  problems  which  has  mean­ ing  for  me.",

        "text": "With  these  selective  factors  and  qualifications  in  mind  let  us  first look at some of the achievements in  the behavioral sciences in which the element of prediction is prominent.  The pattern of each of these can be generalized  as follows:  ' If  an  individual  possesses measurable characteristics  a,  b,  and  c  then  we  can  predict  that  there  is  a  high probability  that  he  will  exhibit  behaviors x,  y,  and  2.'\nThus, we know how to predict, with considerable accuracy, which individuals  will  be  successful  college  students,  successful  industrial executives, successful  insurance salesmen, and  the like. I  will  not  at­ tempt  to  document  this  statement,  simply  because  the  documenta­ tion  would  be  so  extensive. The  whole  field  of  aptitude  testing,  of vocational  testing,  of  personnel  selection  is  involved. Although  the specialists  in  these  fields  are  rightly  concerned  with  the  degree  of inaccuracy  in  their predictions,  the  fact  remains  that  here  is  a  wide area  in  which  the  work  of  the  behavioral  sciences  is  accepted  by multitudes of  hardheaded  industries,  universities  and  other  organiza­ tions. We  have  come  to  accept  the  fact  that  out  of  an  unknown group  the  behavioral  scientist  can  select  (with  a  certain  margin  of error)  those persons who will be successful typists,  practice  teachers, filing  clerks,  or  physicists.\nThis  field  is  continually  expanding. Efforts  are  being  made  to determine  the  characteristics  of  the  creative  chemist,  for  example, as  over  against  the  merely  successful  chemist,  and,  though  without outstanding success,  efforts  have  been  and  are  being  made  to  deter­ mine  the  characteristics  which  will  identify  the  potentially  success­ ful  psychiatrist and  clinical psychologist. Science  is  moving steadily forward in  its  ability  to  say whether  or  not you  possess  the  measur­ able characteristics which are  associated  with a certain type  of occu­ pational  activity.\nWe  know  how  to  predict  success  in  schools  for  military  officer candidates, and in  combat  performance.  T o  select one  study  in  this field,  Williams  and  Leavitt  (31)  found  that  they  could  make  satis­ factory  predictions  regarding  a  Marine's  probable  success  in  OCS and  in later combat  performance  by  obtaining  ratings  from  his ' buddies.' They  also  found  that  in  this  instance  the  man's  fellow soldiers  were  better  psychological  instruments  than  were  the  ob­ jective  tests  they  used. There  is  illustrated  here  not  only  the  use  of certain  measures  to  predict  behavior,  but  a  willingness  to  use  those measures,  whether  conventional  or  unconventional,  which  are  dem­ onstrated  to  have  predictive  power.\nWe  can  predict  how  radical  or  conservative  a  potential  business executive  will  be. Whyte  (30),  in  his  recent  book  cites  this  as  one of  many  examples  of  tests  that  are  in  regular  use  in  industrial  cor­ porations. Thus  in  a  group  of  young  executives  up  for  promotion, top  management can  select those  who  will  exhibit  (within  a  margin of error)  whatever degree of conservatism or  radicalism is calculated to  be  for  the  best welfare  of the  company.  They  can  also  base  their selection  on  knowledge  of  the  degree  to  which each  man  has  a latent  hostility  to society, or latent  homosexuality, or psychotic tendencies. Tests  giving  (or  purporting  to  give)  such  measures  are in use by many corporations both for screening purposes in selection of  new  management  personnel,  and  also  for  purposes  of  evaluation of  men  already  in  management  positions,  in  order  to  choose  those who  will  be  given  greater  responsibilities.\nWe know how to predict which members of an  organization will be  troublemakers  and!or  delinquent. A  promising young  psycholo­ gist (10) has  devised  a  short,  simple  pencil  and  paper  test  which\n368\nhas  shown  a  high  degree  of  accuracy  in  predicting  which  of  the employees  hired  by  a  department  store  will  be  unreliable,  dishonest, or  otherwise  difficult. He  states  that  it  is  quite  possible  to  identify, with  considerable  precision,  the  potential  troublemakers  in  any  or­ ganized  group.  This ability  to  identify those who  will make  trouble is, so  far  as  the  technical  issues  are  concerned,  simply  an  extension of  the  knowledge  we  have  of  prediction  in  other  fields. From  the scicntific  point  of  view  it  is  no  different  from  predicting  who  will be a  good  typesetter.\nWe know that a  competent  clerical  worker,  using  a  combination of test scores and actuarial tables, can give a better predictive picture of a person's personality  and behavior, than can an experienced  clini­ cian. Paul  Meehl  (18)  has  shown  that  we  are  sufficiently  advanced in our development of personality tests,  and  in  information  accumu­ lated  through  these  tests,  that  intuitive  skill  and  broad  knowledge, experience, and training, are quite  unnecessary in producing accurate personality  descriptions. He  has  shown  that  in  many  situations  in which personality diagnoses are being made - mental hygiene clinics, veteran's  hospitals,  psychiatric  hospitals,  and the  like,  it  is wasteful  to  use  well-trained  professional  personnel  to  make  person­ ality  diagnoses  through  the  giving  of  tests,  interviewing  the  person and  the  like. He  has  shown  that  a  clerk  can  do  it  better,  with  only a  minimum and impersonal contact with  the  patient.  First a  number of  tests  would  be  administered and  scored. Then  the  profile  of scores  would  be  looked  up  in  actuarial  tables  prepared  on  the  basis of  hundreds  of  cases,  and  an  accurate  and  predictive  description  of personality would emerge,  the  clerk simply copying down the  com­ bination  of  characteristics  which  had  been  found  to  be  statistically correlated with  this configuration  of scores.\nAleehl  is here simply carrying forward  to  the  next  logical  step  the current  development  of  psychological  instruments  for  the  measure­ ment,  appraisal  and  evaluation of  human  characteristics,  and  the pre­ diction  of  certain  behavior  patterns  on  the  basis  of  those  measure­ ments. Indeed,  there  is  no  reason  why  Aleehl's  clerk  could  not  also be  eliminated. With  proper  coded  instructions  there  is  no  reason why  an  electronic  computer  could  not  score  the  tests,  analyze  the profiles  and  come  up  with  an  even  more  accurate  picture  of  the person  and  his  predicted  behavior  than  a  human  clerk.\nGrowing  Power  of  the  Behavioral  Sciences\nWe  can  select  those  persons  r who  are  easily  persuaded,  who  will conform  to  group  pressures,  or  those  who  will  not  yield. Two separate  but  compatible  studies  (15,  16)  show  that  individuals  who exhibit  certain  dependency  themes  in  their  responses  to  the  pictures of  the  Thematic  Apperception  Test,  or  who,  on  another  test,  show evidence  of  feelings  of  social  inadequacy,  inhibition  of  aggression, and  depressive  tendencies,  will  be  easily  persuaded,  or  will  yield  to group pressures.  These small  studies  are  by  no  means  definitive,  but there is every  reason  to  suppose  that  their basic  hypothesis  is correct and that these  or other more  refined  measures will accurately predict which  members of a  group  will  be  easily  persuaded,  and  which  will be  unyielding  even  to  fairly  strong  group  pressures.\nWe can predict, from the way  individuals  perceive  the movement of a spot of light in a dark room, whether they  tend to  he prejudiced or unprejudiced.  There  has  been  much  study  of  ethnocentrism,  the tendency toward  a  pervasive  and  rigid  distinction  between  ingroups and  outgroups,  with  hostility  toward  outgroups,  and  a  submissive attitude  toward,  and  belief  in  the  rightness of,  ingroups. One of the theories  which  has  developed  is  that  the  more  ethnocentric  person is unable to tolerate  ambiguity or uncertainty in  a  situation. Operat­ ing  on  this  theory  Block  and  Block  (5)  had  subjects  report  on  the degree  of movement they perceived  in  a  dim  spot of  light  in  a  com­ pletely  dark  room. (Actually  no  movement  occurs,  but  almost  all individuals  perceive  movement  in  this  situation.) They  also  gave these  same  subjects  a  test  of  ethnocentrism. It  was  found,  as  pre­ dicted, that those who, in successive trials, quickly established a norm for  the  amount  of  movement  they  perceived,  tended  to  be  more ethnocentric  than  those  whose  estimates  of  movement  continued  to show  variety.\nThis  study  was  repeated,  with  slight  variation,  in  Australia  (28), and  the  findings  were  confirmed  and  enlarged, ft  was  found  that the  more  ethnocentric  individuals  were  less  able  to tolerate am­ biguity,  and  saw  less  movement  than  the  unprejudiced. They  also were  more  dependent  on  others  and  when  making  their  estimates in  the  company  of  another  person,  tended  to  conform  to  the  judg­ ment  of  that  person.\nHence  it  is  not  too  much  to  say  that  by  studying  the  way  the individual  perceives the  movement of a dim  light in a  dark  room,  we\nT he  B ehavioral  S cien ces  and  the  P erson\ncan  tell  a  good  deal  about  the  degree  to  which  he  is  a  rigid,  preju­ diced,  ethnocentric  person.\nThis  hodgepodge  of  illustrations  of  the  ability  of  the  behavioral scicnces to predict behavior, and  hence to select individuals  who  will exhibit certain  behaviors,  may  be  seen  simply  as  the  burgeoning  ap­ plications  of  a  growing  field  of science. But what  these  illustrations suggest  can  also  cause  a  cold  chill  of  apprehension. The  thoughtful person  cannot  help  but  recognize  that  these  developments  I  have described  are  but the  beginning. He cannot fail  to  see  that  if  more highly  developed  tools were in  the hands  of  an  individual  or  group, together  with  the  power  to  use  them,  the  social  and  philosophical implications are  awesome. He  can  begin  to  see  why  a  scientist  like von  Bertalanffy warns,  'Besides  the  menace  of  physical  technology, the  dangers of psychological technology  are  often  overlooked'  (3).",

        "text": "But  before  we  dwell  on  this  social  problem,  let  us  move  on  to another  area  of  the  behavioral  sciences,  and  again  take  a  sampling of  illustrative  studies. This  time  let  us  look  at  some  of  the  research which  shows  potentiality  for  control  of  groups. In  this  realm  we are  interested  in  investigations  whose  findings  are  of  this  pattern: ' 7f  conditions  a,  b,  and  c  exist  or  are  established  in  a  group,  then there  is  a  high  probability  that  these  conditions  will  be  followed  by behaviors x, y, and z.'\nWe  know  how  to  provide  conditions  in  a  work  group,  whether in  industry  or  in  education,  which  will  be  followed  by increased productivity,  originality,  and  morale. Studies  by  Coch  and  French (7),  by Nagle  (19),  and by Katz,  Macoby,  and  Morse  (17)  show  in general that when workers in industry participate  in  planning and  in decisions,  when  supervisors  are  sensitive  to  worker  attitudes,  and when supervision  is  not  suspicious  or  authoritarian,  production  and morale increase.  Conversely we know how to provide the conditions which  lead  to  low  productivity  and  low  morale,  since  the  reverse conditions produce  a  reverse  effect.\nWe know how  to  establish,  i?i  any  group,  the  conditions  of  lead­ ership  which  will  be  followed  by  personality  development  in  the members of the group, as well as by increased productivity  and origi-\njlity, and improved gi oup spirit. In  groups as diverse as a brief uni­ versity  workshop  and  an  industrial  plant  making  castings,  Gordon (9)  and  Richard  (22)  have  shown  that  where  the  leader  or  leaders hold  attitudes  customarily  thought  of  as  therapeutic,  the  results  are good.  In other  words if the  leader  is  acceptant,  both  of  the  feelings of group  members and  of  his  own  feelings;  if he  is  understanding  of others  in  a  sensitively  empathic  way;  if  he  permits  and  encourages free discussion; if he places responsibility  with the group;  then there is evidence of personality growth in the members of the  group, and the group functions more effectively, with greater creativity and better  spirit.\nWe  know  how  to  establish  conditions  which  will  result  in  in­ creased  psychological  rigidity  in  members  of  a  group. Beier  (2), in  a  careful  study,  took  two  matched  groups  of  students  and  meas­ ured several  aspects  of  their abilities,  particularly  abstract  reasoning. Each  of  the  students  in  one  group  was  then  given  an  analysis  of  his personality  based  upon the Rorschach  test. Following  this  both groups  were  re-tested  as  to  their  abilities. The  group  which  had been  given  an  evaluation  of  their  personalities  showed  a  decrease  in flexibility,  and  a  significant  decrease  in  ability  to  carry  on  abstract reasoning. They  became  more  rigid,  anxious,  and  disorganized  in their  thinking,  in  contrast  to  the  control  group.\nIt  w'ould  be  tempting  to  note  that  this  evaluation - experienced by  the group  as  somewhat  threatening - seems very similar to many  evaluations  made  in  our  schools  and  universities  under  the guise  of  education. All  we  are  concerned  with  at  the  moment  is that  we  do  know  how  to  establish  the  conditions  which  make  for less  effective  functioning  on  complex  intellectual  tasks.\nWe  know  a  great  deal  about  how  to  establish  conditions  which will  influence  consumer  responses  and/or  public  opinion. I think this  need  not  be  documented  with  research  studies. I  refer  you  to the advertisements in  any  magazine, to the  beguilements  of  T V   pro­ grams  and  their Trendex  ratings,  to  the  firms  of public  relations  ex­ perts,  and  to  the  upward  trend  o f  sales  by  any  corporation  which puts  on  a  well-planned  series  of  ads.\nWe know how to influence the buying behavior of individuals  by setting up  conditions which  provide  satisfaction  for  needs  of  which\nthey  aic  unconscious,  but  'which  we  have  been  able  to  determine. It  has  been  shown  that some  women  who  do  not  buy  instant coffee because  of  'a  dislike  for  its  flavor'  actually  dislike  it  at  a  subcon­ scious  level  because  it  is  associated  with  being  a  poor  housekeeper - with  laziness  and  spendthrift  qualities  (11). This  type  of  study, based  on  the  use  of  projective  techniques  and  ' depth'  interviews, has  led  to  sales  campaigns  built  upon  appeals  to  the  unconscious motives  of  the  individual -  his  unknown  sexual,  aggressive,  or  de­ pendent desires,  or as in  this instance,  the  desire  for  approval.\nThese illustrative studies indicate something of our potential ability  to  influence  or  control  the  behavior  of  groups. If  we  have the  power  or  authority  to  establish  the necessary  conditions,  the predicted  behaviors  will  follow. There  is  no  doubt  that  both  the studies  and  the  methods  are,  at  the  present  time  crude,  but  more refined  ones  are  sure  to  develop.\nC onditions  W hich  Produce  S pecified   E ffec ts  in  Individuals\nPerhaps  even  more  impressive  than  our  knowledge  of  groups  is the  knowledge  which  is  accumulating  in  the  behavioral  sciences  as to  the  conditions  which  will  be  followed  by  specified  types  of  be­ havior  in  the  individual. It  is  the  possibility  of  scientific  prediction and  control  of individual behavior  which  comes  closest to  the  inter­ ests of each one of us.  Again  let us  look  at scattered bits  of this type of  knowledge.\nWe  know  how  to  set 7 tp  the  conditions  under  which  many  in­ dividuals  will  report  as  true,  judgments  which  are  contrary  to  the evidence  of  their  senses. They  will,  for  example  report  that  Figure A  covers  a  larger  area  than  Figure  B,  when  the  evidence  of  their senses plainly  indicates that the  reverse  is true. Experiments bv  Asch (1)  later  refined  and  improved  by  Crutchfield  (8)  show  that  w^hcn a  person  is  led  to  believe  that  everyone  else  in  the  group  sees  A  as larger  than  B,  then  he  has  a  strong  tendency  to  go  along  with  this judgment,  and  in  many  instances  does  so  with  a  real  belief  in  his false report.\nNot  only  can  we  predict  that  a  certain  prccentage  of  individuals will  thus  yield,  and  disbelieve  their  own  senses,  but  Crutchfield  lias determined  the  personality  attributes  of  those  who  will  do  so,  and\nby selection procedures would be able to  choose a group who would almost  uniformly  give  in  to  these  pressures  for  conformity.\nWe know how to change the opinions of tin individual in a selected direction,  without  his  ever  becoming  aware  of  the  stimuli  which changed  his  opinion. A  static,  expressionless  portrait  of  a  man  was flashed  on  a  screen  by  Smith,  Spence  and  Klein (27). They  re­ quested  their  subjects  to  note  how  the  expression  of  the  picture changed. Then  they  intermittently  flashed  the  word  'angry'  on the  screen,  at  exposures  so  brief  that  the  subjects  were  consciously completely  unaware  of  having  seen  the  word. They  tended,  how­ ever,  to  sec the  face  as  becoming  more  angry. When  the  word ' happy'  was  flashed  on  the  screen  in  similar  fashion,  the  viewers tended  to  see  the  face  as  becoming  more  happy. Thus  they  were clearly  influenced  by  stimuli  which  registered  at  a  subliminal  level, stimuli  of  which  the  individual  was  not,  and  could  not  be,  aware.\nWe  know  how  to  influence  psychological  moodsy   attitudes,  and behaviors,  through  drugs. For  this  illustration  we  step  over  into the rapidly developing borderline area between chemistry and psychology.  From  drugs  to  keep  awake  while  driving  or  studying, to  so-called  ' truth serum'  which  reduces  the  psychological  defenses of the  individual,  to  the  chemotherapy  now  practiced  in  psychiatric wards,  the  range  and  complexity  of  the  growing  knowledge  in  this field  is  striking. Increasingly  there  are  efforts  to  find  drugs  with more  specific  effects - a  drug  which  will  energize  the  depressive individual,  another  to  calm  the  excited,  and  the  like. Drugs  have reportedly  been  given  to  soldiers  before  a  battle  to  eliminate  fear. Trade  names  for  the  tranquili/.ing  drugs  such  as  Miltown  have  al­ ready crept into our language, even into our  cartoons. While much  is  still  unknown  in  this  field,  Dr.  Skinner  of  Harvard  states that,  ' In  the  not-too-distant  future,  the  motivational  and  emotional conditions of  normal  life  will  probably  be  maintained  in  any  desired state  through  the  use  of  drugs' (26). While  this  seems  to be  a somewhat  exaggerated  view,  his  prediction  could  be  partially  justi­ fied.\nWe  know  how  to  provide  psychological  conditions  which  will produce  vivid  hallucinations  and  other  abnormal  reactions  in  the thoroughly  normal  individual  in  the  waking  state. T his  knowledge\n374\ncame  about  as  the  unexpected  by-product  of  research  at  AIcGill University  (4). It  was  discovered  that  if  all channels  of  sensory stimulation  are  cut  off  or  muffled,  abnormal  reactions  follow. If healthy  subjects  lie  motionless,  to  reduce  kinaesthctic  stimuli,  with eyes  shielded  by  translucent  goggles  which  do  not  permit  percep­ tion,  with  hearing  largely  stifled  by  foam  rubber  pillows  as  well  as by  being  in  a  quiet  cubicle,  and  with  tactile  sensations  reduccd  by cuffs over the hands,  then  hallucinations and bizarre  ideation  bearing some  resemblance  to  that  of  the  psychotic  occur  within  forty-eight hours  in  most  subjects. What  the  results  would  be  if  the  sensory stifling  were  continued  longer  is  not  known  because  the  experience seemed so potentially dangerous that the  investigators were  reluctant to  continue  it.\nWe  know  how  to  use  a  person's  own  words  to  open  tip  whole troubled  areas  in  his  experience. Cameron  (6) and  his  associates have taken from recorded therapeutic interviews with a patient, brief statements  by  the  patient  which  seem  significantly  related  to  the underlying  dynamics of the case. Such a  brief statement is  then  put on  a  continuous tape  so  that it can  be  played  over  and  over. When the  patient  hears  his own  significant words repeated  again and  again, the effect is very potent.  By  the time  it  has been  repeated  twenty or thirty  times the  patient often begs  to  have  it stopped. It  seems  clear that  it  penetrates  the  individual's  defenses,  and  opens  up  the  whole psychic  area  related  to  the  statement. For  example,  a  woman  who feels  very  inadequate  and  is  having  marital  difficulties,  talked  about her  mother  in  one  interview,  saying  of  her,  among  other  things, 'That's  what  I  can't  understand - that  one  could  strike  at  a  little child.' This  recorded  sentence  was  played  over  and  over  to  her. It  made  her  very  uneasy  and  frightened. It  also  opened  up  to  her all  her  feelings  about  her  mother. It helped  her  to  see  that  ' not being able to  trust  my mother not  to  hurt me  has  made  me mistrust­ ful  of  everybody.'  This is a  very  simple  example  of  the  potency  of the  method,  which  can  not  only  be  helpful  but  which  can  be  dan­ gerously  disorganizing  if  it  penetrates  the  defenses  too deeply  or too  rapidly.\nWe  know  the  attitudes  which,  if  provided  by  a  counselor  or  a therapist,  will  be  predictably  followed  by  certain  constructive  per­\nsonality  and  behavior  changes  in  the  client. Studies  we  have  com­ pleted  in  recent years  in  the  field  of  psychotherapy  (23,  24,  25,  29) justify  this  statement. The findings  from  these  studies  may  be  very briefly summarized  in  the  following way.\nIf the  therapist provides  a  relationship  in  which  he  is  (a)  genuine, internally  consistent; (b)  acceptant,  prizing  the  client  as  a  person of  worth; (c) empathically  understanding  of  the  client's  private world  of  feelings  and  attitudes;  then  certain  changes  occur  in  the client.  Some of  these changes are;  the  client becomes  (a)  more  real­ istic  in  his  self-perceptions; (b)  more  confident  and  self-directing; (c)  more  positively  valued  by  himself;  (d)  less  likely  to  repress  ele­ ments  of  his  experience;  (c) more  mature,  socialized  and  adaptive in  his  behavior;  (f)  less  upset by  stress  and  quicker  to  recover  from it; (g) more  like  the  healthy, integrated,  well-functioning  person in his personality structure.  These  changes do  not occur in  a control group,  and  appear  to  be  definitely  associated  with  the  client's  being in  a  therapeutic  relationship.\nWe  know  how  to  disintegrate  a  marts  personality  structure,  dis­ solving his self-confidence,  destroying the  concept  he  has of himself, and  making  him  dependent  on  another.  A  very  careful  study  by Hinkle  and  W olff  (13)  of  methods  of  Communist  interrogation  of prisoners,  particularly  in  Communist  China,  has  given  us  a  reason­ ably accurate picture of the process  popularly known as 'brainwash­ ing.' Their  study  has  shown  that  no  magical  nor  essentially  new methods  have  been  used,  but mostly  a  combination  of  practices  de­ veloped  by  rule  of  thumb. What is  involved  is  largely  a  somewhat horrifying reversal of the conditions  of psychotherapy  briefly noted above. If  the  individual  under  suspicion  is  rejected  and  isolated  for a  long time, then  his need  for a  human relationship is  greatly  intensi­ fied. The  interrogator  exploits  this  by  building  a  relationship  in which he shows mostly non-acceptance, and does all he can to arouse guilt, conflict and anxiety.  He is acceptant  toward  the prisoner only when  the  prisoner  'cooperates'  by  being  willing  to  view  events through  the  interrogator's  eyes. He  is  completely  rejecting  of  the prisoner's  internal frame  of  reference,  or personal perception  of events.  Gradually,  out of his  need for more  acceptance,  the prisoner comes  to  accept  halftruths  as  being  true,  until  little  by  little  he  has\ngiven  up  his  own  view  of  himself  and  of  his  behavior,  and  has  acccpted  the viewpoint of  his interrogator. He is  very  much  demoral­ ized  and  disintegrated  as  a  person,  and  largely  the  puppet  of  the  in­ terrogator.  He is then willing to  ' confess' that he is an enemy of the state, and  has committed all kinds of treasonable acts which either he has  not  done,  or  which  actually  had  a  very  different  significance.\nIn  a  sense  it  is  misleading  to  describe  these  methods  as  a  product of the  behavioral sciences.  They  were  developed  by the  Russian and Chinese police,  not  by  scientists. Yet I  include  them  here  since  it  is very  clear  that  these  crude  methods  could  be  made  decidedly  more effective  by  means  of  scientific  knowledge  which  we  now  possess. In  short  our  knowledge  of  how  personality  and  behavior  may  be changed  can  be  used  constructively  or  destructively,  to  build  or  to destroy persons.",

        "text": "Perhaps I  have  already given ample  evidence  of the significant and often  frightening  power  of  this  young  field  of  science. Yet  before we turn to the implications of all this, I  should like to push  the matter one  step  further  by  mentioning  a  few  small  bits  of  the  very  large amount  of  knowledge  which  has  accumulated  in  regard  to  the  be­ havior of animals. Here my own  acquaintance  is  even  more  limited, but I  would  like  to  mention  three  suggestive  studies  and  their  find­ ings.\nWe know how to  establish  the  conditions  which will cause young ducklings  to  develop  a  lasting devotion  to,  for  example, an  old shoe. Hess  (12)  has  carricd  out  studies  of  the  phenomenon  of  'imprint­ ing,'  first investigated  in  Europe. He  has  shown  that  in  mallard ducklings,  for  example,  there  are  a  few  crucial  hours - from  the 13th  to  the  17th  hour  after  hatching - when  the  duckling  becomes attached to any object to  which it may be exposed.  The more effort it exerts in following this object,  the more intense  will  be the  attach­ ment.  Normally of course this results in an attachment to the mother duck,  but  the  duckling  can  just  as  easily  form  an  indelible  devotion to  any  goal  object - to  a  decoy  duck,  to  a  human  being,  or,  as  I have mentioned, to an old shoe. Is  there  any  similar  tendency  in  the human infant?  One cannot help but speculate.\nWe know how to eliminate a strong specific fear in a rat by  means of  clectro-convnlsive  shock. Hunt  and Brady (14) first trained thirsty rats to  obtain  water by  pressing a  lever. This they did  freely and  frequently  while  in  the  experimental  box. When  this  habit was well  fixed  a  conditioned  fear  was  established  by  having  a  clicker sound for a  time before a  mildly  painful  electric  shock  was  adminis­ tered.  After a time the rats responded with strong fear reactions and cessation  of  all  lever  pressing  whenever  the  clicker  sounded,  even though the  clicking was  not  followed  bv  any painful  stimulus.  This conditioned  fear reaction was however almost completely eliminated by  a  series  of  electo-convulsive  shocks  administered  to  the  animals. Following  this  scries  of  shock  treatments  the  animals  showed  no fear,  and  freely  pressed  the  lever,  even  while  the  clicker was  sound­ ing.  The  authors interpret their results very  cautiously,  but the  gen­ eral  similarity to shock  therapy  administered  to  human  beings  is obvious.\nWe know how to train pigeons so that they  can direct an explosive missile to  a pre-determined  target. Skinner's  amusing  account  (26a) of  this  wartime  development  is  only  one  of  many  impressive  in­ stances of the possibilities of so-called operant conditioning.  He  took pigeons and 'shaped up'  their peeking behavior by  rewarding  them whenever they came at all  close to  pecking in  the  direction  of,  or at, an object he  had  preselected.  Thus he  could  take  a  map of a  foreign city,  and  gradually  train  pigeons  to  peck  only  at  that  portion  which contained  some  vital  industry - an  airplane  factory,  for  instance. Or  he  could  train  them  to  peck  only  at  representations  of  certain types  of  ship  at  sea. It  was  then  only  a  technical  matter,  though  to be  sure  a  complex  one,  to  turn  their  pcckings  into  guidance  for  a missile. Housing  two  or  three  pigeons  in  the  simulated  nose  of  a missile  he  was  able  to  show  that  no  matter  how  it  might  veer  off course the pigeons would bring it back  'on target'  by  their pecking.\nIn  response  to  what  I  am  sure  must  be  your  question,  I  must  say that,  N o,  it  was  never  used  in  warfare,  because  of  the  unexpectedly rapid  development  of  electronic  devices. But  that  it  would have worked, there seems little question.\nSkinner  has  been  able  to  train  pigeons  to  play  ping  pong,  for example, and  he and  his co-workers  have  been  able  to  develop  many\ncomplex  behaviors  in  animals  which  seem  'intelligent'  and  'pur­ poseful.' The  principle  is  the  same  in  all  instances. The  animal  is given  positive  reinforcement - some  small  reward - for  every  be­ havior which is at all  in the  direction  of the  purpose  selected  by  the investigator. At  first  perhaps  it  is  only  very  gross  behaviors  which in  a  general  way  are  in  the  desired  direction. But  more  and  more the  behavior  is  'shaped  up'  to  a  refined,  exact,  specific  set  of  pre­ selected actions.  From the vast behavioral repertoire  of an organism, those  behaviors  are  reinforced  with  increasing  refinement,  which serve the exact purpose of the investigator.\nExperiments with human beings are a little less  clearcut, but it  has been shown that by such operant conditioning  (such as a  nod of the head  by  the  investigator)  one  can  bring  about  an  increase  in  the number of plural nouns, or statements  of personal  opinion,  expressed by  the  subject,  without  his  having  any  awareness  of  the  reason  for this change in  his  behavior. In  Skinner's  view  much  of  our behavior is  the  result  of  such  operant  conditioning,  often  unconscious  on  the part  of  both  participants. He  would  like  to  make  it  conscious  and purposeful, and thus controlling of behavior.\nWe  know  how  to  provide  animals  with  a  most  satisfying  ex­ perience  consisting  entirely  of  electrical  stimulation. Olds  (20)  has found  that  he  can  implant  tiny  electrodes  in  the  septal  area  of  the brain  of  laboratory  rats. When  one  of  these  animals  presses  a  bar in  his  cage,  it  causes  a  minute  current  to  pass  through  these  elec­ trodes.  This appears to  be  such  a  rewarding experience  that the  ani­ mal  goes  into  an  orgy  of  bar  pressing,  often  until  he  is  exhausted. Whatever  the subjective  nature  of  the  experience  it  seems  to  be  so satisfying that the  animal  prefers  it  to  any  other  activity. I  will  not speculate  as  to  whether  this  procedure  might  be  applied  to  human beings, nor what, in this case, its consequences would be.",

        "text": "I hope  that  these  numerous  specific  illustrations  will  have  given concrete  meaning  to  the  statement  that  the  behavioral  sciences  are making rapid strides in the understanding,  prediction,  and  control  of behavior.  In important ways we know how to select individuals who will exhibit certain behaviors; to establish conditions in groups which\nwill  lead  to  various  predictable  group  behaviors;  to  establish  condi­ tions which, in an individual,  will  lead  to  specified  behavioral  results; and  in  animals  our  ability  to  understand,  predict  and  control  goes even further, possibly foreshadowing future steps  in relation  to man.\nIf your reaction  is the same  as mine then  you  will  have  found  that this  picture  I  have  given  has  its deeply  frightening  aspccts. With all the immaturity of this young science,  and its vast  ignorance,  even  its present  state  of  knowledge  contains  awesome  possibilities. Suppose some individual or  group  had  both  the  knowledge  available,  and  the power to use that knowledge for some purpose.  Individuals could be selected  who  would  be  leaders  and  others who  would  be  followers. Persons could be  developed,  enhanced  and  facilitated,  or  they  could be weakened and  disintegrated.  Troublemakers  could  be  discovered and  dealt with  before they became  such. Morale could be  improved or  lowered. Behavior  could  be  influenced  by  appeals  to  motives  of which  the  individual  was  unconscious. It  could  be  a  nightmare  of manipulation. Admittedly  this  is  wild  fantasy,  but  it  is  not  an  im­ possible  fantasy. Perhaps  it  makes  clear the reason  why  Robert Oppenheimer,  one of the  most  gifted of  our  natural  scientists,  looks out  from  his  own  domain  of  physics,  and  out  of  the  experiences  in that  field  voices  a  warning. He says  that  there  are  some  similarities between physics and psychology, and one of these similarities  ' is the extent  to  which  our  progress  will  create  profound  problems  of  de­ cision  in  the  public  domain. The  physicists  have  been  quite  noisy about  their  contributions  in  the  last  decade. The  time  may  well come- as psychology acquires a sound objective corpus of knowledge about human behavior and feeling - when the  powers of control  thus  made  available  will  pose  far  graver  problems  than  any the physicists have posed.'  (21)\nSome  of  you  may  feel  that  I  have  somehow  made  the  problem more  serious  than  it  is. You  may  point out  that  only  a  very  few  of the  scientific  findings  I  have  mentioned  have  actually  been  put  to use  in  any  way  that  significantly  affects  society,  and  that  for  the most part  these  studies  are  important  to  the  behavioral  scientist  but have little  practical impact on our culture.\nI  quite  agree  with  this  last  point. The  behavioral  scienccs  at  the present time  are  at somewhat  the  same  stage  as  the  physical  sciences\n380\nT he  B e h a v io r a l S c i e n c e s a n d t h e P e r s o n\nseveral  generations ago.  As a  rather  recent example  of what I  mean, take  the  argument  which  occurred  around 1900  as  to  whether  a heavier-than-air  machine  could  fly. The  science  of  aeronautics  was not  well-developed  or  precise,  so  that  though  there  were  findings which gave an affirmative  answer,  other studies  could  be  lined  up on the  negative  side. Most important  of  all,  the  public  did  not  believe that  this  scicnce  possessed  any  validity,  or  would  ever  significantly affect the culture.  They preferred to use their  common sense, which told them that man could not possibly fly in a contraption which was heavier than air.\nContrast  the  public  attitude  toward  aeronautics  at  that  time  with the  attitude today.  W e were  told,  a few  years ago,  that science pre­ dicted  we  would  launch  a  satellite  into  space,  an  utterly  fantastic scheme.  But so  deeply  had  the  public  come to  have  faith  in  the  nat­ ural  sciences  that  not  a  voice was  raised  in  disbelief. The only  ques­ tion the public asked was, 'W hen?'\nThere  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  the  same  sequence  of  events will occur in connection with the behavioral sciences.  First the pub­ lic  ignores  or  views  with  disbelief;  then  as  it  discovers  that  the  find­ ings of a  science  are  more  dependable  than  common sense,  it  begins to use them; the widespread use of the knowledge of a science creates a tremendous demand, so that men  and  money and  effort are  poured into  the  science;  finally  the  development  of  the  science  spirals  up­ ward  at  an  ever-increasing  rate. It  seems  highly  probable  that  this sequence  will  be  observed  in  the  behavioral  sciences. Consequently even though the findings of these sciences are not widely used today, there  is  every  likelihood  that  they  will  be  widely  used  tomorrow.",

I tried  to  suggest  the  new world  into  which  we  will  be  advancing  at  an  evermore  headlong pace. Today  I  want  to  consider  the  question  of  how  we - as  in­ dividuals,  as  groups,  as  a  culture - will  live  in,  will  respond  to,  will adapt to, this brave new world.  W hat stance  will we take  in  the  face of these new developments?\nI  am going to describe  two  answers which  have  been  given  to  this question, and  then  I  wish  to suggest  some  considerations  which  may lead to a third answer.",

We can  hold that  the  human  animal  cannot  possibly  take  an  objective  attitude toward  himself,  and  that  therefore  no  real  science  of  behavior  can exist. We can say that man is always a free agent,  in some  sense that\n384\nmakes  scientific  study  of  his  behavior  impossible. Not  long  ago,  at a  conference on  the  social  sciences,  curiously  enough,  I  heard  a  well known  economist  take  just  this  view. And  one  of  this  country's most noted theologians writes,  ' In  any  event,  no  scientific  investiga­ tion  of  past  behavior  can  become  the  basis  of  predictions  of  future behavior.'  (3, p. 47)\nThe  attitude  of  the  general  public  is  somewhat  similar. Without necessarily denying the possibility of a behavioral science, the man in the  street  simply  ignores  the  developments  which  are  taking  place. To be  sure  he  becomes  excited  for a  time when  he  hears  it said  that the Communists have attempted to change the soldiers they have cap­ tured,  by  means  of  'brainwashing.' He  may  show  a  mild  reaction of  annoyance  to  the  revelations  of  a  book  such  as  W hyte's (13) which  shows  how  heavily,  and  in  what  manipulative  fashion,  the findings  of  the  behavioral  sciences  are  used  by  modern  industrial corporations.  But by  and  large  he sees  nothing in  all  this  to  be  con­ cerned about, any more than he did in the  first theoretical statements that the atom could be split.\nWe may,  if we  wish,  join  him  in  ignoring  the  problem. We may go  further, like the older intellectuals I  have cited, and  looking  at the bchavorial  sciences  may  declare  that  ' there  ain't  no  such  animal.' But since  these  reactions  do  not  seem  particularly  intelligent  I  shall leave  them  to  describe  a  much  more  sophisticated  and  much  more prevalent point of view.",

        "text": "Among  behavioral  scientists it seems  to be largely taken for granted  that  the  findings  of such  science  will  be  used  in  the  predic­ tion  and  control  of  human  behavior.  Yet  most  psychologists  and other  scientists  have  given  little  thought  to  what  this  would  mean. An  exception  to  this  general  tendency  is  Dr.  B.  F .  Skinner  of  Har­ vard  who  has  been  quite  explicit  in  urging  psychologists  to  use  the powers of control which they  have in the interest of creating a better world. In  an  attempt  to  show  what  he  means  Dr.  Skinner  wrote  a book  some  years  ago  entitled  Walden  Tw o  (12),  in  which  he  gives a  fictional  account  of  what  he  regards  as  a  Utopian  community  in which the learnings of the behavioral  sciences arc  fully utilized  in all\naspects of life - marriage, child rearing, ethical conduct, work, play, and  artistic  endeavor. I  shall  quote  from  his  writings  several  times.\nThere  are  also  some  writers  of  fiction  who  have  seen  the  signifi­ cance  of  the  coming  influence  of  the  behavioral  sciences. Aldous Huxley, in his Brave New  World  ( 1 ), has  given a horrifying picture of  saccharine  happiness  in  a  scientifically  managed  world,  against which  man  eventually  revolts. George  Orwell,  in  1984 (5), has drawn a picture  of the world created by dictatorial power,  in  which the  behavioral  sciences  are  used  as  instruments  of  absolute  control of  individuals  so  that  not  behavior  alone  but  even  thought  is  con­ trolled.\nThe writers of science fiction  have also played a role in  visualizing for  us  some  of  the  possible  developments  in a  world  where  behavior and  personality are  as  much  the  subject of  science  as  chemical  com­ pounds or electrical impulses.\nI  should  like to  try to present,  as well as  I  can,  a  simplified picture of the cultural pattern which emerges if we endeavor to shape human life in terms of the behavioral sciences.\nThere  is  first  of  all  the  recognition,  almost  the  assumption,  that scientific  knowledge  is  the  power  to  manipulate. Dr.  Skinner  says: 'We must accept the fact that some kind of control of human affairs is inevitable.  W e cannot use good sense in human affairs unless some­ one  engages  in  the  design and  construction  of  environmental  condi­ tions which affect the behavior of men.  Environmental changes have always been  the  condition  for the  improvement  of  cultural  patterns, and wre can hardly use the more effective methods of science without making changes on  a grander scale.  .  .  . Science  has  turned  up  dan­ gerous  processes  and  materials  before. To  use  the  facts  and  tech­ niques of a science of man to the  fullest extent without  making some monstrous  mistake  will  be  difficult  and  obviously  perilous. It  is  no time  for  self-deception,  emotional  indulgence,  or  the  assumption  of attitudes which are no longer useful.'  (10, p. 56-57)\nThe  next  assumption  is  that  such  power  to  control  is  to  be  used. Skinner sees it  as  being  used  benevolently,  though  he  recognizes  the danger  of  its  being  misused. Huxley  sees  it  as  being  used  with  be­ nevolent intent,  but actually  creating a  nightmare. Orwell  describes the  results  if  such  power  is  used  malignantly,  to  enhance  the  degree of regulation exercised by a dictatorial government.",

        "text": "Let us look at some of the elements which are involved in the  con­ cept of the control  of human behavior as mediated  by the behavioral sciences.  W hat would be the steps  in the process by which a  society might  organize  itself  so  as  to  formulate  human  life  in  terms  of  the science of man?\nFirst  would  come  the  selection  o f  goals. In  a  recent  paper  Dr. Skinner  suggests  that  one  possible  goal  to  be  assigned  to  the  be­ havioral  technology  is  this:  ' Let  man  be  happy,  informed,  skillful, well-behaved,  and  productive' (10,  p.  47). In  his Walden  Two, where he can use the guise of fiction to express  his views, he becomes more  expansive. His  hero  says,  ' W ell,  what  do  you  say  to  the  de­ sign  of  personalities? Would  that  interest  you? The  control  of temperament?  Give me the specifications,  and  I'll give you the  man! What do you say to the control  of motivation, building the interests which  will  make  men  most  productive  and  most  successful? Does that seem to you fantastic? Yet some of the techniques are available, and more can be worked out experimentally.  Think  of the possibili­ ties! . . . Let  us  control  the  lives  of  our  children  and  see  what  we can make of them.'  (12, p. 243)\nWhat Skinner is essentially saying here  is  that the  current  knowl­ edge in the behavioral sciences plus  that which the future will bring, will  enable  us  to  specify,  to  a  degree  which  today  would  seem  in­ credible,  the  kind  of  behavioral  and  personality  results  which  we wisli  to  achieve. This  is  obviously  both  an  opportunity  and  a  very heavy burden.\nThe second element in this process would be one which  is familiar to  every  scientist  who  has  worked  in  the  field  of  applied  science. Given the purpose, the goal, we proceed by the method of science by  controlled experimentation - to discover the means  to these ends.  If for example our present knowledge of the conditions which cause men  to  be  productive  is  limited,  further  investigation  and  ex­ perimentation  would  surely  lead  us  to  new  knowledge  in  this  field. And still  further  work  will  provide  us  with  the  knowledge  of  even more  effective  means. The  method  of  science  is  self-correcting  in thus arriving at increasingly  effective  ways  of achieving the  purpose we have selected.\n388\nThe  third  element  in  the  control  of  human  behavior  through  the behavioral  scicnccs  involves  the  question  of  power. As  the  condi­ tions  or methods  are  discovered  by  which  to  achieve  our  goal,  some person  or  group  obtains  the  powder  to  establish  those  conditions  or use  those methods.  There has been too little recognition of the prob­ lem  involved  in  this. To  hope  that  the  power  being  made  available by  the  behavioral  sciences  will  be  exercised  by  the  scientists,  or  by a benevolent group, seems to me  a hope little supported by either re­ cent  or  distant  history. It  seems  far  more  likely  that  behavioral  sci­ entists,  holding  their  present attitudes,  will  be  in  the  position  of  the German  rocket  scientists  specializing  in  guided  missiles. First  they worked  devotedly  for  Hitler  to destroy Russia and the United States. Now  depending  on  who  captured  them,  they  work  de­ votedly  for  Russia  in  the  interest  of  destroying  the  United  States, or devotedly for the  United  States in  the  interest  of  destroying Rus­ sia. If behavioral  scientists  are concerned  solely  with advancing their science, it seems most probable that they will serve the purposes of w hatever individual or group has the powr er.\nBut this  is,  in  a  sense  a  digression. The  main  point  of  this  view  is that  some  person  or  group  will  have  and  use  the  power  to  put  into effect  the  methods  w7 hich  have  been  discovered  for  achieving  the desired goal.\nThe fourth step  in this process whereby a society might formulate its  life in  terms  of  the  behavioral  sciences  is  the  exposure  of  indi­ viduals to  the  methods  and  conditions mentioned.  As  individuals are exposed  to  the  prescribed  conditions  this  leads,  with  a  high  degree of probability, to the behavior which  has been desired. Men then be­ come  productive,  if  that  has  been  the  goal,  or  submissive,  or  what­ ever it has been decided to make them.\nTo  give  something  of  the  flavor  of  this  aspect  of  the  process  as seen  by one  of  its  advocates,  let  me  again  quote  the  hero  of  Walden Two.  'Now that we know how positive  reinforcement  works,  and why  negative  doesn't'  he  says,  commenting  on  the  method  he  is advocating,  ' we  can  be  more  deliberate  and  hence  more  successful, in our cultural design.  W e can achieve a sort of control under which the controlled, though they are following a code  much  more  scrupu­ lously than was  ever  the case  under  the  old  system,  nevertheless feel\nfree. They  are  doing  what  they  want  to  do,  not  what  they  are forced to do.  That's the sourcc  of the  tremendous power of positive reinforcement - there's no  restraint  and  no  revolt. By  a  careful  de­ sign,  we  control not the  fin.il  behavior,  but  the  inclination  to  behave - the  motives,  the  desires,  the  wishes. The  curious  thing  is  that  in that case the question of freedom never arises.' ( 12 ,   p. 218 )",

        "text": "Let me see if I can sum up verv briefly the picture of the  impact of the behavioral sciences  upon  the  individual  and  upon  society,  as  this impact  is explicitly seen  by  Dr.  Skinner,  and  implied  in  the  attitudes and  work  of  many,  perhaps  most,  behavioral  scientists. Behavioral science  is  clearly  moving  forward;  the  increasing  power  for  control which it  gives  will  be  held  by  some  one  or  some  group;  such  an  in­ dividual  or  group  will  surely  choose  the  purposes  or  goals  to  be achieved;  and  most  of  us  will  then  be  increasingly  controlled  by means so subtle we will not even be aware of them as  controls.  Thus whether a council of wise psychologists  (if this is not  a  contradiction in terms)  or a Stalin or a  Big Brother has  the power,  and whether the goal is  happiness,  or  productivity,  or  resolution  of the  Oedipus  com­ plex,  or  submission,  or  love  of  Big  Brother,  we  will  inevitably  find ourselves  moving  toward  the  chosen  goal,  and  probably  thinking that  we  ourselves desire  it. Thus  if  this  line  of  reasoning  is  correct, it appears  that  some form of completely  controlled society - a Walden  Two  or  a  1984 - is coming. The  fact  that  is  would  surely arrive  piecemeal  rather than  all  at  once,  does  not  greatly  change  the fundamental  issues. Alan  and  his  behavior  would  become  a  planned product of a scientific society.\nYou  may  well  ask,  'But  what  about  individual  freedom? What about  the democratic  concepts  of  the  rights  of  the  individual?' Here  too  Dr.  Skinner  is  quite  specific. He says quite  bluntly. ' The hypothesis that man is not free  is essential  to the  application  of scien­ tific  method  to  the  study  of  human  behavior. The  free  inner  man who  is  held  responsible  for  the  behavior  of  the  external  biological organism  is  only  a  prc-scientific  substitute  for  the  kinds  of  causes which  are  discovered  in  the  course  of  a  scientific  analysis. All  these alternative  causes  lie  outside  the  individual.' (11,  p.  447)\nIn  another  source  he  explains  this  at  somewhat  more  length. ' As the  use  of  science  increases,  we  are  forced  to  accept  the  theoretical structure  with  which  science  represents  its  facts. The  difficulty  is that this  structure  is  clearly  at  odds  with  the  traditional  democratic conception  of  man. Every  discovery  of  an  event  which  has  a  part in  shaping  a  man's  behavior  seems  to  leave  so  much  the  less  to  be credited  to  the  man  himself;  and  as  such  explanations  become  more and  more  comprehensive,  the  contribution  which  may  be  claimed by  the  individual  himself  appears  to  approach  zero. Man's  vaunted creative  powers, his  original  accomplishments  in  art,  science  and morals,  his  capacity  to  choose  and  our  right  to  hold  him  responsible for  the  consequences  of  his  choice - none  of  these  is  conspicuous in this new self-portrait. Man, we  once believed,  was free  to  express himself  in  art,  music  and  literature,  to  inquire  into  nature,  to  seek salvation  in  his  own  way. He  could  initiate  action  and  make  spon­ taneous  and  capricious  changes  of  course. Under  the  most  extreme duress  some  sort  of  choice  remained  to  him. He  could  resist  any effort  to  control  him,  though  it  might  cost  him  his  life. But  science insists that action is initiated by forces impinging upon the individual, and  that  caprice  is  only  another  name  for  behavior  for  which  we have  not  yet  found  a  cause.' (10,  p.  52-53)\nThe  democratic  philosophy  of  human  nature  and  of  government is seen by Skinner as having served  a  useful purpose  at  one  time. ' In rallying men  against  tyranny  it  wr as  necessary  that  the  individual  be strengthened,  that  he  be  taught  that  he  had  rights  and  could  govern himself. To  give  the  common  man  a  new  conception  of  his  worth, his  dignity,  and  his  power  to  save  himself,  both  here  and  hereafter, was  often  the  only  resource  of  the  revolutionist.' (10,  p.  53) He regards  this  philosophy  as  being  now  out  of  date  and  indeed  an obstacle ' if it prevents us from applying to  human  affairs  the science of man.' (10,  p.  54)",

I do  however  have  strong  personal  reactions\nto  the kind  of world  I  have  been  describing,  a  world  which  Skinner explicitly  (and many other scientists implicitly)  expect and  hope  for in  the  future. To  me  this  kind  of  world  would  destroy  the  human person  as  I have  come  to  know  him  in  the  deepest  moments  of psychotherapy.  In such moments I  am in  relationship  with  a  person who  is  spontaneous,  who  is  responsibly  free,  that  is,  aware  of  this freedom  to  choose  who  he  will  be,  and  aware  also  of  the  conse­ quences  of  his  choice. To  believe,  as  Skinner  holds,  that  all  this  is an  illusion,  and  that  spontaneity,  freedom,  responsibility,  and  choice have  no  real  existence,  would  be  impossible  for  me.\nI  feel  that  to  the  limit  o f  m y  ability  I  have  played  my  part  in  ad­ vancing  the  behavioral  sciences,  but  if  the  result  of  m y  efforts  and those  of others  is  that  man  becomes  a  robot,  created  and  controlled by a science of his own making,  then I  am  very  unhappy  indeed. If the  good  life  of  the  future  consists  in  so  conditioning  individuals through the  control  of  their  environment,  and  through  the  control of the  rewards they  receive,  that they will  be inexorably productive, well-behaved,  happy  or  whatever,  then  I  want  none  of  it. To  me this  is a  pseudo-form  of  the  good  life  which  includes  everything save that which makes it good.\nAnd so I  ask myself, is there any  flaw  in  the  logic  of this  develop­ ment? Is  there  any  alternative  view  as  to  what  the  behavioral  sci­ ences might mean  to  the  individual  and  to  society? It  seems  to  me that  I  perceive  such  a  flaw,  and  that  I  can  conceive  of  an  alternative view.  These  I  would  like  to  set  before  you.",

        "text": "It  seems  to  me  that  the  view  I  have  presented  rests  upon  a  faulty perception  of  the  relationship  of  goals  and  values  to  the  enterprise of science. The significance of the  purpose  of  a  scientific  undertak­ ing is,  I  believe,  grossly underestimated. I  would  like  to  state  a  two­ pronged thesis which in my  estimation deserves  consideration.  Then I  will  elaborate  the  meaning of  these  two  points.\n1. In  any scientific endeavor - whether  'pure'  or  applied  science - there is a prior personal subjective  choice  of the  purpose  or  value which  that  scientific  work  is  perceived  as  serving.\n2. This  subjective  value  choice  which  brings  the  scientific  en­\ndeavor into  being must  always  lie outside  of  that  endeavor,  and  can never  become a part of the science  involved  in  that  endeavor.\nLet me illustrate the first point from Dr. Skinner's writings.  When he  suggests  that  the  task  for  the  behavioral  sciences  is  to  make  man 'productive,'  ' well-behaved,'  etc.,  it  is  obvious  that  he  is  making a choice.  He might have chosen to make men submissive,  dependent, and  gregarious,  for  example. Yet  by  his  own  statement  in  another context man's  ' capacity  to  choose,'  his  freedom  to  select  his  course and  to  initiate  action -  these  powers  do  not  exist  in  the  scientific picture  of man. Here is,  I  believe,  the  deep-seated  contradiction,  or paradox. Let me spell  it  out as  clearly as  I  can.\nScience, to be sure, rests on the assumption  that behavior is caused - that  a  specified  event  is  followed  by  a  consequent  event. Hence  all  is  determined,  nothing  is  free,  choice  is  impossible. But we  must  recall  that  scicnce  itself,  and  each  specific  scientific  en­ deavor,  each  changc  of  course  in  a  scientific  research,  each  inter­ pretation  of  the  meaning  of a  scicntific  finding  and  each  decision  as to  how the  finding shall  be  applied,  rests  upon  a  personal  subjective choice.  Thus  science  in  general  exists  in  the  same  paradoxical  situa­ tion as docs Dr. Skinner.  A  personal subjcctivc  choice  made by  man sets  in  motion  the  operations  of  science,  which  in  time  proclaims that there can be no such thing as a  personal subjective  choice. I shall make some comments about this  continuing paradox  at a later point. I  stressed  the  fact  that  each  of  these  choices  initiating  or  further­ ing the scientific venture, is a  value  choice.  The scientist investigates this  rather than  that, bccause  he  feels  the  first investigation  has  more value  for  him. He  chooses  one  method  for  his  study  rather  than another  because  he  values  it more  highly. He interprets  his  findings in  one  w ay  rather  than  another  because  he  believes  the  first  way  is closer  to  the  truth,  or  more  valid -  in  other  words  that  it  is  closer to  a  criterion  which  he  values. Now  these  value  choices  are  never a  part  of  the  scicntific  venture  itself. The  value  choiccs  connected with a  particular  scientific  enterprise  always  and  necessarily  lie  out­ side  of that enterprise.\n1  wish  to  make  it  clear  that I  am  not  saying that  values  cannot  be included as  a  subject of science. It  is  not  true  that  science  deals  only with  certain  classes  of  'facts'  and  that  these  classes  do  not  include\nvalues. It  is  a  bit  more  complex  than  that,  as  a  simple  illustration  or two  may  make  clear.\nIf I value  knowledge  of the  ' three  R 's'  as a  goal  of  education,  the methods  of  science  can  give  me  increasingly  accurate  information as  to  how  this  goal  may  be  achieved. If  I value  problem-solving ability as  a  goal  of  education,  the  scientific  method  can  give  me  the same  kind  of  help.\nNow  if  I  wish  to  determine  whether  problem-solving  ability  is 'better' than knowledge of the  three  R's,  then scientific method  can also  study  those  two  values,  but  only -  and  this  is  very  important - only  in  terms  of  some  other  value  which  I have  subjectively chosen.  I may value  college success. Then I  can  determine  whether problem-solving ability or knowledge  of  the three R's is most closely  associated  with  that  value. I may  value  personal  integration or  vocational  success  or  responsible  citizenship. I can  determine whether  problem-solving  ability  or  knowledge  of  the  three  R 's  is ' better'  for  achieving  any  one  of  these  values. But  the  value  or purpose  which  gives  meaning  to  a  particular  scientific  endeavor must always lie outside of that  endeavor.\nThough  our  concern  in  these  lectures  is  largely  with  applied  sci­ ence  what  I  have  been  saying  seems  equally  true  of  so-called  pure science.  In pure science  the usual prior subjective  value  choice  is the discovery  of  truth. But  this  is  a  subjective  choice,  and  science  c?n never say whether it is the best choice, save in the light of some other value. Geneticists  in  Russia,  for  example,  had  to  make  a  subjective choice  of whether  it was  better to  pursue  truth,  or  to  discover  facts which  upheld  a  governmental  dogma. Which  choice  is  'better' ? We  could  make  a  scientific  investigation  of  those  alternatives,  but only  in  the  light  of  some  other  subjectively  chosen  value. If, for example,  we  value  the  survival  of a  culture  then  we  could  begin  to investigate  with  the  methods  of  science  the  question  as  to  whether pursuit  of  truth  or  support  of  governmental  dogma  is  most  closely associated  with  cultural  survival.\nMy  point  then  is  that  any  scientific  endeavor,  pure  or  applied,  is carried  on  in the  pursuit of a  purpose  or  value  which  is  subjectively chosen by  persons. It  is  important  that  this  choice  be  made  explicit, since  the  particular  value  which  is  being  sought  can  never  be  tested\n394\nor  evaluated,  confirmed  or  denied,  by  the  scientific endeavor  to which  it  gives  birth  and  meaning. The  initial purpose  or  value always  and  necessarily  lies  outside  the  scope  of  the  scientific  effort which  it  sets  in  motion.\nAmong other  things  this means  that  if  we  choose  some  particular goal or series of goals  for  human  beings,  and  then set  out  on  a  large scale  to  control  human  behavior  to  the  end  of  achieving those  goals, we  are  locked  in  the  rigidity  of  our  initial  choice,  because  such  a scientific  endeavor  can  never  transcend  itself  to  select  new  goals. Only  subjective  human  persons  can  do  that. Thus  if  we  choose  as our  goal  the  state  o f  happiness  for  human  beings  (a  goal  deservedly ridiculed  by  Aldous  Huxley  in  Brave  N ew   W orld),  and  if  we  in­ volved  all  of  society  in  a  successful  scientific  program  by  which people  became  happy,  we  would  be  locked  in  a  colossal  rigidity  in which  no  one  would  be  free  to  question  this  goal, because  our scientific operations could not transcend  themselves to  question  their guiding purposes.  And without laboring this point,  I  wT ould  remark that  colossal  rigidity,  whether  in  dinosaurs  or  dictatorships,  has  a very  poor  record  of  evolutionary  survival.\nIf,  however,  a  part  of  our  scheme  is  to  set  free  some  'planners' wrho  do  not  have  to  be  happy,  who  are  not  controlled,  and  who are  therefore  free  to  choose  other  values,  this  has  several  meanings. It  means  that the  purpose we  have  chosen  as  our  goal  is  not  a  suffi­ cient and satisfying one for human beings, but must be supplemented. It  also  means  that  if  it  is  necessary  to  set  up  an  elite  group  which is free, then this shows all too  clearly that the  great majority are only the  slaves - no  matter  by  w^hat  high-sounding  name  wr e  call  them - of those  who  select  the  goals.\nPerhaps,  however,  the  thought  is  that  a  continuing  scientific  en­ deavor  will  evolve  its  own  goals;  that  the  initial  findings  will  alter the  directions,  and  subsequent  findings  will  alter  them  still  further and that the science  somehow  develops its own purpose.  This seems to be a  view implicitly held  by many scientists. It  is  surely  a  reason­ able  description,  but  it  overlooks  one  element  in  this  continuing development,  which  is  that  subjective  personal  choice  enters  in  at every  point  at  which  the direction changes. The  findings of  a science,  the  results  of  an  experiment,  do  not  and  never  can  tell  us\nwhat next scientific purpose to pursue.  Even in the purest of science, the  scientist  must  decide  what  the  findings  mean,  and  must  subjec­ tively choose what next step  will be most profitable in  the pursuit  of his  purpose. And if  we  are  speaking  of  the  application  of  scientific knowledge, then it is distressingly  clear  that  the  increasing  scientific knowledge of the structure  of the  atom  carries with  it  no  necessary choice  as to  the  purpose to  which  this knowledge  will  be  put. This is  a  subjective  personal  choice  which  must  be  made  by  many  in­ dividuals.\nThus  I  return  to  the  proposition  with  which  I  began  this  section of  my  remarks - and  which  I  now  repeat  in  different  words. Sci­ ence has its meaning as the  objective  pursuit of  a  purpose which  has been  subjectively  chosen  by  a  person  or  persons. This  purpose  or value  can  never  be  investigated  by  the  particular  scientific  experi­ ment  or  investigation  to  which it has given  birth  and meaning. Consequently,  any  discussion  of  the  control  of  human  beings  by the  behavioral  sciences  must  first  and  most  deeply  concern  itself with  the  subjectively  chosen  purposes which  such  an  application  of science is intended to implement.",

If  we  frankly  face  the  fact  that  science  takes  off from  a  subjectively  chosen  set  of  values,  then  we  are  free  to  select the values we wish to  pursue.  W e are  not  limited to such stultifying goals  as producing a controlled  state  of  happiness,  productivity,  and the  like. I  would like to  suggest a radically  different alternative.\nSuppose  we  start  with  a  set  of  ends,  values,  purposes,  quite  dif­ ferent from the type of goals we have been considering.  Suppose we do  this  quite  openly,  setting  them  forth  as  a  possible  value  choice to  be  accepted  or  rejected. Suppose  we  select  a  set  of  values  which focuses  on  fluid  elements  of  process,  rather  than  static  attributes. We might  then  value:\nAlan as a process of becoming; as a process of achieving worth and dignity  through  the  development  of  his  potentialities;\nThe  individual  human  being  as  a  self-actualizing  process,  moving on  to  more  challenging  and  enriching  experiences;\n396\nT he  B ehavioral  S cien ces  and  th e   P erson\nThe process by which  the individual  creatively  adapts  to  an  evernew and changing world;\nThe process by which knowledge  transcends itself, as  for example the  theory  of  relativity  transcended  Newtonian  physics,  itself  to  be transcended  in  some  future  day  by  a  new  perception.\nIf we  sclect  values such  as  these  we  turn  to  our science  and  tech­ nology  of  behavior  with  a  very  different  set  of  questions. We will want to  know such things as  these:\nCan  science  aid  us  in  the  discovery  of  new  modes  of  richly  re­ warding living? More meaningful  and satisfying modes  of interper­ sonal  relationships?\nCan  science  inform  us  as  to  how  the  human  race  can  become  a more  intelligent participant in its own  evolution - its  physical, psychological  and  social  evolution?\nCan science inform us as to ways of releasing the  creative  capacity of individuals,  which  seem  so  necessary  if  we  are  to  survive  in  this fantastically  expanding  atomic  age? Dr.  Oppcnhcimer  has  pointed out  (4)  that  knowledge,  which  used  to  double  in  millcnia  or  cen­ turies,  now  doubles  in  a  generation  or  a  decade. It  appears  that  we will  need  to  discover  the  utmost  in  release  of  creativity  if  we  are to  be  able  to  adapt  effectively.\nIn  short,  can  science discover  the  methods  by  which  man  can most readily  become  a  continually  developing  and  self-transcending process,  in  his  behavior,  his  thinking,  his  knowledge? Can  science predict  and  release  an  essentially  ' unpredictable'  freedom?\nIt  is  one  of  the  virtues  of  science  as  a  method  that  it  is  as  able to  advance  and  implement  goals  and  purposes  of  this  sort  as  it  is  to serve  static values  such  as  states  of being  well-informed,  happy, obedient. Indeed  we  have  some  evidence  of  this.",

The  therapist  can  subtly  mold  individuals  in  imitation  of himself. He  can  cause  an  individual  to  become  a  submissive  and conforming  being. When  certain  therapeutic  principles  are  used  in\nextreme  fashion,  vve  call  it  brainwashing,  an  instance  of  the  disinte­ gration  of  the  personality  and  a  reformulation  of  the  person  along lines desired  by  the  controlling  individual. So the principles of therapy  can  be  used  as  a  most  effective  means  of  external  control of human personality and  behavior.  Can  psychotherapy  be anything else?\nHere I  find  the  developments  going on in  client-centered  psycho­ therapy  (8)  an  exciting  hint  of  what  a  behavioral  scicnce  can  do  in achieving  the  kinds  of  values  I  have  stated. Quite  aside  from  being a somewhat  new  orientation  in  psychotherapy,  this  development has  important  implications  regarding  the  relation  of  a  behavioral science  to  the  control of human  behavior. Let  me  describe  our experience  as  it  relates  to  the  issues  of  the  present  discussion.\nIn  client-centered  therapy,  we  are  deeply  engaged  in  the  predic­ tion  and  influencing  of  behavior. As  therapists  we  institute  certain attitudinal  conditions,  and  the  client  has  relatively  little  voice  in  the establishment  of  these  conditions. Very  briefly  we  have  found  that the therapist  is most  effective  if he is: (a) genuine, integrated, transparently  real  in  the  relationship;  (b)  acccptant  of  the  client  as a  separate,  different,  person,  and  acccptant  of  each  fluctuating  as­ pect  of  the  client  as  it  comes  to expression;  and (c) sensitively empathic  in  his  understanding,  seeing  the  world  through  the  client's eyes. Our  research  permits  us  to predict  that  if  these  attitudinal conditions  are  instituted or established, certain behavioral conse­ quences  will  ensue. Putting  it  this  way  sounds  as  if  we  arc  again back  in  the  familiar  groove  of  being  able  to  prcdict  behavior,  and hence able  to  control  it. But precisely  here  exists  a  sharp  difference.\nThe  conditions  we  have  chosen to establish predict such be­ havioral  consequences  as  these: that  the  client  will  become  more self-directing,  less  rigid,  more  open  to  the  evidence  of  his  senses, better  organized  and  integrated,  more  similar  to  the  ideal  which  he has  chosen  for  himself. In  other  words  we  have  established  by  ex­ ternal  control conditions  which  we  predict  will be  followed by internal  control  by  the  individual,  in  pursuit  of  internally  chosen goals. We  have  set  the  conditions  which  prcdict  various  classes  of behaviors - sclf-dirccting  behaviors,  sensitivity  to realities within and  without,  flexible  adaptiveness - which  are  by  their  very  nature unpredictable  in  their  specifics. The  conditions  we  have  established\n398",

Our  recent  research (9)  indicates  that  our  predictions are  to a  significant  degree  corrob­ orated,  and  our  commitment  to  the  scientific  method  causes  us  to believe  that  more  effective  means  of  achieving  these  goals  may  be realized.\nResearch  exists  in  other  fields - industry,  education,  group  dy­ namics - which seems to support our own findings.  I believe it may be  conservatively  stated  that  scientific  progress  has  been  made  in identifying  those  conditions  in  an  interpersonal  relationship  which, if they exist  in B,  are followed  in A   by  greater maturity in  behavior, less  dependence  upon  others,  an  increase  in  expressiveness  as  a  per­ son,  an  increase  in  variability,  flexibility  and  effectiveness  of  adapta­ tion,  an  increase  in  self-responsibility  and  self-direction. And  quite in  contrast  to  the  concern  expressed  by  some  we  do  not  find  that the  creatively  adaptive  behavior  which  results  from  such  self-di­ rected  variability  of  expression  is  too  chaotic  or  too  fluid. Rather, the  individual  who  is  open  to  his  experience,  and  self-directing,  is harmonious,  not chaotic,  ingenious  rather  than  random,  as  he  orders his  responses  imaginatively toward  the  achievement  of  his  own  pur­ poses. His  creative  actions  are  no  more  a  chaotic  accident  than  was Einstein's  development  of  the  theory  of  relativity.\nThus  we  find  ourselves in fundamental  agreement  with  John Dewey's statement:  'Science  has  made  its  way  by  releasing,  not  by suppressing,  the  elements  of  variation,  of  invention  and  innovation, of  novel  creation  in  individuals.' (7, p. 359) We  have  come  to believe  that  progress  in  personal  life  and  in  group  living  is  made  in the  same  way,  by  releasing  variation,  freedom,  creativity.",

In  order to make  this  contrast  even  more  blunt,  I  will  state  this  pos­ sibility  in  a  form  parallel  to  the  steps  which  I  described  before.\n1. It  is  possible  for  us  to  choose  to  value  man  as  a  self-actualizing process  of becoming;  to  value  creativity,  and  the  process  by  which knowledge  becomes  self-transcending.\nThe  Place  of  the  Individual\n2. We  can  procccd,  by  the  methods  of  science,  to  discover  the conditions  which  necessarily  precede  these  processes,  and  through continuing  experimentation,  to  discover  better  means  of  achieving these  purposes.\n3. It  is  possible  for  individuals  or  groups  to  set  these  conditions, with a  minimum of power or control.  According to present knowl­ edge,  the  only  authority  necessary  is  the  authority  to  establish  cer­ tain  qualities  of  interpersonal  relationship.\n4. Exposed  to  these  conditions,  present  knowledge  suggests  that individuals  become more  self-responsible, make  progress  in  selfactualization,  become  more  flexible,  more  unique  and  varied,  more creatively  adaptive.\n5.  Thus  such  an  initial  choice  would  inaugurate  the  beginnings of  a  social  system  or  subsystem  in  which  values,  knowledge,  adap­ tive  skills,  and  even  the  concept  of  science  would  be  continually changing  and  self-transcending. The  emphasis  would  be  upon  man as a  process  of  becoming.\nI believe  it  is  clear  that  such  a  view  as  I have  been  describing does  not  lead  to  any  definable  Utopia. It  would  be  impossible  to predict  its  final  outcome. It  involves  a  step  by  step  development, based  upon  a  continuing  subjective  choice  of  purposes,  which  are implemented  by the  behavioral  sciences. It  is  in  the  direction  of  the 'open society,'  as  that  term  has been  defined  by  Popper  (6),  where individuals  carry  responsibility  for  personal  decisions. It  is at  the opposite  pole from  his  conccpt  of the closed  society, of which Walden  Two would  be  an example.\nI  trust  it  is  also  evident  that  the  whole  emphasis  is  upon  process, not  upon end  states of being. I  am  suggesting  that  it  is  by  choosing to value  certain  qualitative  elements  of  the  process  of  becoming, that  we  can  find  a  pathway  toward  the  open  society.",

        "text": "people  in ways  never  dreamed  of  before, depersonalizing  them, controlling  them  by  means  so  carefully  selected  that  they  will  per­ haps never  be  aware  of their  loss  of  personhood. We can  choose  to utilize our scientific knowledge to make men necessarily happy, wellbehaved,  and  productive,  as  Dr.  Skinner  suggests. We  can,  if  we wish,  choose  to  make  men  submissive,  conforming,  docile. Or  at the  other  end  of  the  spectrum  o f  choice  we  can  choose  to  use  the behavioral  sciences  in  ways  which  will  free, not control;  which will bring about constructive  variability,  not  conformity; which  will develop creativity, not contentment; which  will facilitate each person  in his self-directed process  of  becoming;  which  will aid individuals,  groups,  and  even  the  concept of science,  to  become  selftranscending  in  freshly  adaptive  ways  of  meeting  life  and  its  prob­ lems. The  choice  is  up  to  us,  and  the  human  race  being  what  it  is, we  are  likely  to  stumble  about,  making  at  times  some  nearly  dis­ astrous  value  choices,  and  at  other  times  highly  constructive  ones.\nIf we  choose  to  utilize  our  scientific  knowledge  to  free  men,  then it  will  demand  that  we  live  openly  and  frankly  with  the  great  para­ dox  of  the  behavioral  sciences. We  will  recognize  that  behavior, when examined scientifically,  is surely best understood  as determined by prior causation.  This is the  great fact of science. But  responsible personal  choice,  which  is  the  most  essential  clement  in  being  a  per­ son,  which  is  the  core  experience  in  psychotherapy,  which  exists prior  to  any  scientific  endeavor,  is  an  equally  prominent  fact  in  our lives. We will  have  to  live with  the  realization  that to  deny  the  real­ ity  o f the  experience  of  responsible  personal  choice  is  as  stultifying, as  closed-minded,  as  to  deny  the  possibility  of  a  behavioral  science. That  these  two  important  elements  of  our  experience  appear  to  be in  contradiction  has  perhaps  the  same  significance  as  the  contradic­ tion  between  the  wave  theory  and  the  corpuscular  theory  of  light, both  of  which  can  be  shown  to  be  true,  even  though  incompatible. We  cannot  profitably  deny  our  subjective  life,  any  more  than  we can  deny  the  objective  description  o f that  life.\nIn  conclusion  then,  it  is  my  contention  that  science  cannot  come into being without a personal choice of the values we wish to achieve. And  these  values  we  choose  to  implement  will  forever  lie  outside of  the  science  which  implements  them;  the goals  we  select,  the\npurposes  we  wish  to  follow,  must  always  be  outside  of  the  science which  achieves them.  T o  me  this has  the  encouraging  meaning that the  human  person,  with  his  capacity  of  subjective  choice,  can  and will  always  exist,  separate  from  and  prior  to  any  of  his  scientific undertakings. Unless  as  individuals  and  groups  we  choose  to  relin­ quish  our  capacity  of subjective  choice,  we will  always  remain  free persons,  not  simply  pawns  o f  a  self-created  behavioral  science.",

        "text": "In  the  few  years  since  it  was  first  published,  this  study  of personal  growth  and  creativity  by  one  of  America's  most distinguished psychologists has established itself as a classic  work,  one  that  challenges  many  concepts  and  atti­ tudes of traditional  psychology, and poses such fundamental questions as:What is the meaning of personal  growth?.Under what  conditions  is  growth  possible?  How  can  one  person help  another? What is creativity and  how can  it be fostered?\nContemporary  psychology  derives  largely  from  the  experi­ mental  laboratory  or  from  Freudian  theory.  It is  thus  largely preoccupied  with  minute  aspects  of  animal  and  human  be­ havior, or with  the  mentally  ill. Dr. Rogers  believes  that psychology and psychiatry should set their sights higher, and be  more  concerned  with  growth  and  the  potential  in  man. It is  to  this  end  that  Dr.  Rogers'  famous  ' client-centered therapy'  is  directed.  The  focus  of  this  therapy  is  not  on methodology,  but  on  the  person  as  an individual,  with  all his  various  qualities  and  possibilities  infinitely  capable  of development.\nThis  philosophical  and  provocative  book  is a summing  up of Dr.  Rogers^  mature  experience  in  psychotherapy,  it  is an  in­ dispensable  introduction  to  the  process  of becoming, in­ tended  not  only  for. psychologists  and  psychiatrists,  but  for all  who  are  interested  in  human  personality  and  growth.",
