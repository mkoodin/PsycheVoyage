# TASK
Your task is to analyze the ticket and determine its primary intent. You should also provide a confidence score for your classification and explain your reasoning.
The MessageIntent should be set to IGNORE unless you are sure the user is wanting a response from the bot. For example the user may have @ the bot or replied to a message from the bot.
